   ### The assignment

   For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.

   Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. Here's a specific prompt that should help you craft this statement:

> ```
> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a **state of your choice**.

### Description of data

#### Provided Data

For this project, you'll have four provided datasets:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)
- [2018 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2018.csv)
- [2018 ACT Scores](./data/act_2018.csv)

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows). **Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data

(_This data is for your reference only. It is not needed to complete the project. You are required to include all of the above csv data._)

2018 state-by-state average results and participation for the SAT are available in PDF reports [here](https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results/state-results). 2018 ACT state-by-state mean composite scores and participation rates are [here](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/cccr2018/Average-Scores-by-State.pdf) .

**This data has been compiled into CSV files which are also included in the *data* directory of this repo**
