# Project 1: Standardized Testing, Statistical Summaries and Inference

 

**by Shawn Syms**



Welcome! In this report, we will look at the following: 



**Context**

- At the College Board, we’re a mission-driven not-for-profit organization that connects students to college success
- In service of that mandate, we revamped core aspects of our testing rubric in 2016
- Now, we have two subsequent years worth of data to help us assess progress and guide our next steps
- My data-science colleagues and I have been asked to review the aggregate scores and participation rates for SAT and our nearest competitor, ACT – and to incorporate any other necessary research, and share our observations and recommendations with you today

**Executive summary**

- We possess valuable data on participation rates and test scoring for SAT and ACT (which we will review today)

- We have conducted additional research to plot a secondary dataset that enhances our insights (which we will also review)

- This data charts the regulatory status of SAT and ACT at the state level across the country with regards to:

  1. mandating one test or the other, and 

  2. State financial coverage for one, either or both tests

- All of this data informs our recommendations  for future action and success

**Problem statement**

Given our internal and ACT-published data at hand, as well as supplementary research:

- What observations can be made in relation to scoring, statewide participation metrics, and any other relevant data, that can provide insights for our mission to increase SAT test-taker numbers across the country?
- And what recommendations for action can be drawn from this data?

**Project details**

We will explore the provided datasets as well as create a new one based on research. Through reviewing the data, we will make observations and propose high-level recommendations based on the data. The question of how the recommendations may best be implemented is outside of the scope of the project. 

The project is comprised of this README, a PDF of an oral presentation delivered 17 March 2020 and a Jupyter Notebook with coding and plotting that formed part of the data cleaning, exploration and analysis.
