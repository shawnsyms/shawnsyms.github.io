<a href="http://shawnsyms.github.io/reddit2rehab">reddit2rehab</a>: **Binary Classification Model:** Using requests, beautiful soup and the PushShift API, I captured 1000s of Reddit posts in subreddits devoted to either active substance use or recovery from addiction, and trained multiple machine-learning (ML) models to predict which subset (active use vs addiction recovery) a piece of writing came from. The best model had a 96% success rate.
