A Good and Wise Measure,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802048295.jpg,"The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783-1842

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Francis M. Carroll (CA)

In this detailed and fascinating book, Francis Carroll tells the story of the attempts to settle the original boundary between Canada and the United States from the Atlantic coast to the middle of the continent. Established by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, it soon became clear that ambiguities and errors in the treaty brought confusion and rivalry in the boundary borderland from New Brunswick and Maine to the St. Lawrence River, through the Great Lakes and from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods, in the heart of the continent. This borderland, steadily filling with people of competing interests - Loyalists and Yankees, fur traders and soldiers, Europeans and First Nations peoples - became the focus of the major crisis in Anglo-Canadian-American relations for almost sixty years. Drawing on extensive research and utilizing manuscript materials never brought to bear on the subject before, The Search for Boundary is the first work to thoroughly explain the efforts of the several Boundary Commissions and the failed arbitration of the King of Netherlands - all major international attempts to settle the boundary. The book also provides a fresh interpretation of the relevance the turbulent decade of the 1830s had in contributing to the sense of urgency that finally allowed for negotiation of a reasonable compromise settlement of the boundary in the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 -- ""A good and wise measure,"" as Lord Ashburton called it. Filled with the politics and intrigues of the time, Carroll brings to life a remarkable time in the diplomatic and political history of both Canada and the United States.Winner of the Dafoe Book Prize, awarded by the J.W. Dafoe Foundation

A Mile of Make-Believe,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442629240.jpg,"A History of the Eaton's Santa Claus Parade

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Steve Penfold

“A Mile of Make-Believe offers not only a highly readable and rewarding account of Santa Claus parades but a great many lessons that will help reshape the way in which scholars explore the history of consumerism.” – Michael Dawson, St. Thomas University

A Mile of Make-Believe examines the unique history of the Santa Claus parade in Canada. This volume focuses on the Eaton’s-sponsored parades that occurred in Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Edmonton. Steve Penfold’s considerable analytical skills have produced a work that is simultaneously a cultural history, history of business, and commentary on consumerism. Professional historians and the general public alike would be remiss if this wasn’t on their holiday wish list.

A Name for Herself,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487523084.jpg,"Selected Writings, 1891-1917

Author/Illustrator/Editor: L.M. Montgomery

Years before she published her internationally celebrated first novel, Anne of Green Gables, L.M. Montgomery (1874–1942) started contributing short works to periodicals across North America. While these works consisted primarily of poems and short stories, she also experimented with a wider range of forms, particularly during the early years of her career, at which point she tested out several authorial identities before settling on the professional moniker “L.M. Montgomery.”

A Name for Herself: Selected Writings, 1891–1917 is the first in a series of volumes collecting Montgomery’s extensive contributions to periodicals. Leading Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre discusses these so-called miscellaneous pieces in relation to the works of English-speaking women writers who preceded her and the strategies they used to succeed, including the decision to publish under gender-neutral signatures. Among the highlights of the volume are Montgomery’s contributions to student periodicals, a weekly newspaper column entitled “Around the Table,” a long-lost story narrated first by a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage and then by the man she wishes she had married instead, and a new edition of her 1917 celebrity memoir, “The Alpine Path.” Drawing fascinating links to Montgomery’s life writing, career, and fiction, this volume will offer scholars and readers alike an intriguing new look at the work of Canada’s most enduringly popular author.

A Polity on the Edge,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551112404.jpg,"Canada and the Politics of Fragmentation

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Harold D. Clarke (CA), Allan Kornberg (CA), Peter Wearing (CA)

Winner: 2001 Choice Outstanding Academic Book Award

This is a book about forces challenging the continued integrity of Canada, one of the world’s oldest and most admired democracies. It focuses on six critical events, beginning with the 1988 federal election and the fierce debate over the risks of free trade with the United States for Canada’s economy and cherished social programs. It ends with the 1998 re-election of the Parti Québécois and the possibility of a third sovereignty referendum. Collectively, these events have pushed Canada to the edge of disintegration. The book’s analyses and interpretations of these events are based on a unique collection of survey data gathered over the past two decades. Conversations with thousands of Canadians map the dynamics of public beliefs, attitudes and behavior in an era of economic dislocation and political crisis. Struggling to adapt its political institutions and processes to regional and ethno-linguistic cleavages invigorated by forces of economic restructuring and globalization, Canada exemplifies many of the ""forces from above and below"" that have beset democracies, new and old alike, in recent years. By explaining how these forces have brought a ""charter member"" of that very special political club to the brink of fragmentation, this book will be of interest to all those concerned with the future of democracy in polycommunal societies.

A World of Songs,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487523695.jpg,"Selected Poems, 1894-1921

Author/Illustrator/Editor: L.M. Montgomery

Celebrated as a novelist and made famous by her novel Anne of Green Gables and its sequels, L.M. Montgomery (1874–1942) is far less known for also writing and publishing hundreds of poems over a period of half a century.Although this output included a chapbook and a full-length collection in which she presented herself primarily as a nature poet, most of her poems appeared in periodicals, including women’s magazines, farm papers, faith-based periodicals, daily and weekly newspapers, and magazines for children. As a shrewd businesswoman, she learned to find the balance between literary quality and commercial saleability and continued to publish poetry even though it paid less than short fiction.

A World of Songs: Selected Poems, 1894–1921, the second volume in The L.M. Montgomery Library, gathers a selection of fifty poems originally published across a twenty-five-year period. Benjamin Lefebvre organizes this work within the context of Montgomery’s life and career, claiming her not only as a nature poet but also as the author of a wider range of “songs”: of place, of memory, of lamentation, of war, of land and sea, of death, and of love. Many of these poems echo motifs that readers of Montgomery’s novels will recognize, and many more explore surprising perspectives through the use of male speakers. These poems offer today’s readers a new facet of the career of Canada’s most enduringly popular author.

Academic Freedom in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802007261.jpg,"A History

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Horn, Michiel

Although currently under attack from several directions, academic freedom is as important as it has ever been in enabling academics to teach, to carry out research, and to offer disinterested criticism and advice.Michiel Horn’s new book accentuates the changing nature of academic freedom in English Canada and provides essential background to today’s discussions. Based on extensive archival research in more than twenty universities across Canada and in six public archives, the book locates the idea of academic freedom in its institutional and social contexts and traces its conflict-ridden evolution from 1860 to the present. Providing detailed coverage and analysis, Academic Freedom in Canada exposes previously unpublished information on why selected academics were dismissed or forced to resign, and on how pressure was used, often successfully, to silence others. As well as focusing on individuals such as Frank Underhill (University of Toronto), George Hunter (University of Alberta), and Harry Crowe (United College, Winnipeg), the book covers issues including the resistance in universities to Darwinist thought; the influences of modern Biblical criticism, capitalism, and war on academic freedom; the experience of women and ethnic minorities; and the question of whether or not academics should be allowed to run for public office. One chapter addresses the contentious issue of tenure.Michiel Horn also identifies and analyses the challenges that have faced academic freedom in more recent years, most notably those of the economy and of ‘political correctness’. He shows how the seeds of today’s changing demands on universities can be found in the vicissitudes of the past, and contends that Canadian academics owe it to their fellow citizens to use their freedom for the common good.

An Independent Foreign Policy for Canada?,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802096340.jpg,"Challenges and Choices for the Future

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Brian Bow, Patrick Lennox

Forty years ago, as the United States became increasingly involved in Vietnam, questions were raised in Canada about the relationship between its foreign policy agenda and that of its southern neighbour. Now, with the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is time to raise the same questions: does Canada need an independent foreign policy? Does Canada have the capacity and will to chart its own course?Divided into sections about the history of Canadian foreign policy, diplomacy, security, economics, decision-making and new policy issues, this collection of prominent political scientists provides valuable and timely perspectives on the state of Canada’s international relations in the twenty-first century. Examining pertinent issues such as defence, security, the Arctic, global environmental cooperation, NAFTA, and the post-9/11 world, these accessible and insightful essays are a long-overdue reassessment of Canada and its current role in international affairs. An Independent Foreign Policy for Canada? asks the question that is perhaps more important now than forty years ago and supplies answers so pertinent to the twenty-first century.

Anatomy of a Liberal Victory,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551114835.jpg,"Making Sense of the Vote in the 2000 Canadian Election

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Andre Blais (CA), Neil Nevitte (CA), Elisabeth Gidengil (CA), Richard Nadeau (CA)

Anatomy of a Liberal Victory: Making Sense of the Vote in the 2000 Canadian Election provides a compressive account of the factors that led Canadians to vote the way they did in the Fall 2000 Canadian election, which resulted in a third consecutive Liberal majority government. The book explains the overall impact that these factors had on how well or poorly each of the parties did in the election. The authors address in particular the following questions: Why was turnout so low? What were Canadians’ perceptions of the economy and how much impact did these perceptions have on vote choice? What were voters’ opinions on the major issues of the day and did these opinions affect their decision on election day? What did voters think of the leaders and how much weight did these evaluations have on their choice?

The study is based on mass surveys, involving more than 3,000 respondents, conducted both during the campaign and after the election. It also draws on a detailed content analysis of the parties’ messages and nightly news broadcasts throughout the campaign and its aftermath.

Arming and Disarming,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442646391.jpg,"A History of Gun Control in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: R. Blake Brown (CA), The Osgoode Society

From the École Polytechnique shootings of 1989 to the political controversy surrounding the elimination of the federal long-gun registry, the issue of gun control has been a subject of fierce debate in Canada. But in fact, firearm regulation has been a sharply contested issue in the country since Confederation. Arming and Disarming offers the first comprehensive history of gun control in Canada from the colonial period to the present.In this sweeping, immersive book, R. Blake Brown outlines efforts to regulate the use of guns by young people, punish the misuse of arms, impose licensing regimes, and create firearm registries. Brown also challenges many popular assumptions about Canadian history, suggesting that gun ownership was far from universal during much of the colonial period, and that many nineteenth century lawyers – including John A. Macdonald – believed in a limited right to bear arms.Arming and Disarming provides a careful exploration of how social, economic, cultural, legal, and constitutional concerns shaped gun legislation and its implementation, as well as how these factors defined Canada’s historical and contemporary ‘gun culture.’

He examines the resurrection of two of the most iconic and gendered dinosaurs: Tyrannosaurus rex, “king of the tyrant lizards,” and Maiasaura, “good mother lizard.” Noble places the political natures of these dinosaurs into high relief and raises vital questions about how our choices make a difference in what comes to count as “nature.”

Assisted Reproduction Policy in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487523190.jpg,"Framing, Federalism, and Failure

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Dave Snow

The world has undergone a revolution in assisted reproduction, as processes such as in vitro fertilization, embryonic screening, and surrogacy have become commonplace. Yet when governments attempt to regulate this field, they have not always been successful. Canada is a case in point: six years after the federal government created comprehensive legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada struck it down for violating provincial authority over health. In Assisted Reproduction Policy in Canada, Dave Snow provides the first historical exploration of Canadian assisted reproduction policy, from the 1989 creation of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies to the present day. Snow argues the federal government’s policy failure can be traced to its contradictory “policy framing,” which sent mixed messages about the purposes of the legislation.

In light of the federal government’s diminished role, Snow examines how other institutions have made policy in this emerging field. Snow finds provincial governments, medical organizations, and even courts have engaged in considerable policymaking, particularly with respect to surrogacy, parentage, and clinical intervention. The result—a complex field of overlapping and often conflicting policies—paints a fascinating portrait of different political actors and institutions working together. Accessibly written yet comprehensive in scope, Assisted Reproduction Policy in Canada highlights how paying attention to multiple policymakers can improve our knowledge of health care regulation.

Autonomous State,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442612976.jpg,"The Epic Struggle for a Canadian Car Industry from OPEC to Free Trade

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Anastakis, Dimitry

Autonomous State provides the first detailed examination of the Canadian auto industry, the country’s most important economic sector, in the post-war period. In this engrossing book, Dimitry Anastakis chronicles the industry’s evolution from the 1973 OPEC embargo to the 1989 Canada–US Free Trade Agreement and looks at its effects on public policy, diplomacy, business enterprise, workers, consumers, and firms.

Using an immense array of archival sources, and interviews with some of the key actors in the events, Anastakis examines a fascinating array of topics in recent auto industry and Canadian business and economic history: the impact of new safety, emissions, and fuel economy regulations on the Canadian sector and consumers, the first Chrysler bailout of 1980, the curious life and death of the 1965 Canada-US auto pact, the ‘invasion’ of Japanese imports and transplant operations, and the end of aggressive auto policy-making with the coming of free trade.

More than just an examination of the auto industry, the book provides a rethinking of Canada’s tumultuous post-OPEC political and economic evolution, helping to explain the current tribulations of the global auto sector and Canada’s place within it.

Biodiversity in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551112381.jpg,"Ecology, Ideas, and Action

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Stephen Bocking (CA)

Clearcut forests, endangered species, national parks, loss of crop varieties: in the last decade the common element of these varied concerns has become widely recognized. These are all biodiversity issues: they relate to the variety of life on Earth and our relationship with it. This relationship is now capturing the attention of activists, scientists, policymakers, and the public, from negotiations at the United Nations to concerns about the neighborhood park. Biodiversity issues raise many questions. How many species are there, and what do they need to survive? How have we learned what we know about biodiversity? What is its value? What policies are needed to protect it? Who participates in protecting biodiversity: governments, industry, activists? This book explores answers to these questions and, in doing so, shows how biodiversity, like other complex environmental issues, can only be understood through the insights provided by many perspecives. The authors contributing to this volume include scientists, historians, anthropologists, lawyers, political scientists, economists, and planners. Together, they provide an interdisciplinary perspective on biodiversity in Canada, especially usefol for undergraduate courses in environmental and natural resource studies, geography, and political science.

Blood on the Hills,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802009807.jpg,"The Canadian Army in the Korean War

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Bercuson, David Jay

The Korean War represented a series of firsts for Canadian soldiers - their first military action under UN auspices, their first under U.S. corps and army command, their first in Asia as ground troops, and their first in which people at home initially ignored their efforts, and then forgot about them. David Bercuson evokes the tastes and smells, the frustrations, the unfamiliar terrain, the international complexities, and the heroism that made the Korean War an unforgettable experience for those who fought there.Caught by surprise with only a phantom army, the Canadian government in the summer of 1950 was forced by its major allies to promise a ground combat contribution to the UN effort to push back the Communist invasion of South Korea from the north. The Canadian Army Special Force, as the Korean contingent was first called, was hurriedly raised, trained, and sent to Korea, ill-prepared for a mountain war against a determined, well-armed enemy. Canadian soldiers fought bravely, often against impossible odds, to carry out their mission, but they were hindered by several factors - cautious UN Command strategy, poor British and Canadian defence doctrine, uneven leadership, and inadequate equipment and training. They did their duty, and more, in stopping Communist aggression in its tracks, but the Canadian army chose not to remember the lessons of Korea, even though that conflict, as a limited war, set the pattern for virtually all those that followed.Blood on the Hills is the first full, non-official history of the Canadian army’s operations in the Korean War. The book covers the period from the start of that war to the cease-fire in July 1953 and describes and analyses the mobilization of the Canadian contingent, its training, manning, and equipment, and its efforts in combat. David Bercuson focuses on the many consequences of the army’s unreadiness for combat in Korea and on the army’s lack of success in learning lessons from its experience in an active theatre of war.

Boys and Girls in No Man’s Land,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442611238.jpg,"English-Canadian Children and the First World War

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Susan Fisher (CA)

Boys and Girls in No Man's Land examines how the First World War entered the lives and imaginations of Canadian children. Drawing on educational materials, textbooks, adventure tales, plays, and Sunday-school papers, this study explores the role of children in the nation's war effort.Susan R. Fisher also considers how the representation of the war has changed in Canadian children's literature. During the war, the conflict was invariably presented as noble and thrilling, but recent Canadian children's books paint a very different picture. What once was regarded a morally uplifting struggle, rich in lessons of service and sacrifice, is now presented as pointless slaughter. This shift in tone and content reveals profound changes in Canadian attitudes not only towards the First World War but also towards patriotism, duty, and the shaping of the moral citizen.

Breaking the Bargain,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085917.jpg,"Public Servants, Ministers, and Parliament

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Donald Savoie

Canada’s machinery of government is out of joint. In Breaking the Bargain, Donald J. Savoie reveals how the traditional deal struck between politicians and career officials that underpins the workings of our national political and administrative process is today being challenged. He argues that the role of bureaucracy within the Canadian political machine has never been properly defined, that the relationship between elected and permanent government officials is increasingly problematic, and that the public service cannot function if it is expected to be both independent of, and subordinate to, elected officials.While the public service attempts to define its own political sphere, the House of Commons is also in flux: the prime minister and his close advisors wield ever more power, and cabinet no longer occupies the policy ground to which it is entitled. Ministers, who have traditionally been able to develop their own roles, have increasingly lost their autonomy. Federal departmental structures are crumbling, giving way to a new model that eschews boundaries in favour of sharing policy and program space with outsiders. The implications of this functional shift are profound, having a deep impact on how public policies are struck, how government operates, and, ultimately, the capacity for accountability.

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Roger Martin (CA), James Milway (CA)

In this breathtaking coast-to-coast photographic panorama of Canada, Mike Grandmaison presents a portrait of a country whose seasons reflect the many moods of nature in all its glory. Whether it is the sight of an iceberg scudding the ocean along Newfoundlands coast, the ethereal autumn yellow expanse of prairie fields, or the melancholic beauty of a setting sun behind a mountain range, Grandmaisons photography captures the essence of a country where much of the wilderness remains untouched.Broadcaster Shelagh Rogers complements Grandmaisons work with an introduction that embraces Canada place which defies description.

Canada and the United States,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551117126.jpg,"Differences that Count, Third Edition

Editor: David Thomas, Barbara Boyle Torrey

This thoroughly revised edition of Canada and the United States: Differences that Count continues to address, in a timely way, key institutions and policy areas, adding new chapters on welfare, race and public policy, values, demography, crime, the environment, conflict resolution, and federalism. Data sources for further research have also been included. As in the previous editions, the book does not assume that differences are increasing or decreasing or that one country is ""better"" than the other. In a straightforward and readable manner, the book looks at the Canadian way and the American way of doing things. From health care to crime (and punishment); from immigration to race and public policy; from tax regulations to the environment; from values to prime ministers and presidents there are as many differences as there are similarities in the way the two countries do things, and not infrequently it turns out that the similarities and differences are not as we have assumed them to be. In Canada and the United States: Differences that Count, Third Edition, leading authorities compare and contrast the Canadian and the American experiences. They do so in the hope of creating a better understanding of the similarities and differences so that policy-makers, students, and ordinary citizens in each of the two countries may learn from the experiences of the other.

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Andrew Smith (CA), Andrew Ross (CA)

Molson. Redpath. Desjardins. Labatt. Massey. Eaton. These names are as much a part of our national identity as our hockey teams and our literature, but few of us know much about the people behind them - the individuals who have energized this country&apos;s economic life for over four centuries, and whose entrepreneurialism has shaped the face of Canadian business as we know it.This captivating collection of biographies profiles Canada&apos;s most prominent and innovative business people from the early 1600s through the first quarter of the twentieth century. Beginning with an accessible overview of the rise of entrepreneurialism in Canada, it features portraits of 61 individuals organized thematically. Here, readers will meet a variety of seminal characters: the merchants of the first trading posts and the commercial empire of the St. Lawrence; the industrialists of the Maritimes, Central Canada, and the West; the railway builders and urban developers; and everyone in between.Bringing to the fore new Dictionary of Canadian Biography research on the rise of Canadian entrepreneurialism - one of the least explored yet most important themes in our history - this book showcases Canada&apos;s long-running tradition of business innovation and growth.

Canada’s Navy,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802042811.jpg,"The First Century

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Milner, Marc

From its eighteenth-century roots in exploration and trade, to the major conflicts of the First and Second World Wars, through to current roles in multinational operations with United Nations and NATO forces, Canada's navy has been an expression of Canadian nationhood and a catalyst in the complex process of national unity.In Canada's Navy: The First Century, Marc Milner argues that the history of the Royal Canadian Navy falls into three distinct periods. Until 1939, the navy was essentially a national orphan - neglected by government, spurned by Canadians, composed largely of expatriate Britons, and lacking a clearly identifiable national role. The Second World War and the postwar years saw that role defined. During the war, the navy underwent an astonishing expansion that brought together Canadian industry, government, and people to produce the third largest navy in the world by 1945. That navy made a decisive contribution to winning the war in the Atlantic, and, with the outbreak of the Cold War, went on to confirm Canada's new and important role as part of a wider western alliance in the defence of shipping in the Atlantic. Since that time, naval history has been a struggle to reconcile naval ambitions for fleet development with those of the government, and to find a national identity for the service itself.The result has been the renaissance of the last two decades, which has seen the navy re-emerge from the wreckage of unification as an independent institution and with the fleet completely rebuilt. At the end of the century, the navy is the most modern and capable of Canada's armed services, and having discarded the imperial cloak of its early years, it is now identified with the nation it serves. Milner suggests that this remarkable metamorphosis may have been brought about by the coalescing of the visions of the navy, the nation, and the state. How long this will continue remains for the next century to determine.Based on extensive archival research and interviews, Canada's Navy: The First Century is a comprehensive examination, certain to provoke discussion, of a body with a rich and fascinating history. This book will appeal not only to readers of Canadian history and naval affairs, but also to those interested in the interwoven issues of maritime politics and economics, as well as national and foreign policy, and defence and strategic studies.

"Canadian Carnival Freaks and the Extraordinary Body, 1900-1970s",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487522087.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Jane Nicholas

In 1973, a five year old girl known as Pookie was exhibited as “The Monkey Girl” at the Canadian National Exhibition. Pookie was the last of a number of children exhibited as ‘freaks’ in twentieth-century Canada.

Jane Nicholas takes us on a search for answers about how and why the freak show persisted into the 1970s. In Canadian Carnival Freaks and the Extraordinary Body, 1900–1970s, Nicholas offers a sophisticated analysis of the place of the freak show in twentieth-century culture. Freak shows survived and thrived because of their flexible business model, government support, and by mobilizing cultural and medical ideas of the body and normalcy. This book is the first full length study of the freak show in Canada and is a significant contribution to our understanding of the history of Canadian popular culture, attitudes toward children, and the social construction of able-bodiness. Based on an impressive research foundation, the book will be of particular interest to anyone interested in the history of disability, the history of childhood, and the history of consumer culture.

Canadian Communication Thought,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802079497.jpg,"Ten Foundational Writers

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Robert Babe (CA)

Canada has a rich heritage of English-language communication thought. For the first time ""Canadian Communication Thought"" assembles much of this erudition by introducing and examining the writings of ten foundational scholars: Graham Spry, Harold Innis, John Grierson, Dallas Smythe, C.B. Macpherson, Irene Spry, George Grant, Gertrude Robinson, Northrop Frye, and Marshall McLuhan. The author compares and critiques the thought of these ten sages, relates their writings to their biographies and to the Canadian physical and cultural environment, and compares their work to foundational American communication scholars. He finds that there is indeed a mode of theorizing that is ‘quintessentially Canadian.’ Compared with the work of foundational American writers, for instance, the Canadian literature is significantly more dialectical, ontological, holistic, and critical; it emphasizes to a much greater extent the impact of communication on social change; and it is more concerned with mediation and the formation and sustenance of culture and community. The Canadian writers are also much more engaged than their American counterparts with the question of power in communication - with what can generally be regarded as matters of political economy.Moreover, the wisdom of these ten experts is invaluable for understanding important issues of our day, for example: globalization, environmental deterioration, rapid technological change in the communication sphere, the erosion of privacy, the diminution of public space, the commodification of information and culture, growing disparities between rich and poor, identity and representation in the media, virtual realities, and the waning of democracy. The communication thought of these ten acclaimed scholars increases awareness of questions we should continually ask, provides important insight into how we can resolve current dilemmas, and invites us to consider possibilities for pursuing freedom, equality, justice, and peace in the early twenty-first century.

Canadian Hockey Literature,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802097132.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Jason Blake

Hockey occupies a prominent place in the Canadian cultural lexicon, as evidenced by the wealth of hockey-centred stories and novels published within Canada. In this exciting new work, Jason Blake takes readers on a thematic journey through Canadian hockey literature, examining five common themes - nationhood, the hockey dream, violence, national identity, and family - as they appear in hockey fiction.Blake examines the work of such authors as Mordecai Richler, David Adams Richards, Paul Quarrington, and Richard B. Wright, arguing that a study of contemporary hockey fiction exposes a troubled relationship with the national sport. Rather than the storybook happy ending common in sports literature of previous generations, Blake finds that today's fiction portrays hockey as an often-glorified sport that in fact leads to broken lives and ironic outlooks. The first book to focus exclusively on hockey in print, Canadian Hockey Literature is an accessible work that challenges popular perceptions of a much-beloved national pastime.

Canadians and Their Pasts,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442615397.jpg,"The Pasts Collective

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Conrad, Margaret

What role does history play in contemporary society? Has the frenetic pace of today’s world led people to lose contact with the past? A high-profile team of researchers from across Canada sought to answer these questions by launching an ambitious investigation into how Canadians engage with history in their everyday lives. The results of their survey form the basis of this eye-opening book.

Canadians and Their Pasts reports on the findings of interviews with 3,419 Canadians from a variety of cultural and linguistic communities. Along with yielding rich qualitative data, the surveys generated revealing quantitative data that allows for comparisons based on gender, ethnicity, migration histories, region, age, income, and educational background. The book also brings Canada into international conversation with similar studies undertaken earlier in the United States, Australia, and Europe.

Canadians and Their Pasts confirms that, for most Canadians, the past is not dead. Rather, it reveals that our histories continue to shape the present in many powerful ways.

Cannabis,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802086303.jpg,"Report of the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs

Should the use of cannabis be decriminalized or legalized? If so, how should it be legislated, and for whom? Although Western nations have sought to address these questions for decades, there has never been a thorough and comprehensive study of the subject. A special committee of the Canadian senate sought to rectify this, and when their report was made public, it astonished observers with its audacious recommendations.Important scientific resources were used for the committee’s purposes: the investigations of 23 international researchers based on 200 interviews; the work of Canadian specialists working in an array of disciplines; and a large number of discussion groups. The essential recommendations of the report are found in this book. The Senate committee proposes new perspectives on illicit drugs, calling for a rational new political view that does not marginalize users. With innovative scientific investigation and bold recommendations, this report, prefaced by Senator Nolin, is an indispensable tool in the national and international debate surrounding cannabis.

Caring for Lesbian and Gay People,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802083791.jpg,"A Clinical Guide

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Allan D. Peterkin (CA), Cathy Risdon (CA)

What should you say if your patient is struggling with her sexuality? How do you respond to your married patient when he discloses to you his same-sex sexual history? To which medical studies do you turn when you need to know more about club drugs? As physicians and health professionals, you want to provide the best possible care for your patients, but medical schools and other health care teaching institutions do not generally provide comprehensive information on how to approach caring for sexual-minority patients. Allan D. Peterkin and Cathy Risdon have written Caring for Lesbian and Gay People ? the first medical guide to offer busy clinicians practical, accessible, and evidence-based information to help in the care of gay and lesbian patients.The authors begin with an overview of the history of medical relations with lesbian and gay patients, providing advice and guidelines for strengthening the doctor-patient relationship and raising the standard of care for all patients. The book then delves into a range of specific clinical issues, such as risk profiles for particular illnesses, screening for and managing sexually transmitted infections, and HIV in the primary care setting. Subsequent chapters cover such wide-ranging topics as mental health care and the effect of homophobia on relationships, same-sex parenting, the role that body image plays in health, and unique populations, such as lesbian and gay ethno-racial minorities, the transgendered, rural lesbian and gay people, and elders. Each chapter includes practical tips (advice on inclusive language, for example) and summaries, along with references, of written and online resources. Comprehensive and detailed, this work covers physical and mental health across the life cycle, with equal emphasis on women’s and men’s health.Based on more than twenty years of patient care and contributions to medical education and community development, this indispensable resource will greatly heighten the quality of care clinicians, health care practitioners, and educators can provide to their patients, and will in turn provide patients and consumers with the means to take an active role in their own health care.

Citizens and Nation,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802047090.jpg,"An Essay on History, Communication, and Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Gerald Friesen (CA)

Grandmother Andre told stories in front of a campfire. Elizabeth Goudie wrote a memoir in school scribblers. Phyllis Knight taped hours of interviews with her son. Today’s families rely on television and video cameras. They are all making history.In a different approach to that old issue, ‘the Canadian identity,’ Gerald Friesen links the media studies of Harold Innis to the social history of recent decades. The result is a framework for Canadian history as told by ordinary people. Friesen suggests that the common peoples’ perceptions of time and space in what is now Canada changed with innovations in the dominant means of communication. He defines four communication-based epochs in Canadian history: the oral-traditional world of pre-contact Aboriginal people; the textual-settler household of immigrants; the print-capitalism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and the screen-capitalism that has emerged in the last few decades. This analysis of communication is linked to distinctive political economies, each of which incorporates its predecessors in an increasingly complex social order.In each epoch, using the new communication technologies, people struggled to find the political means by which they could ensure that they and their households survived and, if they were lucky, prospered. Canada is the sum of their endeavours. ""Citizens and Nation"" demonstrates that it is possible to find meaning in the nation’s past that will interest, among others, a new, young, and multicultural reading audience.

Colour-Coded,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802082862.jpg,"A Legal History of Racism in Canada, 1900-1950

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Constance Backhouse (CA)

Historically Canadians have considered themselves to be more or less free of racial prejudice. Although this conception has been challenged in recent years, it has not been completely dispelled. In Colour-Coded, Constance Backhouse illustrates the tenacious hold that white supremacy had on our legal system in the first half of this century, and underscores the damaging legacy of inequality that continues today.Backhouse presents detailed narratives of six court cases, each giving evidence of blatant racism created and enforced through law. The cases focus on Aboriginal, Inuit, Chinese-Canadian, and African-Canadian individuals, taking us from the criminal prosecution of traditional Aboriginal dance to the trial of members of the ‘Ku Klux Klan of Kanada.’ From thousands of possibilities, Backhouse has selected studies that constitute central moments in the legal history of race in Canada. Her selection also considers a wide range of legal forums, including administrative rulings by municipal councils, criminal trials before police magistrates, and criminal and civil cases heard by the highest courts in the provinces and by the Supreme Court of Canada.The extensive and detailed documentation presented here leaves no doubt that the Canadian legal system played a dominant role in creating and preserving racial discrimination. A central message of this book is that racism is deeply embedded in Canadian history despite Canada’s reputation as a raceless society.Winner of the Joseph Brant Award, presented by the Ontario Historical Society

Comparative Federalism,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551114101.jpg,"A Systematic Inquiry

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Thomas Hueglin (CA), Alan Fenna

Comparative Federalism: A Systematic Inquiry is a uniquely comprehensive, analytic, genuinely comparative, and detailed introduction to the study of federalism in theory and practice. Thomas Hueglin and Alan Fenna draw from their diverse research on federal systems to argue that federalism is increasingly important for democratic governance and conflict management in a globalizing world. They discuss the meaning of federal principles and institutional compromise in the organization of federal systems and then introduce four main model federal systems: America, Canada, Germany, and the European Union. But they don’t stop there—they also offer an exploration of federal systems that vary from the four main models, including Switzerland, Australia, Belgium, South Africa, and Spain.
The book also compares federal systems through an examination of the differing European and North American traditions in the history of federal thought. Institutional features of federal systems are evaluated, as are the crucial role that constitutional amendment and judicial review play for the stability and evolutionary dynamic of federal systems. This book serves the dual role of helping the reader understand federalism and providing a comparative framework from which to assess the record of federal systems.

Conservatism in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442614567.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Farney, James Harold

With the electoral success of the Harper Conservatives federally and of a number of conservative parties provincially, the topic of Canadian conservatism is more important to our understanding of Canadian party politics than ever before. This timely volume presents the first comprehensive examination of Canadian conservatism in a generation – a period during which its nature has changed substantially.

Conservatism in Canada explores the ideological character of contemporary Canadian conservatism, its support in the electorate, its impact on public policies such as immigration and foreign policy, and its articulation at both federal and provincial levels. The essays include comparisons with other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, as well as specific examinations of conservatism in Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec.

Featuring contributions by both established and new scholars in the fields of political science and public policy, this volume makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the changing nature of Canadian conservatism and its broader implications for the future of this country.

Contemporary Antisemitism,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802039316.jpg,"Canada and the World

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Marrus, Michael R.

Editor: Michael R. Marrus (CA), Janice Gross Stein (CA), Derek J. Penslar (CA)

Antisemitism is reappearing in disturbing new ways and in unexpected strength. This resurgence is of deep concern to politicians, practitioners of law, the academic community, and to informed citizens everywhere. To address this, a scholarly conference was assembled at the University of Toronto in 2003. Contemporary Antisemitism is the result of that meeting.Editors Derek J. Penslar, Michael R. Marrus, and Janice Gross Stein, and the contributors to this volume address the following questions: is contemporary antisemitism an eerie echo of the past, or is it driven by new combinations of political, economic, and religious forces? How powerful are the anti-Jewish trends that so many have detected? And how should liberal democratic societies respond to this new threat against them? The essays map the terrain of antisemitic thought and practice, make important distinctions between expressions of antisemitism across time and space, and put various strategies of response into critical perspective.With its combination of voices from both scholarship and leadership ? including Chief Justice of Ontario R. Roy McMurtry and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and its unique assessment of antisemitism in Canada and the struggle against it, Contemporary Antisemitism offers new perspectives on one of the world’s most ancient and diffuse hatreds.

Contemporary Canadian Federalism,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802095336.jpg,"Foundations, Traditions, Institutions

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Alain-G. Gagnon (CA)

First published in French in 2006, Le fédéralisme canadien contemporain was immediately recognised as the most comprehensive collection of reflections on Canadian federalism by leading Québécois scholars. This remarkable translation of a range of Québécois voices makes their insightful and underrepresented perspectives available to English-language audiences.

Offering alternative views of the Canadian federal model’s realities by covering its foundations, traditions, and institutions, Contemporary Canadian Federalism considers the ways in which federalism relates to issues such as regionalism, multiculturalism, rights and freedoms, financial distribution, and public policy. Filled with stimulating work that bridges the gap between distinctive traditions in English- and French-Canadian scholarship on federalism, this important volume is required reading for understanding provincial-federal relations and Canadian governance.

Contesting Canadian Citizenship,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551113869.jpg,"Historical Readings

Editor: Dorothy Chunn (CA), Robert Menzies (CA), Robert Adamoski (CA)

Over the past 15 years, the citizenship debate in political and social theory has undergone an extraordinary renaissance. To date, much of the writing on citizenship, within and beyond Canada, has been oriented toward the development of theory, or has concentrated on contemporary issues and examples. This collection of essays adopts a different approach by contextualizing and historicizing the citizenship debate, through studies of various aspects of the rise of social citizenship in Canada. Focusing on the formative years from the late 19th through mid-20th century, contributors examine how emerging discourse and practices in diverse areas of Canadian social life created a widely engaged, but often deeply contested, vision of the new Canadian citizen. <EOL> <EOL>The original essays examine key developments in the fields of welfare, justice, health, childhood, family, immigration, education, labour, media, popular culture and recreation, highlighting the contradictory nature of Canadian citizenship. The implications of these projects for the daily lives of Canadians, their identities, and the forms of resistance that they mounted, are central themes. Contributing authors situate their historical accounts in both public and private domains, their analyses emphasizing the mutual permeability of state and civil(ian) life. These diverse investigations reveal that while Canadian citizenship conveys crucial images of identity, security, and participatory democracy within the ongoing project of nation building, it is also interlaced with the projects of a hierarchical social structure and exclusionary political order. This collection explores the origins and evolution of Canadian citizenship in historical context. It also introduces the more general dilemmas and debates in social history and political theory that inevitably inform these inquiries.

Court Government and the Collapse of Accountability in Canada and the United Kingdom,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802095794.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Donald Savoie

There is a consensus throughout much of the western world that the public sector is in urgent need of repair. This study seeks to understand why this is so by comparing developments in Canada and the United Kingdom. It looks to changes in values both in society and inside government, and to the relationships between politicians and civil servants at the top and between civil servants and citizens at the bottom.Donald J. Savoie argues that both Canada and the UK now operate under court government rather than cabinet government. By court government, he means that effective power now rests with their respective prime ministers and a small group of carefully selected courtiers. For things that matter to prime ministers and their courts, the decision-making process shifts from formal to informal, involving only a handful of actors. For things that matter less to them, the decision-making process is horizontal, cumbersome, and consultative, and involves a multitude of actors from different government departments and agencies as well as a variety of individuals operating outside government.Court governments undermine both the traditionally bureaucratic model and basic principles that have guided the development of our Westminster-Whitehall parliamentary system. Nonetheless, Canada and the United Kingdom still cling to accountability requirements better suited to the past and the traditional bureaucratic model. Savoie concludes with a call for new accountability requirements that correspond with court government as well as the new relationships between politicians and civil servants, and civil servants and citizens.

Crimes of Colour,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551113036.jpg,"Racialization and the Criminal Justice System in Canada

Editor: Kiran Mirchandani (CA), Wendy Chan (CA)

The original essays in Crimes of Colour explore the link between “race” and “crime” in the Canadian context. Much of the literature on race and crime to date has treated the category of “race” unproblematically; debate on this topic has focused primarily on the assumption that members of certain racial groups are most likely to commit crimes.In charting a different path, the authors in this collection provide critical and historical analyses of the connections between processes of “racialization” and “criminalization” in Canada.  The book seeks to engage the reader in thinking critically about how conceptualizations of racial identity and crime are interwoven. The editors begin by arguing for a need to shift from an analysis of “race” to an analysis of “racialization” in order to create the space for new ways of looking at the connections between race and crime. They investigate the history of the treatment of racialized people in Canada, looking at the processes through which First Nations people, immigrants, and people of colour have been defined in racialized terms and the way in which state policy has racialized individuals and groups. The insights provided by the historical backdrop situates the problematic legal positions First Nations people and people of colour occupied vis-a-vis the criminal justice system.Contemporary analyses of “race” and crime continue to highlight the on-going, complex, and subtle nature of the issues. Understanding how individuals are racialized in the legal system forms one of the main themes in this collection. Specifically, these discussions involve identifying the processes through which racialized groups and individuals are criminalized. The processes of racialization and criminalization come together in many contexts including various criminal justice institutions like the police and social institutions like the media.

Democratic Equality,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802083326.jpg,"What Went Wrong?

Editor: Edward Broadbent (CA)

Are the world’s oldest democracies failing? For most of the past fifty years democratic governments made determined and successful efforts at overcoming the significant inequalities that are the by-product of a capitalist economy. During this period a new concept of democratic citizenship that added social and economic rights to the liberal legacy of political and civil liberties established roots in most North Atlantic democracies. Since the 1980s this notion of democratic citizenship has been challenged ideologically to such a degree that through either major modification or complete elimination of programs, equality as a fundamental democratic goal is disappearing in many nations - particularly in the Anglo-American democracies.In this extraordinary collection, top scholars in political science, sociology, philosophy and economics, discuss this radical shift towards inequality in an age of mass capital globalization. Wide ranging in topic yet coherent in approach, Inequality and the Modern Democratic State comprises thirteen essays, including Ed Broadbent’s ""Ten Propositions about Equality and Democracy"", Robert Hackett’s ""Watch Dogs, Mad Dogs, or Lap Dogs?: News Media and Civic Equality"" and Barbara Ehrenreich’s ""Inequality in the Clinton Era"". Many European democracies, argue the contributors, have adapted to new circumstance in the global economy without resorting to policies that actively promote inequality. While differing in some important details on solutions, they all contend that the political decision-making process is of critical importance in entrenching, or battling, an escalating inequality that is neither necessary nor desirable.

Desiring Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442613911.jpg,"CBC Contests, Hockey Violence, and Other Stately Pleasures

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Cormack, Patricia

What do Tim Hortons, Hockey Night in Canada, and Rick Mercer have in common? Each is a popular symbol of Canadian identity, seen across the country – and beyond – on television and in other forms of media. But whose definition of ‘Canadian’ do they represent? What does it mean to be Canadian? Do we create our own impressions of Canadian identity, or are they created for us? In Desiring Canada, Patricia Cormack and James F. Cosgrave delve into these questions, exploring the connections between popular culture, media, and the Canadian state.

Taking as their examples the popular CBC contests, Tim Hortons advertising campaigns, NHL hockey violence, television comedy, and the business of gambling, this lively, engaging book investigates the relationship between some of our more beloved popular expressions of national identity and the extent to which the interests of the state appeal in various ways through the popular media to the pleasures of citizens, thus shaping our understanding of what it means to be Canadian.

Dictionary of Canadian Biography / Dictionnaire Biographique du Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802090874.jpg,"Volume XV, 1921-1930

Editor: Réal Bélanger, Ramsay Cook (CA)

This new volume of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography / Dictionnaire Biographique du Canada (DCB / DBC) presents well-written, carefully documented and meticulously edited biographies of Canadians from all walks of life. Its literary and scholarly standards make it, like its predecessors, the definitive biographical reference for its period of history. The 619 biographies by 446 authors present a panoramic view of the origins of modern Canada, its political landscapes, economic changes, educational institutions, cultural developments, and athletic achievements. The volume’s coverage is inclusive, ranging from murderers to artists, from business magnates to religious leaders, from Canada’s First Peoples to new immigrants. There are labour leaders, farmers, feminists, and naturalists as well as all the prominent leaders in all aspects of Canadian life.

The dominant theme of this volume is the emergence of a country engrossed by material gains and aware of broadening horizons. Sir Clifford Sifton, federal minister of the interior, Sir Lomer Gouin, premier of Quebec, and Sir Robert Bond, premier of Newfoundland, symbolize this age of development. The lives of Sir Adam Beck, father of Ontario Hydro, Gordon Morton McGregor, founder of the Ford Motor Company of Canada, and Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, illustrate how new technologies harnessed natural energy sources and created new ways to communicate. Such innovations drove the transformation of Canada in the early years of the twentieth century.An expanding nation required thousands of new people to answer the demands of the agricultural enterprises in the west, the manufacturing industries of central Canada, and the fishing and lumbering businesses of British Columbia and the Atlantic region.

Many newcomers were drawn from eastern Europe and Asia as well as the British Isles and western Europe, traditionally the homelands of new Canadians. The Doukhobor leader Peter Vasilevich Verigin, the housemaid Angelina Napolitano, the Chinese teacher and merchant Yip Sang, and the Orthodox clergyman Nestor Dmytriw all took their places in the increasingly complex ethnic mosaic.Social and economic changes inspired demands for other types of change. The movement of women into the professions is exemplified by the life of Clara Brett Martin, the first woman called to the bar in Canada. Jeanne Lajoie, an embattled Franco-Ontarian teacher, joins writers Sara Jeannette Duncan, Félicité Angers (known as Laure Conan), Joséphine Marchand (Dandurand) and Marjorie Lowry Christie Pickthall in the cast of women prominent in this volume. Among those representing arts and sports are the painter James Wilson Morrice and the brilliant goalkeeper Georges Vézina.

Dilemmas of Solidarity,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802094070.jpg,"Rethinking Distribution in the Canadian Federation

Editor: Jean-Francois Gaudreault-Desbiens (CA), Lorne Sossin (CA), Sujit Choudhry (CA)

Since the rise of the Canadian welfare state in the aftermath of the Second World War, the politics of social policy and fiscal federalism have been at the centre of federal-provincial relations. Recent events have given impetus for scholars to re-examine these issues. In 2002, the Quebec Commission on Fiscal Imbalance released its report, which introduced the term ‘vertical fiscal imbalance’ into the vocabulary of Canadian politics. Essentially, the commission determined that a disjunction between revenue-raising capacity and expenditures involving different orders of government – vertical fiscal imbalance – was an urgent problem that must be addressed. Dilemmas of Solidarity is both a reflection on and response to that finding.

Editors Sujit Choudhry, Jean-Francois Graudreault-Desbiens, and Lorne Sossin bring together an array of respected legal and political scholars to reflect on the Quebec Commission’s findings. The contributors to this volume illustrate how recent debates surrounding Canada’s equalization program suggest alternative ways to approach the issue. The goal of Dilemmas of Solidarity is to stand back from the particulars of different policy debates, to enable scholars to reflect on basic questions regarding redistribution. This fascinating collection will undoubtedly inform a more nuanced and wide-ranging debate both among academics and policy practitioners than has occurred in this past.

Do Men Mother?,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085467.jpg,"Fathering, Care, and Domestic Responsibility

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Andrea Doucet (CA)

More and more, fathers are deciding to stay at home and care for their children rather than work full-time outside of the home. More and more, Canadian families are lead by single fathers. Shining a spotlight on the lives of stay at home dads and single fathers, Do Men Mother? provides groundbreaking evidence of dramatic changes in mothering and fathering in Canada.

Using evidence gathered in a four-year in-depth qualitative study, including interviews with over 100 fathers – from truck drivers to insurance salesmen, physicians to artists – Andrea Doucet illustrates how men are breaking the mold of traditional parenting models. Doucet’s research examines key questions such as: What leads fathers to trade earning for caring? How do fathers navigate through the ‘maternal worlds’ of mothers and infants? Are men mothering or are they redefining fatherhood?

Do Men Mother? illuminates fathers’ candid reflections on caring and the intricate social worlds that men and women inhabit as they ‘love and let go’ of their children. In asking and unravelling the question ‘do men mother,’ this study tells a compelling story about Canadian parents radically re-visioning child care and domestic responsibilities at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

Downtown Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802087201.jpg,"Writing Canadian Cities

Editor: Douglas Ivison (CA), Justin D. Edwards (CA)

The vast majority of Canadians live in cities, yet for the most part, discussions of Canadian literature have failed to actively engage with the country’s urban experience. Canada’s prevalent myths continue to be about nordicity and the wilderness, and, stereotypically at least, its literature is often perceived as being about small towns, rural areas, and ‘roughing it in the bush.’ Downtown Canada is a collection of essays that addresses Canada as an urban place. The contributors focus their attention on the writing of Canada’s cities - including Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Halifax - and call attention to the centrality of the city in Canadian literature. They examine how characters are affected by the urban experience in works by a group of authors as diverse as the country itself: Hugh MacLennan, Jovette Marchessault, Michael Ondaatje, Austin Clarke, and Gerald Lynch, to name just a few. Editors Justin D. Edwards and Douglas Ivison have brought together an esteemed group of international Canadian literary scholars, and together they have created a book that is timely and unique, questioning conventional assumptions about Canadian literature, and Canadian culture more generally.

Dreams and Due Diligence,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442644854.jpg,"Till & McCulloch's Stem Cell Discovery and Legacy

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Joe Sornberger

In proving the existence of stem cells, Ernest Armstrong McCulloch and James Edgar Till formed the most important partnership in Canadian medical research since Frederick Banting and Charles Best, the discoverers of insulin. Together, Till and McCulloch instructed, influenced, and inspired successive generations of researchers who have used their findings to make huge advances against disease. Thousands of people who would have died from leukemia and immunological disorders now owe their lives to therapies developed from their discoveries.Despite their accomplishments, Till and McCulloch remain largely unknown, and until now, their story has remained untold. Dreams and Due Diligence vividly chronicles the work of two researchers who made medical history – two men who possessed exactly the right complementary talents to achieve greatness and win nearly every award available in medical research. Bringing their legacy to life for the first time, Joe Sornberger provides a dramatic account of the development of stem cell research, one of today's most ground-breaking medical scientific fields.

Dying from Improvement,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442628915.jpg,"Inquests and Inquiries into Indigenous Deaths in Custody

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Sherene H. Razack

“Dying from Improvement is a major contribution to the issues of Indigenous disposability, suffering, and struggles for justice within a settler state that is dedicated to their disappearance.” –Audra Simpson, Columbia University

In Dying from Improvement, Sherene H. Razack argues that, amidst systematic state violence against Indigenous people, inquiries and inquests serve to obscure the violence of ongoing settler colonialism under the guise of benevolent concern. Razack’s powerful critique of the Canadian settler state and its legal system speaks to many of today’s most pressing issues of social justice: the treatment of Indigenous people, the unparalleled authority of the police and the justice system, and their systematic inhumanity towards those whose lives they perceive as insignificant.

Earning and Caring in Canadian Families,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551111667.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Rod Beaujot (CA)

Most people place a high value on family, work, and children. However, there are often serious tensions associated with juggling and accommodating these priorities. This book analyses these tensions, working on the assumption that it is through the effective sharing of associated earning and caring activities that families are made and maintained.

The focus on the conflict between caring and earning highlights the basis on which the family activities of women and men are similar and different. Much writing on families tends to accentuate crisis and conflict. But a study of total time spent on productive activities (paid plus unpaid labour) actually shows there are not large differences between the time expended by women and men, although differences do lie in the division of this work. Furthermore, some couples maintain more symmetry which suggests there should be new social policies to promote ""new families"" based on a different accommodation for the sharing of provider and parenting roles. Indeed, the book especially considers the Swedish model where social policy effectively creates an incentive to postpone child-bearing until careers are established, the result being that the cost of child-rearing is partially transferred from women to men and to the workplace.

Clearly, family questions are complex. The division of family labour was central to the writings of early modern sociologists and family questions remain central to our understanding of social class, stratification, and inequality. In taking a detailed look at the abundant data and analyses available on families through the lens of the ""earning and caring equation,"" this book provides an excellent foundation for new understanding of the family. In so doing it alters our views on gender and inequality and offers new approaches to public policy and to human resource issues facing public and private organizations.

"Edible Histories, Cultural Politics",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442612839.jpg,"Towards a Canadian Food History

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Marlene Epp (CA), Franca Iacovetta (CA), Valerie J. Korinek (CA)

Just as the Canada&apos;s rich past resists any singular narrative, there is no such thing as a singular Canadian food tradition. This new book explores Canada's diverse food cultures and the varied relationships that Canadians have had historically with food practices in the context of community, region, nation and beyond.Based on findings from menus, cookbooks, government documents, advertisements, media sources, oral histories, memoirs, and archival collections, Edible Histories offers a veritable feast of original research on Canada's food history and its relationship to culture and politics. This exciting collection explores a wide variety of topics, including urban restaurant culture, ethnic cuisines, and the controversial history of margarine in Canada. It also covers a broad time-span, from early contact between European settlers and First Nations through the end of the twentieth century.Edible Histories intertwines information of Canada's 'foodways' – the practices and traditions associated with food and food preparation – and stories of immigration, politics, gender, economics, science, medicine and religion. Sophisticated, culturally sensitive, and accessible, Edible Histories will appeal to students, historians, and foodies alike.

Entries are cross-referenced and include tables, graphs, and suggestions for further reading. Several thematic essays are also included to illuminate the complex issues related to immigration, assimilation, multiculturalism, and Canadian culture and identity. This is a truly national encyclopedia that has taken almost a decade to produce and has involved over 300 scholars and researchers from all parts of Canada and abroad. Exacting standards for research, content, and the readability of entries have been strictly maintained by an advisory board of senior academics from a wide range of disciplines.The Encyclopedia of Canada’s Peoples is designed to excite all Canadians about their extraordinary past and the potential of their future.

"English Through Pictures, Books 1-3",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780887511172.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Christine M. Gibson, I. A. Richards

The three pocketbooks comprising the English Through Pictures series are the remarkable invention of I.A. Richards and Christine Gibson, who designed them to help the learner speak, read and write World English in the quickest and clearest possible way – through pictures.

The authors have made a careful selection of the most widely useful English words, choosing those with the power to define other words, and have put them to work in key patterns that offer the learner the ability to communicate successfully in World English. Book 1 contains a vocabulary of 250 such words, with an additional 500 developed in Book 2; these 750 words are then used in Book 3 to build a command of 1000 words which, by their defining power, hold the possibility of understanding as much as another 20,000 words of World English.

Throughout English Through Pictures, responsibility for learning is placed directly on the learner, who from the very start enjoys the ability to put essential words to work creating key sentence patterns where meaning is clearly shown in pictures. These simplified drawings allow learners to focus on the sentence and to enjoy growing confidence as they successfully take control of language, with the workbooks in Books 1 and 2 challenging and reinforcing their growing competence as both speakers and readers. Motivated and inspired, learners will soon find to their delight that fluent communication in World English – the common language of today’s world – lies well within their grasp.

English Through Pictures has already been used successfully alone or in combination with other English language programs by millions of learners in more than forty countries.

Federal-Provincial Diplomacy,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802094117.jpg,"The Making of Recent Policy in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Richard Simeon (CA)

Back in Print. Winner of the Martha Derthick Best Book Award from the Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations Section of the American Political Science Asscociation.Federal-provincial negotiation is a central feature of Canadian policy making, however much of this process takes place outside public view and goes unreported in the press. In Federal-ProvincialDiplomacy, Richard Simeon uncovers the mechanisms behind the policy negotiations taking place amongst Canada’s political leaders and bureaucrats. Simeon undertakes case studies exploring the creation of the Canadian and Quebec Pension Plan, the negotiations around financial and educational policies, and the early steps of putting together a new constitution. He then goes on to form a framework adapted from the literature of bargaining in international relations.First published in 1972 and reprinted in 1973, Federal-Provincial Diplomacy has become a classic of Canadian policy studies with an influence stretching far beyond Canada’s borders. Its importance was confirmed in 2005 when it was awarded the American Political Science Association’s prestigious Martha Derthick Award for the best book in federalism and intergovernmental relations published at least ten years earlier. Featuring a new afterword, Simeon’s work lives again for a new generation of policy analysts and students of federalism to enjoy and ponder.

"Federalism, Citizenship and Quebec",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802094483.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Raffaele Iacovino, Alain G. Gagnon (CA)

Canadians often imagine their country as a multicultural democracy, while a few go further to claim that the country’s diversity can be characterized as multinational in its social and institutional make-up. In Federalism, Citizenship, and Quebec, Alain-G. Gagnon and Raffaele Iacovino reveal how this notion has been falsely presented to the populace. Through comprehensive historical, contemporary, and critical accounts, they argue that the country has been the object of an aggressive nationalizing project that contravenes the principles of a ‘multinational federation.’ Gagnon and Iacovino defend a conception of diverse citizenship for Canada that is truly suitable to a durable and just constitutional association and provide an alternative path for the country based on normative, socio-political, and practical considerations associated with multinational democracy.Including a detailed account of the main challenges associated with Quebec’s place in the federation, Federalism, Citizenship, and Quebec stands apart from other English-language studies on multinational democracy, citizenship, and federalism, and, most notably, multinational democracy in Canada. Gagnon and Iacovino ground their work in both history and theory, offering a truly interdisciplinary approach that will appeal to scholars from fields as diverse as Canadian and Quebec politics, comparative politics, and political and legal theory. The book will contribute to awareness of the need for appreciating diversity in contemporary societies while being a useful addition to English Canadian students in these fields, who often lack exposure to many of the rich debates proceeding in Quebec.

Fields of Fire,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802037305.jpg,"The Canadians in Normandy

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Copp, Terry

Fields of Fire offers a stunning reversal of accepted military history. Terry Copp challenges and refutes the conventional view that the Canadian contribution to the Battle of Normandy was a ‘failure’: that the allies won only through the use of ‘brute force,’ and that the Canadian soldiers and commanding officers were essentially incompetent. His detailed and impeccably researched analysis of what actually happened on the battlefield portrays a flexible, innovative army that made a major, and successful, contribution to the defeat of the German forces in just seventy-six days.Challenging both existing interpretations of the campaign and current approaches to military history, Copp examines the Battle of Normandy, tracking the soldiers over the battlefield terrain and providing an account of each operation carried out by the Canadian army to illustrate the valour, skill, and commitment of the Allied citizen-soldier in the face of a well-entrenched and well-equipped enemy army. Using signal message logs, war diaries, operational research reports, and interviews, Copp re-examines often overlooked battles such as the advance inland on D-Day and the defence of the bridgehead, as well as the frequently analyzed struggle for Verrières ridge and the operations to reach Falaise, placing each operation within the context of overall Allied strategy. He demonstrates that previous accounts exaggerated the prowess of the German army and that while Allied air power and numerical strength were important, the Canadian and other Allied citizen armies won the war on the battlefield by employing an effective doctrine. The Canadian contribution to the Battle of Normandy, Copp argues, was an extraordinary achievement, well out of proportion to the number of troops engaged in battle, and the army was far more successful than previous historians have claimed. Passionately written and compellingly argued, Fields of Fire will make an irrefutable and controversial mark on Canadian military history.

First Peoples of Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442626126.jpg,"Masterworks from the Canadian Museum of Civilization

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Pilon, Jean-Luc

First Peoples of Canada offers readers a rare opportunity to experience a celebrated exhibition that has toured the world, yet has never been shown in Canada. This beautifully designed, full-colour book presents a collection of 150 archaeological and ethnographic objects produced by Canada’s First Peoples – including some that are roughly 12,000 years old – that represent spectacular expressions of creativity and ingenuity.

Curators Jean-Luc Pilon and Nicholette Prince sought out pieces held by the Canadian Museum of Civilization that could be considered “masterworks” based on their aesthetic qualities, symbolic value, or the skills and raw materials used in manufacturing them. These unique and priceless artifacts embody the rich diversity of skills and materials used by Canadian Inuit, First Nations, and Métis in both ancient and modern times.

First Peoples of Canada is full of insights not only on the pieces themselves, but also on the cultures that produced them and the geography of this vast land. Readers will come away from this book with a renewed appreciation of the lifestyles and achievements of Canada’s original inhabitants.

This collection focuses on items made by people in four regions across Canada: the farmers of the Great Lakes, the hunters and warriors of the Great Plains, the wealthy Salmon People of costal British Columbia, and the people of Canada’s harshest environments, the Arctic and Boreal Forest.

Four Days in Hitler’s Germany is a clearly written and engaging story that addresses how King truly believed that any threat to peace would come only from those individuals who intended to thwart the Nazi agenda, which as King saw it, was concerned primarily with justifiable German territorial and diplomatic readjustments. Mackenzie King was certainly not alone in misreading the omens in the 1930s, but it would be difficult to find a democratic leader who missed the mark by a wider margin.

From Bureaucracy to Public Management,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551112718.jpg,"The Administrative Culture of the Government of Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: James Iain Gow (CA), O.P. Dwivedi (CA)

This book is about the systems of values, traditions, perceptions, and meanings existing in the Canadian federal public service since the First World War. Surveying that history, it considers the conflict of values arising from the attempt to add New Public Management values to older bureaucratic ones. These tensions are looked at from an ethical viewpoint, but also from that of the relationship between ends and means. Are the means proposed really likely to meet the ends proclaimed? Attempts to change a culture from the top down run against daily realities; the interests, training, and experience of all employees, elites, and others. Authors Dwivedi and Gow intend this overview to enable readers to appreciate the complex world of Canada’s public servants.

From New Peoples to New Nations is a broad historical account of the emergence of the Metis as distinct peoples in North America over the last three hundred years. Examining the cultural, economic, and political strategies through which communities define their boundaries, Gerhard J. Ens and Joe Sawchuk trace the invention and reinvention of Metis identity from the late eighteenth century to the present day. Their work updates, rethinks, and integrates the many disparate aspects of Metis historiography, providing the first comprehensive narrative of Metis identity in more than fifty years.

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Nicole Neatby

Tourism promoters strive to brand their destinations in anticipation of what they think travellers hope to experience. In turn, travel writers react in part to destinations in line with their expectations. While several scholars have documented such patterns elsewhere, these have remained understudied in the case of Quebec despite the frequency with which the province was branded and rebranded and its status as a major North American travel destination in the decades leading up to Expo 67. The first comprehensive history of Quebec tourism promotion and travel writing, From Old Quebec to La Belle Province details changing marketing strategies and shows how these efforts consistently mirrored and strengthened French Quebec’s evolving national identity. Nicole Neatby also takes into account the contentious role of English-speaking promoters in Montreal, belying the view that Quebec was unvaryingly represented and appreciated for being “old.” Taking a comparative approach, Neatby draws on books and a wide array of newspapers, popular and specialized magazines, and written and visual sources from outside the tourist genre to reveal how the distinct national and cultural identities of English Canadians, Americans, and French Quebecers profoundly shaped their expectations and reactions to the province. From Old Quebec to La Belle Province traces and explains shifting promotional priorities for tourism and travel writers’ varying reactions over the course of four decades, and how these attitudes harmonized with evolving national identities.

From Wall Street to Bay Street,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442616257.jpg,"The Origins and Evolution of American and Canadian Finance

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Joe Martin

The 2008 financial crisis rippled across the globe and triggered a worldwide recession. Unlike the American banking system which experienced massive losses, takeovers, and taxpayer funded bailouts, Canada’s banking system withstood the crisis relatively well and maintained its liquidity and profitability. The divergence in the two banking systems can be traced to their distinct institutional and political histories.

From Wall Street to Bay Street is the first book for a lay audience to tackle the similarities and differences between the financial systems of Canada and the United States. Christopher Kobrak and Joe Martin reveal the different paths each system has taken since the early nineteenth-century, despite the fact that they both originate from the British system. The authors trace the roots of each country’s financial systems back to Alexander Hamilton and insightfully argue that while Canada has preserved a Hamiltonian financial tradition, the United States has favoured the populist Jacksonian tradition since the 1830s. The sporadic and inconsistent fashion in which the American system have changed over time is at odds with the evolutionary path taken by the Canadian system. From Wall Street to Bay Street offers a timely and accessible comparison of financial systems that reflects the political and cultural milieus of two of the world’s top ten economies.

Gabriel Dumont,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551115757.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Estate of George Woodcock (CA)

Editor: J.R. Miller (CA)

The struggle of the Métis of the Saskatchewan River against the government of Canada culminated in the Riel Rebellion of 1885—an event of central importance in shaping almost all of the key polarities of Canadian history. If Riel provided the intellectual inspiration for the Rebellion, it was Gabriel Dumont who provided its strategy, and arguably its soul. Dumont, a leading figure in the Métis society of hunters along the South Saskatchewan, had been president of the short-lived local government, and became ""Adjutant General of the Métis people"" when a Provisional Government was declared in 1885. After the defeat of the Rebellion by the Canadian militia Dumont lived for several years in the United States, and was for some time a performer in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. In his last years he returned to his old home near Batoche (site of the final defeat of the Métis forces in 1885), where he died in 1906.

George Woodcock’s biography of Dumont displays the author’s remarkable gift for evocative narration and description. In the wake of its 1975 publication Canadians had a new reference point in the way they thought of the Riel Rebellion; alongside the spirituality and impulsiveness of Riel was the calm commitment of Dumont, whose intuitive feel for the land and for the moods of his people have now become part of the Canadian historical imagination.

For this re-issue of Woodcock’s classic biography noted historian J.R. Miller has written a substantial introduction setting Gabriel Dumont in the context of Canadian history as we now understand it, in the context of Canadian historiography, and in the context of Woodcock’s other work. As Miller convincingly argues, the biography is richly deserving of a lasting place in Canada’s historical literature.

Gendering the Nation,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802079640.jpg,"Canadian Women's Cinema

Editor: Kay Armatage (CA), Brenda Longfellow (CA), Kass Banning (CA)

Since Nell Shipman wrote and starred in Back to God’s Country (1919), Canadian women have been making films. The accolades given to film-makers such as Patricia Rozema (I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing, When Night is Falling), Alanis Obomsawin (My Name Is Kahenttiiosta, Walker), and Micheline Lanctot (Deux Actrices) at festivals throughout the world in recent years attest to the growing international recognition for films made by Canadian women. With Gendering the Nation the editors have produced a definitive collection of essays, both original and previously published, that address the impact and influence of a century of women’s film-making in Canada. In dialogue with new paradigms for understanding the relationship of cinema with nation and gender, Gendering the Nation seeks to situate women’s cinema through the complex optic of national culture. This collection of critical essays employs a variety of frameworks to analyse cinematic practices that range from narrative to documentary to the avant garde.

Globalization Unplugged,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802038555.jpg,"Sovereignty and the Canadian State in the Twenty-First Century

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Urmetzer, Peter

The debate over economic globalization has reached a fever pitch in the past decade and a half with Western governments and multinational corporations trumpeting its virtues and a multitude of activists and developing-world citizens vociferously denouncing it. Both sides would agree that globalization is a recent development that is changing the way people and nations do business, but in Globalization Unplugged, Peter Urmetzer questions whether national economies are losing their sovereignty and whether the topic of globalization merits as much discussion as it receives.Urmetzer’s focus is specifically on Canada and he demonstrates that current levels of trade are not unprecedented and, further, that as the economy becomes more service oriented, it will also become less trade dependent. He points out that only a relatively small percentage of Canada’s wealth is owned by foreign investors and likewise, only a small portion of the country’s wealth is located outside of its borders.Disputing claims that the nation-state is weakening or disappearing altogether, Urmetzer shows how the welfare-state side of government spending - conveniently ignored in the anti-globalization literature yet arguably the most significant development in the political economy of the nation-state in the twentieth century - remains remarkable stable. Written with precision and skill, Globalization Unplugged will spark controversy on both sides of the globalization debate and help deflate the rhetoric of both advocates and detractors.

Guardian of  the  Gulf,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802044921.jpg,"Sydney, Cape Breton, and the Atlantic Wars

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Brian Tennyson (CA), Roger Sarty (CA)

One of the great untold Canadian military stories revolves around the eastern seaport of Sydney, Nova Scotia. Guardian of the Gulf offers a vivid and long overdue account of Sydney harbour’s role, and the importance of its coal deposits, in North Atlantic strategy and military operations from the Anglo-French wars in the eighteenth century to the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.More than two centuries of activity in and around Sydney harbour came to a head during the world wars, when Sydney became a major convoy port in the merchant-ship lifeline that sustained Britain with supplies from North America. Essential to the air and naval forces that pursued German submarines in the waters off the coast of Canada, Sydney was also an imporatant industrial centre that produced enormous quantities of critically important coal and steel. Exploring the roles of army, navy, air force, and merchant marine, Tennyson and Sarty offer richly detailed information on garrisons, fortifications, base development, and maritime warfare.Set against the Backdrop of national and alliance policymaking in London, Ottawa, and Washington, the story moves deftly between the larger and smaller pictures, making this a work of both colourful immediacy and broad interpretation.Winner of the 2000 Keith Matthews Award for Best Book, awarded by Canadian Nautical Research Society

Health Care in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442609839.jpg,"A Citizen's Guide to Policy and Politics

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Katherine Fierlbeck (CA)

Health Care in Canada examines the challenges faced by the Canadian health care system, a subject of much public debate. In this book Katherine Fierlbeck provides an in-depth discussion of how health care decisions are shaped by politics and why there is so much disagreement over how to fix the system.Many Canadians point to health care as a source of national pride; others are highly critical of the system's shortcomings and call for major reform. Yet meaningful debate cannot occur without an understanding of how the system actually operates. In this overview, Fierlbeck outlines the basic framework of the health care system with reference to specific areas such as administration and governance, public health, human resources, drugs and drug policy, and mental health. She also discusses alternative models in other countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. As health care becomes increasingly complex, it is crucial that Canadians have a solid grasp of the main issues within both the policy and political environments. With its balanced and accessible assessment of the main political and theoretical debates, Health Care in Canada is an essential guide for anyone with a stake in Canada's health system.

Hidden in Plain Sight,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085818.jpg,"Contributions of Aboriginal Peoples to Canadian Identity and Culture, Volume 1

Editor: David Newhouse (CA), Dan Beavon (CA), Cora J. Voyageur (CA)

The history of Aboriginal people in Canada taught in schools and depicted in the media tends to focus on Aboriginal displacement from native lands and the consequent social and cultural disruptions they have endured. Collectively, they are portrayed as passive victims of European colonization and government policy, and, even when well intentioned, these depictions are demeaning and do little to truly represent the role Aboriginal peoples have played in Canadian life. Hidden in Plain Sight adds another dimension to the story, showing the extraordinary contributions Aboriginal peoples have made – and continue to make – to the Canadian experience.From treaties to contemporary arts and literatures, Aboriginal peoples have helped to define Canada and have worked to secure a place of their own making in Canadian culture. For this volume, editors David R. Newhouse, Cora J. Voyageur, and Daniel J.K. Beavon have brought together leading scholars and other impassioned voices, and together, they give full treatment to the Aboriginal contribution to Canada’s intellectual, political, economic, social, historic, and cultural landscapes. Included are profiles of several leading figures such as actor Chief Dan George, artist Norval Morrisseau, author Tomson Highway, activist Anna Mae Pictou Aquash, and politician Phil Fontaine, among others. Canada simply would not be what it is today without these contributions. The first of two volumes, Hidden in Plain Sight is key to understanding and appreciating Canadian society and will be essential reading for generations to come.

History of the Book in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802080127.jpg,"Volume 2: 1840-1918

Editor: Patricia Lockhart Fleming (CA), Fiona Black (CA), Yvan Lamonde (CA)

Vast in its scope and depth of scholarship, this second volume of the History of the Book in Canada extends the landmark research on Canadian book and print culture from 1840 to the end of the First World War. During this time, the lives of Canadians were shaped by technological innovation, political change, and settlement of the West by immigrants from Europe and migrants from eastern and central Canada and the United States. The development of steam power, telegraphy, photography, electricity, and the railroads transformed the book trades.Whether it was an urban daily, a small-town weekly, a newspaper published in one of a dozen languages, or a magazine, the periodical press reached readers across the country. The period also saw Canadian authors such as L.M. Montgomery write bestsellers that are still popular today, and marked the introduction of new voices, including those of Black communities, Native peoples, and the Métis led by Louis Riel, into print.Traditional genres of print – government publications, religious books, almanacs, and schoolbooks – were joined in the mid to late nineteenth century by new forms, such as department store catalogues. Advances in Canada’s postal service carried print to a wider audience. Unchallenged by other media until the 1890s, print retained a central role in Canadian society into the new century and remained a key source of information and propaganda during the war years. This second of three volumes in theHistory of the Book in Canada demonstrates the same research and editorial standards established with Volume One by book history specialists from across the nation. The fascinating story of print in the lives of Canadians continues in this significant contribution to Canada’s cultural heritage.Les Presses de l’Université de Montréal is simultaneously publishing French-language editions of each volume as Histoire du livre et de l’imprimé au Canada. Cet ouvrage est également disponible en langue française aux Presses de l’Université de Montréal.

"Hockey, PQ",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442616196.jpg,"Canada's Game in Quebec's Popular Culture

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Amy J. Ransom

A wide-ranging study that examines everything from the blockbuster movie franchise Les Boys to the sovereigntist hip hop group Loco Locass, Hockey, PQ explores how Canada’s national sport has been used to signify a specific Québécois identity. Amy J. Ransom analyzes how Québécois writers, filmmakers, and musicians have appropriated symbols like the Montreal Forum, Maurice Richard, or the 1972 Summit Series to construct or critique images of the Québécois male. Close analyses of hockey-themed narratives consider the soap opera Lance et compte (‘He shoots, he scores’), the music of former pro player Bob Bisonnette, folk band Mes Aïeux, rock group Les Dales Hawerchuk, and the fiction of François Barcelo. Through these examinations of the role hockey plays in contemporary francophone popular culture, Ransom shows how Quebec’s popular culture uses hockey to distinguish French-Canadians from the French and to rally them against their English-speaking counterparts. In the end, however, this study illuminates how the sport of hockey unites the two solitudes.

How Theatre Educates,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802087508.jpg,"Convergences and Counterpoints with Artists, Scholars, and Advocates

Editor: David Booth (CA), Kathleen Gallagher (CA)

Canada boasts a remarkable number of talented theatre artists, scholars, and educators. How Theatre Educates brings together essays and other contributions from members of these diverse communities to advocate for a broader and more inclusive understanding of theatre as an educative force.Organized to reflect the variety of contexts in which professionals are making, researching, and teaching drama, this anthology presents a wide range of articles, essays, reminiscences, songs, poems, plays, and interviews to elucidate the relationship between theatre practice and pedagogy, and to highlight the overriding theme: namely, that keeping ‘education’ – with its curriculum components of dramatic literature and theatre studies in formal school settings – separate from ‘theatre’ outside of the classroom, greatly diminishes both enterprises.In this volume, award-winning playwrights, directors, actors, and scholars reflect on the many ways in which those working in theatre studios, school classrooms, and on stages throughout the country are engaged in teaching and learning processes that are particular to the arts and especially genres of theatre. Situating theatre practitioners as actors in a larger socio-cultural enterprise, How Theatre Educates is a fascinating and lively inquiry into pedagogy and practice that will be relevant to teachers and students of drama, educators, artists working in theatre, and the theatre-going public.Contributors

Hunting the 1918 Flu,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802087485.jpg,"One Scientist's Search for a Killer Virus

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Kirsty E. Duncan (CA)

In 1918, medical science was at a loss to explain the Spanish flu epidemic, which swept the world in three great waves and killed an estimated 20 to 40 million people in just one year, more than the number that died during the four years of World War I. Today, while the Spanish flu has faded in the public’s memory, most virologists are convinced that sooner or later a similarly deadly flu virus will return with a vengeance.Responding to this sustained interest in the Spanish flu, Kirsty Duncan in Hunting the 1918 Flu presents a detailed account of her experiences as she organized a multi-national, multi-discipline scientific expedition to exhume the bodies of a group of Norwegian miners, buried in Svalbard, all of whom died from the Spanish flu virus. Duncan weaves a twofold narrative: first, the story of a large-scale medical project with the objective of uncovering genetic material from the Spanish flu and second, a first-hand account of the turbulent politics that emerged as the group moved towards a goal where the egos were as strong as the stakes were high. Duncan, herself not an epidemiologist but a physical geographer, is very frank about her bruising emotional, financial, and professional experience on the ‘dark side of science.’ Readers witness how the research team engages in ‘entropic’ behaviour, despite its presumed dedication to science and the search for the virus, as the compelling story unfolds through the beginning progress and harrowing conclusion of her project (1992-2001).In her account of pursuing the deadly killer, Kirsty Duncan raises questions not only regarding public health, epidemiology, ethics of science, and the rights of subjects but also about age, gender, and privilege in science. While her search for the virus has shown promising preliminary results, it has also shown the dangers of science itself being subsumed in the rush for personal acclaim.

In the Days of Our Grandmothers,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802079602.jpg,"A Reader in Aboriginal Women's History in Canada

Editor: Lorna Townsend (CA), Mary-Ellen Kelm (CA)

From Ellen Gabriel to Tantoo Cardinal, many of the faces of Aboriginal people in the media today are women. In the Days of Our Grandmothers is a collection of essays detailing how Aboriginal women have found their voice in Canadian society over the past three centuries. Collected in one volume for the first time, these essays critically situate Aboriginal women in the fur trade, missions, labour and the economy, the law, sexuality, and the politics of representation.Leading scholars in their fields demonstrate important methodologies and interpretations that have advanced the fields of Aboriginal history, women’s history, and Canadian history. A scholarly introduction lays the groundwork for understanding how Aboriginal women’s history has been researched and written and a comprehensive bibliography leads readers in new directions. In the Days of our Grandmothers is essential reading for students and anyone interested in Aboriginal history in Canada.

In the Words of Elders,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802079534.jpg,"Aboriginal Cultures in Transition

Editor: Don McCaskill (CA), Peter Kulchyski (CA), David Newhouse (CA)

Over years of teaching, it became increasingly apparent to the editors of this book (the Aboriginal Education Council at Trent University) that students in their Native Studies classes were dissatisfied with many of the texts they were assigned, which were usually anthropological in nature. Their response was to propose a new text that would provide an overview of the thought-worlds of Aboriginal cultures from the inside.Bringing together the voices of sixteen Elders and traditional teachers from across Canada, this collection allows readers to compare the vision and experience of a generation of Aboriginal people. Today, Elders are the historians of the Aboriginal past and the keepers of cultural events and ceremonies. They are teachers, healers, and experts in survival, sharing a world view based on the knowledge that all things in life are related and are governed by natural laws. Those represented here include men and women from a variety of traditions and geographical locations. This unique collection sets a new standard for the representation of First Nations cultures in the academic context. Not only does it mark a shift in the production of knowledge, it fulfils a need for a closer and more respectful collaboration between Native and non-Native communities.

Indigenous Difference and the Constitution of Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802080493.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Patrick Macklem (CA)

There is a unique constitutional relationship between Aboriginal people and the Canadian state - a relationship that does not exist between other Canadians and the state. It’s from this central premise that Patrick Macklem builds his argument in this outstanding and significant work.Why does this special relationship exist? What does it entail in terms of Canadian constitutional order? There are, Macklem argues, four complex social facts that lie at the heart of the relationship. First, Aboriginal people belong to distinctive cultures that were and continue to be threatened by non-Aboriginal beliefs, philosophies, and ways of life. Second, prior to European contact, Aboriginal people lived in and occupied North America. Third, prior to European contact, Aboriginal people not only occupied North America; they exercised sovereign authority over persons and territory. Fourth, Aboriginal people participated in and continue to participate in a treaty process with the Crown. Together, these four social conditions are exclusive to the Aboriginal people of North America and constitute what Macklem refers to as indigenous difference.Exploring the constitutional significance of indigenous difference in light of the challenges it poses to the ideal of equal citizenship, Macklem engages an interdisciplinary methodology that treats constitutional law as an enterprise that actively distributes power, primarily in the form of rights and jurisdiction, among a variety of legal actors, including individuals, groups, institutions, and governments. On this account, constitutional law refers to an ongoing project of aspiring to distributive justice, disciplined but not determined by text, structure, or precedent. Far from threatening equality, constitutional protection of indigenous difference promotes equal and therefore just distributions of constitutional power.The book details constitutional rights to Aboriginal people that protect interests associated with culture, territory, sovereignty, and the treaty process, and explores the circumstances in which these rights can be interfered with by the Canadian state. It also examines the relation between these rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Feedoms, and proposes extensive reform of existing treaty processes in order to protect and promote their exercise.Macklem’s book offers a challenge to traditional understandings of the constitutional status of indigenous peoples, relevant not only to Canadian debates but also to those in other parts of the world where indigenous peoples are asserting greater autonomy over their collective futures.

In Interculturalism, sociologist and historian Gérard Bouchard presents his vision of interculturalism as a model for the management of diversity. A pluralist approach which recognizes the existence of a cultural majority whose rights must also be acknowledged, interculturalism constitutes an important alternative to multiculturalism both in Canada and internationally. Written by one of Québec’s leading public intellectuals and the co-chair of the Bouchard-Taylor Commission on reasonable accommodation, Interculturalism is the first clear and comprehensive statement in English of an approach being discussed around the world.

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Lecker, Robert

Keepers of the Code explores the complex network of associations and negotiations that influenced the development of literary anthologies in English Canada from 1837 to the present. Lecker shows that these anthologies are deeply conflicted narratives that embody the tensions and anxieties felt by their editors when faced with the challenge of constructing or rejecting national ideals. He argues that these are intensely self-conscious works with their own literary mechanisms and architecture. In reading the history of these anthologies, he witnesses a complex narrative of nation, a compelling story about the values and interests informing English-Canadian literary history.

L.M. Montgomery and Canadian Culture,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802044068.jpg,"Editor: Elizabeth Rollins Epperly, Irene Gammel

Despite the enormous popularity of her books, particularly Anne of Green Gables, L.M. Montgomery’s role in the development of Canada’s national culture is not often discussed by literary historians. This is curious as some of Canada’s leading writers, including Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, and Jane Urquhart, have acknowledged their indebtedness to Montgomery’s fiction. That scholars have not mined the ‘Canadianness’ of Montgomery’s writing is redressed by this collection. It is the first systematic effort to investigate and explore Montgomery’s active engagement with Canadian nationalism and identity, including regionalism, canon formation, and Canadian-American cultural relations. It examines her work in relation to the many dramatic changes of her day, such as the women’s movement and the advent of new technologies; and it looks at the national and international consumption of Anne of Green Gables, in the form of both ‘high’ culture and cultural tourism.The wide range of contributors represent views from across disciplines and boundaries, including feminist, biographical, psychoanalytical, historical, and cultural approaches. The scholarly reflections are punctuated to great effect by creative pieces, personal reflections, and interviews. This ground-breaking collection will appeal to all fans of Montgomery’s work and to students of Canadian letters. It places Montgomery and her work squarely in the mainstream of Canadian literary history, affirming her importance to our country’s cultural development.

Last Enemy (the)- Commemorative Ed.,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780887511035.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Richard Hillary

Described by critics as “not a book written by a pilot about the war, but a book written by a writer about a pilot”, The Last Enemy tells the story of a young writer’s experiences as a Spitfire pilot in training and during the Battle of Britain, and of the life he led after being shot down.

Richard Hillary begins his story with a gripping account of his flight from Hornchurch on September 3, 1940, up and out over the Channel and into ferocious aerial combat, “a blur of twisting machines and tracer bullets”. His plane hit and hurtling towards the water, Richard bails out of the flaming cockpit and parachutes into the Channel where, hours later, he is eventually rescued by the Margate lifeboat.

The Last Enemy then tells the extraordinary and moving story surrounding that September day. It describes carefree days at Trinity College, Oxford, light-hearted competitive rowing in Germany and Hungary, training as a fighter pilot, aerial combat and then, after being shot down and cruelly burnt by the flames, of a slow and painful recovery. Richard tells also of great friendship and of tragic loss and – in yet more sombre tones – of intense and agonizing personal reflection and questioning about his own war experience, which transformed him from a gifted and handsome athlete, admired and envied by his contemporaries, into a ravaged figure. Unsure of whether or not he would ever be passed fit enough to fly again, Richard asks himself what he can do for those who have died? As he himself wrote: “Then after a while it came to me. I could write.” And so he came to write The Last Enemy.

This commemorative edition of The Last Enemy, with a foreword by D.M.W. to whom the book was originally dedicated, is being published on April 20, Richard Hillary’s birthday, and in 2003, sixty years after his death.

Leacock on Life,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802035943.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Estate of Stephen Leacock

Editor: Gerald Lynch (CA)

Canadian cultural icon Stephen Leacock was as wise and witty as he was prolific, and as sharp as he was humane. A professor of political economy, author, and social critic, Leacock has long been considered Canada’s foremost humourist and social satirist. He was at his best in observational humour but excelled as well in the unforgettable aphorism and the pointed riposte. Leacock’s views on life provide a uniquely Canadian take on the world, an ironic perspective which continues to delight and instruct readers around the globe.Introduced and compiled by scholar and writer Gerald Lynch, with material gleaned from the approximately sixty books of fiction and non-fiction Leacock published, Leacock on Life is an anthology of Leacock’s wit and wisdom, beginning with his memorable preface to Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town and ending with his bitter-sweet essay, ‘Three Score and Ten.’ With selections classified under forty-five headings and a reference key sourcing all quotations, this collection makes widely available Leacock’s views on such subjects as: Canadian politics, love, education, economics, humour, technology, business, America, and writing, among many others. Leacock had opinions on every subject, and they are as humorous, provocative, and relevant today as when first articulated.

Lloyd Axworthy, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, rose to international prominence in the mid-1990s for his comprehensive campaign to ban the use of anti-personnel landmines, which led to the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in 1997 by 122 countries and his own nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.In this wide-ranging lecture, Axworthy reflects on liberal values, Canadian politics, and the rise of U.S./Canadian border issues since the terrorist attack on the United States in September 2001. Axworthy’s distinctive voice shines through with personal anecdotes about his life in politics and his thoughts on Canada’s sometimes uneasy relations with its southern neighbour and largest trading partner.Axworthy addresses many troubling issues, including the conflict in Afghanistan where Canadian soldiers potentially contravened Canada’s international treaties by handing over prisoners to the U.S. He also discusses Canadian territorial sovereignty in the context of U.S. ‘homeland security,’ as well as international inaction on conflicts in Africa that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.Dr. Axworthy delivered Liberals at the Border in March 2002 as the sixth annual Senator Keith Davey Lecture at Victoria University in the University of Toronto.

Lords of the Rinks,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802037251.jpg,"The Emergence of the National Hockey League, 1875-1936

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Wong, John Chi-Kit

No sport is as important to Canadians as hockey. Though there may be a great many things that divide the country, the love of hockey is perhaps its single greatest unifier. Before the latest labour unrest in the National Hockey League (NHL), however, it was easy to forget that hockey is also a multi-million dollar business run, not by the athletes or coaches, but by corporate boards and businessmen. The Lords of the Rinks documents the early years of hockey?s professionalization and commercialization and the emergence of a fledgling NHL, from 1875 to 1936.

As the popularity of hockey grew in Canada in the late nineteenth century, so too did its commercial aspects, and players, club directors, rink owners, fans, and media had developed deep emotional, economic, and ideological interests in the sport. Disagreement came in the ways and means of how organized hockey, especially at the elite level, should be managed. Hence, some coordination, by way of governing bodies, was required to maintain a semblance of order. These early administrative bodies tried to maintain a structure that would help to coordinate the various interests, set up standards of behaviour, and impose mechanisms to detect and punish violators of governance. In 1917, the NHL held its first games and by 1936 had become the dominant governing body in professional hockey.

Having performed extensive research in the NHL archives, including league meeting minutes, letters, memos, telegrams, as well as gate receipt reports,  John Chi-Kit Wong traces the commercial roots of hockey and argues that, in its organized form, the sport was rarely if ever without some commercial aspects despite labels such as amateur and professional. The Lords of the Rinks is the only truly comprehensive and scholarly history of the league and the business of hockey.

Making Medicare,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442613454.jpg,"New Perspectives on the History of Medicare in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Gregory Marchildon (CA)

The Canadian health care system is so indisputably tied to our national identity that its founder, Tommy Douglas, was voted the greatest Canadian of all time in a CBC television contest. However, very little has been written to date on how Medicare as we know it was developed and implemented. This collection fills a serious gap in the existing literature by providing a comprehensive policy history of Medicare in Canada.Making Medicare features explorations of the experiments that predated the federal government’s decision to implement the Saskatchewan health care model, from Newfoundland’s cottage hospital system to Bennettcare in British Columbia. It also includes essays by key individuals (including health practitioners and two premiers) who played a role in the implementation of Medicare and the landmark Royal Commission on Health Services. Along with political scientists, policy specialists, medical historians, and health practitioners, this collection will appeal to anyone interested in the history and legacy of one of Canada’s most visible and centrally important institutions.

The book challenges us to rethink the presumed novelty of contemporary surveillance practices, while developing critical analyses of the ways in which state surveillance has profoundly shaped the emergence of contemporary societies, and the ways these systems of surveillance have been resisted, challenged, and subverted.

Making the Scene,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442610712.jpg,"Yorkville and Hip Toronto in the 1960s

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Stuart Henderson (CA)

Making the Scene is a history of 1960s Yorkville, Toronto's countercultural mecca. It narrates the hip Village's development from its early coffee house days, when folksingers such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell flocked to the scene, to its tumultuous, drug-fuelled final months. A flashpoint for hip youth, politicians, parents, and journalists alike, Yorkville was also a battleground over identity, territory, and power. Stuart Henderson explores how this neighbourhood came to be regarded as an alternative space both as a geographic area and as a symbol of hip Toronto in the cultural imagination.Through recently unearthed documents and underground press coverage, Henderson pays special attention to voices that typically aren't heard in the story of Yorkville - including those of women, working class youth, business owners, and municipal authorities. Through a local history, Making the Scene offers new, exciting ways to think about the phenomenon of counterculture and urban manifestations of a hip identity as they have emerged in cities across North America and beyond.

Mamaskatch,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781771622004.jpg,"A Cree Coming of Age

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Darrel J. McLeod

Growing up in the tiny village of Smith, Alberta, Darrel J. McLeod was surrounded by his Cree family’s history. In shifting and unpredictable stories, his mother, Bertha, shared narratives of their culture, their family and the cruelty that she and her sisters endured in residential school. McLeod was comforted by her presence and that of his many siblings and cousins, the smells of moose stew and wild peppermint tea, and his deep love of the landscape. Bertha taught him to be fiercely proud of his heritage and to listen to the birds that would return to watch over and guide him at key junctures of his life.

However, in a spiral of events, Darrel’s mother turned wild and unstable, and their home life became chaotic. Sweet and innocent by nature, Darrel struggled to maintain his grades and pursue an interest in music while changing homes many times, witnessing violence, caring for his younger siblings and suffering abuse at the hands of his surrogate father. Meanwhile, his sibling’s gender transition provoked Darrel to deeply question his own sexual identity.

The fractured narrative of Mamaskatch mirrors Bertha’s attempts to reckon with the trauma and abuse she faced in her own life, and captures an intensely moving portrait of a family of strong personalities, deep ties and the shared history that both binds and haunts them.

Beautifully written, honest and thought-provoking, Mamaskatch—named for the Cree word used as a response to dreams shared—is ultimately an uplifting account of overcoming personal and societal obstacles. In spite of the traumas of Darrel’s childhood, deep and mysterious forces handed down by his mother helped him survive and thrive: her love and strength stayed with him to build the foundation of what would come to be a very fulfilling and adventurous life.

Marshall McLuhan and Northrop Frye,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442616165.jpg,"Apocalypse and Alchemy

Author/Illustrator/Editor: B.W. Powe

Marshall McLuhan and Northrop Frye are two of Canada’s central cultural figures, colleagues and rivals whose careers unfolded in curious harmony even as their intellectual engagement was antagonistic. Poet, novelist, essayist and philosopher B.W. Powe, who studied with both of these formidable and influential intellectuals, presents an exploration of their lives and work in Marshall McLuhan and Northrop Frye: Apocalypse and Alchemy. Powe considers the existence of a unique visionary tradition of Canadian humanism and argues that McLuhan and Frye represent fraught but complementary approaches to the study of literature and to the broader engagement with culture. Examining their eloquent but often acid responses to each other, Powe exposes the scholarly controversies and personal conflicts that erupted between them, and notably the great commonalities in their writing and biographies. Using interviews, letters, notebooks, and their published texts, Powe offers a new alchemy of their thought, in which he combines the philosophical hallmarks of McLuhan’s “The medium is the message” and Frye’s “the great code.”

Memoirs of a Very Civil Servant,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802044457.jpg,"Mackenzie King to Pierre Trudeau

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Gordon Robertson (CA)

Born in Saskatchewan in 1917, Gordon Robertson worked at the centre of government power from 1945 until his retirement in 1979. He worked directly with Prime Ministers King, St-Laurent, Pearson, and Trudeau, serving as senior advisor to the latter two. Commissioner of the Northwest Territories from 1953 to 1963, he also became the first Deputy Minister of the new Department of Northern Affairs under Jean Lesage. In this memoir he presents a first-hand account of the events and personalities that shaped Canada during the critical post-war period.

Robertson tells of Canada’s development from colony to nation and the prime ministers who presided over the process. He provides an assessment of each prime minister in action: how they organized the cabinets, what their qualities were and how these related to their failures and successes. Himself influential in many areas of government, Robertson played a key role in the long debate on constitutional reform and national unity. Even after his retirement, he remained active as an unofficial constitutional networker.

Gordon Robertson has written no ordinary memoir. Along with the key events and personalities of his day he describes the development of his own ideas about the nature of Canada and its constitutional future. The result is a significant historical document, one that brings much insight to the history of post-war Canada.

Miscarriages of Justice in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802094063.jpg,"Causes, Responses, Remedies

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Kathryn M. Campbell

Innocent people are regularly convicted of crimes they did not commit. A number of systemic factors have been found to contribute to wrongful convictions, including eyewitness misidentification, false confessions, informant testimony, official misconduct, and faulty forensic evidence.

In Miscarriages of Justice in Canada, Kathryn M. Campbell offers an extensive overview of wrongful convictions, bringing together current sociological, criminological, and legal research, as well as current case-law examples. For the first time, information on all known and suspected cases of wrongful conviction in Canada is included and interspersed with discussions of how wrongful convictions happen, how existing remedies to rectify them are inadequate, and how those who have been victimized by these errors are rarely compensated. Campbell reveals that the causes of wrongful convictions are, in fact, avoidable, and that those in the criminal justice system must exercise greater vigilance and openness to the possibility of error if the problem of wrongful conviction is to be resolved.

My Conversations with Canadians,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781771663588.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Lee Maracle

Finalist for the 2018 Toronto Book Award

My Conversations With Canadians is the book that “Canada 150” needs.

On her first book tour at the age of 26, Lee Maracle was asked a question from the audience, one she couldn’t possibly answer at that moment. But she has been thinking about it ever since. As time has passed, she has been asked countless similar questions, all of them too big to answer, but not too large to contemplate. These questions, which touch upon subjects such as citizenship, segregation, labour, law, prejudice and reconciliation (to name a few), are the heart of My Conversations with Canadians.

In prose essays that are both conversational and direct, Maracle seeks not to provide any answers to these questions she has lived with for so long. Rather, she thinks through each one using a multitude of experiences she’s had as a First Nations leader, a woman, a mother, and grandmother over the course of her life. Lee Maracle’s My Conversations with Canadians presents a tour de force exploration into the writer’s own history and a reimagining of the future of our nation.

Praise for My Conversations with Canadians:

“My Conversations With Canadians… offer[s] strength and solidarity to Indigenous readers, and a generous guide to ally-ship for non-Indigenous readers. For the latter, these books will unsettle, but to engage in ally-ship is to commit to being unsettled–all the time.” —The Globe and Mail

Negotiating NAFTA,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802081704.jpg,"Explaining the Outcome in Culture, Textiles, Autos, and Pharmaceuticals

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Maryse Robert (CA)

International negotiations have become an important feature of the world trading system, but very few scholars have attempted to analyse this process. Using case studies in four areas - culture, textiles and apparel, autos, and pharmaceuticals - negotiated in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Maryse Robert uses a theoretical framework to help explain the outcome of such negotiations in terms of structure and process that. The structure of negotiations relates to states’ objectives, outcomes, resources (in industry and in government), and issue-specific power. Process involves state’s behaviour as expressed by its tactics during negotiation. Among the questions the author raises are: How are winning and losing defined in a given issue area? What are a state’s resources as it enters a trade negotiation? Are all resources equally important? Is the utility of some tactics linked to certain resources? The key message of the book is that it is the right mix of resources and tactics that determines the outcome of negotiation.Very few scholars have attempted to analyse trade negotiations. Using case studies in four areas - culture, textiles and apparel, autos and pharmaceuticals - Robert proposes a theoretical framework to help explain the outcome of a negotiation in the field of international trade. She argues that this outcome has two characteristics: structure and process. The former is constituted of the resources a state brings to the table in a given issue area; the latter refers to the state’s behaviour as expressed by its tactics during negotiation. The key message of the book is that it is the right mix of resources and tactics that determines the outcome.

"New Trends in Canadian Federalism, Second Edition",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551114149.jpg,"Editor: Miriam Smith (CA), François Rocher (CA)

This second edition renews the promise of the first: it offers a fresh and comprehensive exploration of the complexity of Canadian federal politics. It begins with a comprehensive section on constitutional politics, which examines topics ranging from executive federalism to multiculturalism including new chapters on judicial review and the division of powers, Aboriginal governance and federalism, and the implication of treaty rights for self-governance. This is followed by seven chapters that both provide a select survey of public policy areas and explore the impact of federal-provincial relations on policy evolution and outcomes. Updated chapters on trade policy, labour policy, the environment, regionalism, and, of course, health care are all to be found, alongside new work on social assistance and Canadian federalism and federation in comparative perspective. Throughout, the book reveals the visions that have animated Canada’s longstanding constitutional debates, the role of executive federalism and the courts in relation to the evolution of federalism, and the essential dynamism of policy development. Together they demonstrate that, despite the lack of a formal constitutional agreement, important changes are occurring in the Canadian federal system.

Northern Visions,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551114019.jpg,"New Perspectives on the North in Canadian History

Editor: Ken Coates (CA), Kerry Abel (CA)

Outstanding Academic Title, 2002 - Choice

Canadian nationalists in the 19th century argued that the North, with its extremes of winter, distance and isolation defined the country’s essential character and gave its population the resolve and determination necessary to create a prosperous nation. Promoters lauded its enormous economic potential while cursing its vast expanses and dangerous winters. Novelists, poets and painters were awestruck by its boundless reaches and environmental diversity. Today, the North retains its complex place within the Canadian psyche, at once celebrated as the very essence of the nation, while being largely ignored by a population that clings to the Canada-USA border. Many have debated its significance in Canada’s history, and have attempted to bring the region to the attention of the rest of the country by carving out a niche for norther history within the academic curriculum. The current generation of historians has a more ambitious and complex agenda. While they are interested in the North for its own sake, they also firmly believe that the study and teaching of Canadian history as a whole does not currently recognize the North’s importance to the development of the nation.

Northern Visions, by bringing together a variety of perspectives on the history of the North in Canada, raises new questions and challenges existing ideas. Provocative in their interpretations, these essays do not point to a single path forward in the writing of regional history, but instead suggest that it is time to rethink some of our basic conceptions—and misconceptions—about the North. Northern Visions calls upon historians of both region and nation to broaden their range of research, to connect regional developments to activities in other northern regions of the world, and to think much more widely about the place of the North in the understanding of Canada’s past.

Odysseys Home,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802043764.jpg,"Mapping African-Canadian Literature

Author/Illustrator/Editor: George Elliott Clarke (CA)

Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature is a pioneering study of African-Canadian literary creativity, laying the groundwork for future scholarly work in the field. Based on extensive excavations of archives and texts, this challenging passage through twelve essays presents a history of the literature and examines its debt to, and synthesis with, oral cultures. George Elliott Clarke identifies African-Canadian literature’s distinguishing characteristics, argues for its relevance to both African Diasporic Black and Canadian Studies, and critiques several of its key creators and texts. Scholarly and sophisticated, the survey cites and interprets the works of several major African-Canadian writers, including André Alexis, Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke, Claire Harris, and M. Nourbese Philip. In so doing, Clarke demonstrates that African-Canadian writers and critics explore the tensions that exist between notions of universalism and black nationalism, liberalism and conservatism. These tensions are revealed in the literature in what Clarke argues to be – paradoxically – uniquely Canadian and proudly apart from a mainstream national identity.Clarke has unearthed vital but previously unconsidered authors, and charted the relationship between African-Canadian literature and that of Africa, African America, and the Caribbean. In addition to the essays, Clarke has assembled a seminal and expansive bibliography of texts – literature and criticism – from both English and French Canada. This important resource will inevitably challenge and change future academic consideration of African-Canadian literature and its place in the international literary map of the African Diaspora.

One Hundred Years of Canadian Cinema,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802084446.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: George Melnyk (CA)

With its beginnings rooted in the languages and cultures of the French and English, Canadian cinema has, over time, become more representative, reflecting the interests and aspirations of Canada’s many diverse communities and identities. In One Hundred Years of Canadian Cinema, George Melnyk offers a twenty-first-century perspective on a fascinating film tradition, the distinctness of which has attracted the attention of the global cinematic community.Melnyk’s historical survey is comprehensive in its cinematic scope. He examines the achievement of dramatic, documentary, and experimental filmmaking from the earliest days until the present, giving due attention to the cinemas of Quebec and to the cultural, political, and theoretical trends that have shaped contemporary film in Canada. Following an interpretive approach, Melnyk explores the beginnings of a national cinema in the silent era at the end of the nineteenth century; the dynamics of the industry in the 1920s, which provide a model for the industry’s overall development; the rise of the NFB; the birth of a successful feature-film industry in Quebec in the forties; the tax-shelter era of the seventies; Canada’s achievements in animation; and the important contributions of key feature films and their directors in articulating insights into the cultural grammars found in Canadian society throughout the past century.Drawing on the insights of scholars, critics, and filmmakers to provide a coherent appraisal of the state of the film industry and Canada’s cinematic art as it enters its second century, Melnyk weaves the history of English and French Canada together in an attempt to understand the achievements and, ultimately, the failures of a ‘national cinema’. From Neighbours to Crash, Pour la suite du monde to Atanarjuat, and Goin’ Down the Road to Maelström, Melnyk argues passionately that Canadian cinema has never been a singular entity, but has continued to speak in the languages and in the voices of Canada’s diverse population. It is only through an ongoing and deepening exploration of diversity in Canadian film that its survival and evolution can be ensured.

One Job Town,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442610231.jpg,"Work, Belonging, and Betrayal in Northern Ontario

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Steven High

There’s a pervasive sense of betrayal in areas scarred by mine, mill and factory closures. Steven High’s One Job Town delves into the long history of deindustrialization in the paper-making town of Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, located on Canada’s resource periphery. Much like hundreds of other towns and cities across North America and Europe, Sturgeon Falls has lost their primary source of industry, resulting in the displacement of workers and their families.

One Job Town takes us into the making of a culture of industrialism and the significance of industrial work for mill-working families. One Job Town approaches deindustrialization as a long term, economic, political, and cultural process, which did not begin and simply end with the closure of the local mill in 2002. High examines the work-life histories of fifty paper mill workers and managers, as well as city officials, to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of the formation and dissolution of a culture of industrialism. Oral history and memory are at the heart of One Job Town, challenging us to rethink the relationship between the past and the present in what was formerly known as the industrialized world.

Featuring twelve original essays by a variety of scholars as well as a short memoir by former Canadian Ambassador to Cuba, Mark Entwistle, this important interdisciplinary collection calls into question past understandings of the Canadian-Cuban relationship. It is a must-read for anyone interested in Canadian and Cuban history of the last half-century, and the dynamics of North American politics more broadly.

Paddling Her Own Canoe,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802080240.jpg,"The Times and Texts of E. Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake)

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Carole Gerson (CA), Veronica Strong-Boag (CA)

Frequently dismissed as a ‘nature poet’ and an ‘Indian Princess’ E. Pauline Johnson (1861-1913) was not only an accomplished thinker and writer but a contentious and passionate personality who ‘talked back’ to Euro-Canadian culture. ""Paddling Her Own Canoe"" is the only major scholarly study that examines Johnson’s diverse roles as a First Nations champion, New Woman, serious writer and performer, and Canadian nationalist.A Native advocate of part-Mohawk ancestry, Johnson was also an independent, self-supporting, unmarried woman during the period of first-wave feminism. Her versatile writings range from extraordinarily erotic poetry to polemical statements about the rights of First Nations. Based on thorough research into archival and published sources, this volume probes the meaning of Johnson’s energetic career and addresses the complexities of her social, racial, and cultural position. While situating Johnson in the context of turn-of-the-century Canada, the authors also use current feminist and post-colonial perspectives to reframe her contribution. Included is the first full chronology ever compiled of Johnson’s writing.Pauline Johnson was an extraordinary woman who crossed the racial and gendered lines of her time, and thereby confounded Canadian society. This study reclaims both her writings and her larger significance.Winner of the Raymond Klibansky Prize, awarded by the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences

Parliamentary Democracy in Crisis,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442610149.jpg,"Editor: Peter H. Russell (CA), Lorne Sossin (CA)

In November 2008, as the economic decline was being fully realized, Canada’s newly elected minority government, led by Conservative Stephen Harper, presented a highly divisive fiscal update in advance of a proposed budget. Unable to support the motion, the Liberal and New Democratic Parties, with the backing of the Bloc Québécois, formed a coalition in order to seek a no-confidence vote and to form a new government. In response, Conservative cabinet ministers launched a media blitz, informing Canadians that the opposition was mounting a ‘coup d’état.’ Ultimately Governor General Michaëlle Jean allowed Parliament to be prorogued, the coalition fell apart, and a budget was accepted by the House in January 2009. However, widespread public uncertainty and confusion about the principles of government evident during the crisis revealed a grave lack of understanding about the mechanics and legalities of parliamentary democracy on the part of Canadians. With a foreword by former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, Parliamentary Democracy in Crisis brings together journalists, political scientists, and leading constitutional experts to analyse the crisis and to discuss the nature of Canada’s democracy. The contributors bring perspectives from both French and English Canada and cover all aspects of the crisis, including the prorogation of Parliament, the role of the governor general, the proposed Liberal-NDP coalition, the challenges of minority parliaments, and the now-evident rifts in the culture of Canadian democracy. Knowledgeable and comprehensive but still highly accessible, Parliamentary Democracy in Crisis provides a reasoned and timely response to Canada’s parliamentary crisis of November 2008.

Picturing Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085405.jpg,"A History of Canadian Children's Illustrated Books and Publishing

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Judith Saltman (CA), Gail Edwards (CA)

The study of children's illustrated books is located within the broad histories of print culture, publishing, the book trade, and concepts of childhood. An interdisciplinary history, Picturing Canada provides a critical understanding of the changing geographical, historical, and cultural aspects of Canadian identity, as seen through the lens of children's publishing over two centuries.Gail Edwards and Judith Saltman illuminate the connection between children's publishing and Canadian nationalism, analyse the gendered history of children's librarianship, identify changes and continuities in narrative themes and artistic styles, and explore recent changes in the creation and consumption of children's illustrated books. Over 130 interviews with Canadian authors, illustrators, editors, librarians, booksellers, critics, and other contributors to Canadian children's book publishing, document the experiences of those who worked in the industry.An important and wholly original work, Picturing Canada is fundamental to our understanding of publishing history and the history of childhood itself in Canada.

Pink Blood,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085702.jpg,"Homophobic Violence in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Douglas Victor Janoff (CA)

Despite Canada’s reputation as a beacon for equality in the international struggle for gay rights, homophobia and homophobic violence remain major problems in the country. Since 1990, hundreds of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people have been assaulted or murdered in Canada, but so far there has been little mention of the phenomenon in Canadian criminology textbooks or other publications.Pink Blood is the first book to analyze homophobic violence on a national scale. Douglas Victor Janoff uses social theory, legal analysis, descriptive case studies, and interviews with victims, activists, and police officers from thirty cities to convey the shattering impact this violence has had on queer Canadians and on the communities they inhabit. Janoff critically examines the concept of homophobia, the ‘homosexual panic defence,’ the ignorance and brutality of some Canadian police officers, and hate crime legislation and policies that, despite good intentions, are often powerless to counteract this complex and troubling social problem.Drawing from a wide range of scholarship—law, criminology, sociology, psychology, philosophy and social work—Pink Blood is an important addition to the literature on queer life in Canada from a respected researcher and community activist.

Political Thought in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551117119.jpg,"An Intellectual History

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Katherine Fierlbeck (CA)

What, if anything, makes Canada’s political identity unique? Pollsters can measure values, but they cannot explain how these values arose over time, why they changed, or how people have attempted to make sense of them within a changing social and political environment. By examining the history of political ideas in Canada, we can better understand why Canada takes the shape that it does. In this book, Katherine Fierlbeck looks at the legacy of ideas taken from (or shaped in reaction to) the nations that have been most influential to Canada’s development: the United Kingdom and the United States. The first section looks specifically at the nature of toryism, constitutional liberalism, and market liberalism. Then she examines the evolution of social justice in Canada. Does the country have, as J.S. Woodsworth hoped, a definitive ""third way."" The final section focuses upon debates over cultural identity and minority rights. Contemporary political discussions in Canada are very much based upon the expressions of French-Canadian nationalism that have existed as long as, and perhaps even longer than, the country itself. How have these ideas influenced current thinking about culture and accommodation?

The experiences characterized by Canadian political thought also provide insight and ideas for nations around the world as their citizens struggle with similar questions. The political dynamics of the present are a product of how Canadians have viewed their country, or a vision of their country, in the past. These ideas of Canada, in history and in myth, provide a way of thinking about politics that may provoke and inspire Canadians—and others—to reflect upon their future.

"Politics, Society, and the Media, second edition",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551111810.jpg,"Canadian Perspectives

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Paul Nesbitt-Larking (CA)

Politics, Society, and the Media is the first comprehensive political sociology of the media to be published in Canada. Paul Nesbitt-Larking draws upon a range of disciplines, including cultural and media studies, political economy, social theory, and political science to provide an analysis of the relationship between power and representation in Canada.

The framework for the book presents a model of the mutual interaction between politics and the media. Attention is focused in the early chapters on how cultural, ideological, economic, and governmental forces shape and condition the production of media in Canada. Chapters on the work of Innis, Grant, McLuhan, and their postmodern successors place the evolution of McLuhan’s theoretical argument that “the medium is the message” at the heart of the book. Canadian identity, and how to understand Canadian media politically, is the subject of a chapter on textual analysis. Two extensive chapters follow on the media’s influence and effects on politics.

In addition to standard topics on politics and the media, this new edition offers much more: an examination of the media on the politics of gender and aboriginal peoples, the micro-politics of the media workplace, and an exploration of important media-related considerations. Throughout, reference is made to relevant and compelling issues placed within the context of media theory.

"Power, Money, and Trade",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551116839.jpg,"Decisions that Shape Global Economic Relations

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Mark R. Brawley (CA)

This book is an introduction to International Relations that uses examples from International Political Economy (IPE). It presents the theories and paradigms of International Relations in the context of the issues of trade, investment, and monetary relations. Largely it does so by developing historical cases of pivotal events in the evolution of the IPE to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. This focus on the substantive material of the IPE allows a shift beyond traditional debates to include newer paradigms such as Constructivism and Institutionalism. The result is a book that not only reveals and explains prominent arguments and debates, but also provides grounding in the history and structure of the IPE.

The first half of the book explains the main features of the IPE. It develops and illustrates the ways in which political scientists elaborate and employ theories of International Relations by classifying and examining the main levels of analysis from characteristics of the international system, through those of nation states, to explanations of policy effected by officials. The second half examines important historical cases chosen both to illustrate theories and also to chart the overall patterns of change. Readers are thereby introduced to important theories and issues in International Relations and to key historical episodes from the late nineteenth century to the recent East Asian financial crisis. Special attention is paid to critical decisions in the development of American and Canadian foreign policies

Practical Judgments,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802036759.jpg,"Essays in Culture, Politics, and Interpretation

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Kingwell, Mark

What does it mean to be both a professor of philosophy and a public intellectual in an age when every CEO is hailed as an intellectual, every adman a visionary? When the opinions of TV pundits and ‘fast thinkers’ seem to carry the day? When academics bemoan the loss of critical engagement and dialogue?The essays and book reviews collected in Practical Judgments represent popular Toronto philosopher and cultural theorist Mark Kingwell’s negotiation of the space where academe collides with the world outside the ivory tower. Kingwell considers cricket and consciousness, dandies and television, the ethics of books and lifestyles, and the possibility of critical theory. He looks to Nietzsche, Husserl, and Adorno for inspiration, but also to Cary Grant, Bruce Mau, and Jorge Luis Borges.Throughout, Kingwell shows a deep respect for the philosophical enterprise in its peculiar current conditions and a commitment to think sharply and with self-awareness about these conditions. Intended as both a philosophical examination of the commonplace virtues of wonder, civility, and common sense, and a realistic illustration of how Kingwell sees them working, Practical Judgments calls attention to the process of thinking and, by example, encourages the reader to engage in similar philosophizing. The book itself is structured to show the arc of thought, from the more abstract, scholarly examinations of people and ideas, to critical reflections on the impetus for philosophy and its possibilities as a force for change in the world around us.Practical Judgments reveals the sources and developments of Kingwell’s thought and examines the nature and limits of intellectual engagement. It displays Kingwell’s political commitment to a hermeneutic form of social democracy by revealing a careful attention to the texture of daily cultural affairs. Arguing for a form of critical engagement without which political action is impossible, Kingwell shows that attention to everyday life is worthwhile both in itself and as part of a larger philosophical endeavour.

Prizing Literature,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442642713.jpg,"The Celebration and Circulation of National Culture

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Gillian Roberts

When Canadian authors win prestigious literary prizes, from the Governor General’s Literary Award to the Man Booker Prize, they are celebrated not only for their achievements, but also for contributing to this country’s cultural capital. Discussions about culture, national identity, and citizenship are particularly complicated when the honorees are immigrants, like Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, or Rohinton Mistry. Then there is the case of Yann Martel, who is identified both as Canadian and as rootlessly cosmopolitan. How have these writers’ identities been recalibrated in order to claim them as ‘representative’ Canadians?

Prizing Literature is the first extended study of contemporary award winning Canadian literature and the ways in which we celebrate its authors. Gillian Roberts uses theories of hospitality to examine how prize-winning authors are variously received and honoured depending on their citizenship and the extent to which they represent ‘Canadianness.’ Prizing Literature sheds light on popular and media understandings of what it means to be part of a multicultural nation.

Public intellectual in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442613393.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Wiseman, Nelson

This illuminating, entertaining, and timely volume examines the place and impact of public intellectuals in our rapidly changing and diverse society. Boasting an all-star cast of contributors – including some of Canada’s most prominent writers, journalists, and academics – it probes the role of public discourse and intellectual persuasion in shaping Canada’s past, present, and future.

The Public Intellectual in Canada examines how individuals have come to assume this role, how they are received by various publics, and what they have been able to accomplish. The pieces cover topics ranging from the potential and perils of advocacy to the influence of think tanks on public policy. Many pieces also delve into the roles of pollsters, political actors, pundits, social activists, economists, and ethicists, among others.

Broad in scope and stylistically diverse, these essays offer a fascinating overview of the links between thought, public exposition, and action in the fields of politics, science, and culture.

Quebec in a Global Light,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487504717.jpg,"Reaching for the Common Ground

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Robert Calderisi

In this masterful survey of the major social and economic issues facing Québec, Robert Calderisi offers an intimate look into the sensitivities and strengths of a society that has grown accustomed to being misunderstood. In doing so, he argues that the values uniting Quebeckers—their common sense, courtesy, concern for the downtrodden, aversion to conflict, and mild form of nationalism, linked to a firm refusal to be homogenized by globalization—make them the most Canadian of all Canadians.

Queering Urban Justice,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487522858.jpg,"Queer of Colour Formations in Toronto

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Jinthana Haritaworn

Queering Urban Justice foregrounds visions of urban justice that are critical of racial and colonial capitalism, and asks: What would it mean to map space in ways that address very real histories of displacement and erasure? What would it mean to regard Queer, Trans, Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (QTBIPOC) as geographic subjects who model different ways of inhabiting and sharing space?

The volume describes city spaces as sites where bodies are exhaustively documented while others barely register as subjects. The editors and contributors interrogate the forces that have allowed QTBIPOC to be imagined as absent from the very spaces they have long invested in. From the violent displacement of poor, disabled, racialized, and sexualized bodies from Toronto’s gay village, to the erasure of queer racialized bodies in the academy, Queering Urban Justice offers new directions to all who are interested in acting on the intersections of social, racial, economic, urban, migrant, and disability justice.

Author/Illustrator/Editor: David Schneiderman

Situated between two constitutional traditions, those of the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada has maintained a distinctive third way: federal, parliamentary, and flexible. Yet, in recent years it seems that Canadian constitutional culture has been moving increasingly in an American direction. Red, White, and Kind of Blue? is a comparative legal analysis of this creeping Americanization, as well as a probing examination of the costs and benefits that come with it. Comparing British, Canadian, and American constitutional traditions, David Schneiderman offers a critical perspective on the Americanization of Canadian constitutional practice and a timely warning about its unexamined consequences.

Resurgence and Reconciliation,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487523275.jpg,"Indigenous-Settler Relations and Earth Teachings

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Michael Asch

The two major schools of thought in Indigenous-Settler relations on the ground, in the courts, in public policy, and in research are resurgence and reconciliation. Resurgence refers to practices of Indigenous self-determination and cultural renewal whereas reconciliation refers to practices of reconciliation between Indigenous and Settler nations, such as nation-with-nation treaty negotiations. Reconciliation also refers to the sustainable reconciliation of both Indigenous and Settler peoples with the living earth as the grounds for both resurgence and Indigenous-Settler reconciliation.

Critically and constructively analyzing these two schools from a wide variety of perspectives and lived experiences, this volume connects both discourses to the ecosystem dynamics that animate the living earth. Resurgence and Reconciliation is multi-disciplinary, blending law, political science, political economy, women’s studies, ecology, history, anthropology, sustainability, and climate change. Its dialogic approach strives to put these fields in conversation and draw out the connections and tensions between them.

By using “earth-teachings” to inform social practices, the editors and contributors offer a rich, innovative, and holistic way forward in response to the world’s most profound natural and social challenges. This timely volume shows how the complexities and interconnections of resurgence and reconciliation and the living earth are often overlooked in contemporary discourse and debate.

Royal Spectacle,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802086655.jpg,"The 1860 Visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada and the United States

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Ian Radforth (CA)

In 1860, Queen Victoria sent her eighteen-year-old son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, on a goodwill mission to Canada and the United States. The young heir-apparent (later King Edward VII) had not yet gained his reputation as a fashion setter and rake, but he nevertheless attracted enormous crowds both in Canada, where it was the first royal visit, and in the United States. Civic leaders hosted the visitor in princely style, decorating their towns with triumphal arches and organizing royal entries, public processions, openings, and grand balls.In Royal Spectacle, Ian Radforth recreates these displays of civic pride by making use of the many public and private accounts of them, and he analyses the heated controversies the visit provoked. When communities rushed to honour the prince and put themselves on display, social divisions inadvertently became part of the spectacle seen by the prince and described by visiting journalists. Street theatre reached a climax in Kingston, where the Prince of Wales could not disembark from his steamer because of the defiance of thousands of Orangemen dressed in their brilliant regalia and waiving their banners.Contemporary depictions of the tour provide an opportunity to interpret the cultural values and social differences that shaped Canada during the Confederation decade and the United States on the eve of the Civil War. Topics explored include Orange-Green conflict, First Nations and the politics of public display, contested representations of race and gender, the tourist gaze, and meanings of crown and empire. An original and erudite study, Royal Spectacle contributes greatly to historical research on public spectacle, colonial and national identities, Britishness in the Atlantic world, and the history of the monarchy.

“Canada has a painful history of racially segregated hospitals that were intended to isolate and institutionalize Aboriginal people seen as a menace and danger to the nation. Separate Beds is a sophisticated, analytical, and lucid history of this neglected chapter of Canada’s history.” – Sarah Carter, University of Alberta

Separate Beds is the shocking story of Canada’s system of segregated health care. Maureen K. Lux describes the arbitrary and contradictory policies that governed the “Indian Hospitals,” the experiences of patients and staff, and the vital grassroots activism that pressed the federal government to acknowledge its treaty obligations. A disturbing look at the dark side of the liberal welfare state, Separate Beds reveals a history of racism and negligence in health care for Canada’s First Nations that should never be forgotten.

Smoke and Mirrors,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802089489.jpg,"Globalized Terrorism and the Illusion of Multilateral Security

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Frank P. Harvey (CA)

The threat of terrorism has become a fact of life for American citizens and, by extension, an important issue for current and future U.S. governments. International relations are inevitably affected by this situation, yet allies of the United States have of late been decrying the Bush administration’s move toward unilateralism and its sceptical attitude toward multilateral approaches to security.In Smoke and Mirrors, Frank P. Harvey mounts a powerful case for American unilateralism by exposing the real costs, potential risks, and catastrophic failures of multilateral alternatives, that are rarely acknowledged by proponents. He addresses the relationship between globalization, terrorism, and unilateralism, and provides a systematic explanation for, and defence of, Washington’s response to threats of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The reality of an increasingly fragile national security environment will impose tremendous pressure on Republican and Democratic leaders alike, and will compel American officials to prioritize safety, protection, and invulnerability above all else in an effort to become self-reliant in matters of security.Harvey develops his arguments with evidence from two significant case studies: the American ballistic missile defence program and the 2003 war in Iraq. He argues that, as the costs and risks of relying exclusively on multilateralism increase, the logical, legal, strategic, and moral reasons for embracing only multilateral approaches to security are becoming more tenuous. The implications for Canada and Europe are obvious. As the U.S. becomes more threatened, the pressures that drive American unilateralism will clash with the foreign, economic, and security policies of other powers, including traditional allies, themselves motivated by a competing set of unilateral self-interests.Smoke and Mirrors will compel critics of the Bush administration to move beyond the assumption that American foreign policies are temporary in nature. Indeed, the tensions caused by terrorism and proliferation will continue to shape Washington’s threat perceptions and responses for decades. The book challenges critics to demonstrate the successes ? as distinct from the promises ? of multilateral security and to prove that their preferred alternative has achieved the victories that would justify a sweeping rejection of unilateralism.

Social Fabric or Patchwork Quilt,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551115443.jpg,"The Development of Social Policy in Canada

Editor: Raymond B. Blake (CA), Jeffrey Keshen (CA)

Both historical and contemporary features of Canadian social welfare are explored in this wide-ranging and in-depth collection. Social Fabric or Patchwork Quilt explores the evolution of the Canadian social welfare state from a system based upon voluntarism and philanthropy to one in which the State’s involvement has increased considerably. It also shows how the roles of governments at all levels have changed in recent times.

Chapters describe the developing Canadian welfare state from Confederation to the present. Beginning with an integrative framework in the general introduction, the selected essays represent many perspectives: chronological, regional, multidisciplinary and ideological. An important feature of this collection is the consideration of providers and recipients. Such wide-ranging outlooks are possible given the diverse backgrounds of contributors, which include historians, sociologists, social workers, public policy experts and political scientists. As well as historical and sociological studies, topics include key programs (discussed in detail), the quality of services received by principal target groups, new directions in research; some contributions even revisit foundational older works and key government documents.

Stickhandling through the Margins,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442613386.jpg,"First Nations Hockey in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Michael A. Robidoux (CA)

Some of hockey’s fiercest and most passionate players and fans can be found among Canada&apos;s First Nations populations, including NHL greats Jordin Tootoo, Jonathan Cheechoo, and Gino Odjick. At first glance the importance of hockey to the country&apos;s Aboriginal peoples may seem to indicate assimilation into mainstream society, but Michael A. Robidoux reveals that the game is played and understood very differently in this cultural context. Rather than capitulating to the Euro-Canadian construct of sport, First Nations hockey has become an important site for expressing rich local knowledge and culture.With stories and observations gleaned from three years of ethnographic research, Stickhandling through the Margins richly illustrates how hockey is played and experienced by First Nations peoples across Canada, both in isolated reserve communities and at tournaments that bring together participants from across the country. Robidoux&apos;s vivid description transports readers into the world of First Nations hockey, revealing it to be a highly social and at times even spiritual activity ripe with hidden layers of meaning that are often surprising to the outside observer.

Sustainable Development and Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551113234.jpg,"National and International Perspectives

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Rebecca Tiessen (CA), John Patrick Kyba (CA), Peter Stoett (CA), O.P. Dwivedi (CA)

Canada is one of the most beautiful, varied, and inspiring natural environments on earth. Few countries contain such topographical differences as the West Coast, the mountain regions, the prairies, the Arctic, the cityscapes close to the American border, and the eastern forests. The Canadian territory is the second largest in the world, and it borders on three oceans--its fourth border is with the United States, the most powerful economy in the world. This provides Canadians unique access to a large market, but also raises many problems related not only to political and cultural influence, but to transborder pollution.

This book investigates the complexities of Canadian environmental policy. The text is split into three sections: the political context in which decisions are made; issue areas in need of engagement; and perspectives on the achievement of sustainable development, which colour the Canadian conceptual landscape.

The first section outlines the state of the Canadian environment, the actors and institutions involved in environmental policy formation (and a detailed history of Environment Canada), and the international context of modern decision-making. The second section is issue-specific, including chapters on environmental law, risk management and environmental impact assessment, international treaties and conventions involving Canada, and an overall assessment of Canadian policy. The final section deals with values and theories, from gender issues to environmental ethics. The book serves as a comprehensive introduction that makes explicit recognition of the transnational character of environmental policy formation in the era of globalization, and offers critical insights into the decision-making process.

Take One’s Essential Guide to Canadian Film,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802083982.jpg,"Editor: Wyndham Wise (CA)

Take One’s Essential Guide to Canadian Film is the most exhaustive and up-to-date reference book on Canadian film and filmmakers, combining 700 reviews and biographical listings with a detailed chronology of major events in Canadian film and television history. Compiled by Wyndham Wise, the editor and publisher of Take One, Canada’s most respected film magazine, with a foreword by Canadian director Patricia Rozema, this is the only reference book of its kind published in English. Each film title is listed with credits, a mini review, and significant awards. Biographical listings of directors, producers, actors, writers, animators, cinematographers, distributors, exhibitors, and independent filmmakers are accompanied by date and place of birth, date of death if applicable, a brief career overview, and a filmography. Wise celebrates Canadian achievement on both a national and an international scale, and juxtaposes the distinctly Canadian with Canada’s exports to Hollywood: Maury Chaykin and Jim Carrey, John Candy and William Shatner, Mon Oncle Antoine and Porky’s, Highway 61 and Meatballs, The Red Violin and The Art of War.From great early Hollywood stars like Walter Huston, Fay Wray, Mary Pickford, Norma Shearer, and Marie Dressler, to our current crop of star directors - including Patricia Rozema, Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg, Denys Arcand, Peter Mettler, Guy Maddin, and Robert Lepage - Canadians have made an important but largely unrecorded contribution to the history of world cinema. Impressive for its breadth of coverage, refreshing in its opinionated informality, this comprehensive and lively look at Canadian film culture at the start of the twenty-first century admirably fills the gap.

Talking Back to the Indian Act,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487587352.jpg,"Critical Readings in Settler Colonial Histories

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Mary-Ellen Kelm

Talking Back to the Indian Act is a comprehensive “how-to” guide for engaging with primary source documents. The intent of the book is to encourage readers to develop the skills necessary to converse with primary sources in more refined and profound ways. As a piece of legislation that is central to Canada’s relationship with Indigenous peoples and communities, and one that has undergone many amendments, the Indian Act is uniquely positioned to act as a vehicle for this kind of focused reading.

Through an analysis of thirty-five sources pertaining to the Indian Act—addressing governance, gender, enfranchisement, and land—the authors provide readers with a much better understanding of this pivotal piece of legislation, as well as insight into the dynamics involved in its creation and maintenance.

Telling Our Stories,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551115801.jpg,"Omushkego Legends and Histories from Hudson Bay

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Louis Bird (CA)

Editor: Paul W. DePasquale (CA), Jennifer S. H. Brown (CA)

Since the 1970s, Louis Bird, a distinguished Aboriginal storyteller and historian, has been recording the stories and memories of Omushkego (Swampy Cree) communities along western Hudson and James Bays. In nine chapters, he presents some of the most vivid legends and historical stories from his collection, casting new light on his people’s history, culture, and values. Working with the editors and other contributors to provide background and context for the stories, he illuminates their many levels of meaning and brings forward the value system and world-view that underlie their teachings. Students of Aboriginal culture, history, and literature will find that this is no ordinary book of stories compiled from a remote, disconnected voice, but rather a project in which the teller, deeply engaged in preserving his people’s history, language, and values, is committed to bringing his listeners and readers as far along the road to understanding as he possibly can.

The Bartering Mindset,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487500962.jpg,"A Mostly Forgotten Framework for Mastering Your Next Negotiation

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Brian C. Gunia

We use money to solve our everyday problems, but money has a psychological downside: it trains us to think about negotiations narrow-mindedly, leading us to negotiate badly. In the bartering economies of the past, barterers had to use a more sophisticated form of negotiation to trade what they had for what they needed. Brian C. Gunia shows us how to look outside today’s monetary economy and apply the “bartering mindset” to make us master negotiators.

The Canadian Horror Film,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442628502.jpg,"Terror of the Soul

Editor: Gina Freitag and André Loiselle

From the cheaply made “tax-shelter” films of the 1970s to the latest wave of contemporary “eco-horror,” Canadian horror cinema has rarely received much critical attention. Gina Freitag and André Loiselle rectify that situation in The Canadian Horror Film with a series of thought-provoking reflections on Canada’s “terror of the soul,” a wasteland of docile damnation and prosaic pestilence where savage beasts and mad scientists rub elbows with pasty suburbanites, grumpy seamen, and baby-faced porn stars. Featuring chapters on Pontypool, Ginger Snaps, 1970s slasher films, Quebec horror, and the work of David Cronenberg, among many others, The Canadian Horror Film unearths the terrors hidden in the recesses of the Canadian psyche. It examines the highlights of more than a century of Canadian horror filmmaking and includes an extensive filmography to guide both scholars and enthusiasts alike through this treacherous terrain.

The Canadian Regime,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442600478.jpg,"An Introduction to Parliamentary Government in Canada, Fourth Edition

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Patrick Malcolmson (CA), Richard Myers (CA)

Lucid and readable, The Canadian Regime is a well-established, well-known introduction to Canadian government. By explaining the inner logic of parliamentary government, as well as the underlying rationale for its institutions and processes, the authors demystify what might appear to be a relatively complex political system. Urging readers to consider the organic nature of the political system—in which change in one area inevitably ripples through the rest of the system—the authors provide much more than just a description of the features of government.The fourth edition has been updated to include analysis of the 2008 Canadian federal election. Discussions of responsible government and the role of the Governor General have been revised and expanded. Coalition government, the Single Transferable Vote, and the emergence of the Green Party are explained and new developments in Senate reform and Supreme Court appointments are also covered.

The Charter Revolution and the Court Party,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551110899.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: F.L. Morton (CA), Rainer Knopff

The Charter of Rights has transformed Canadian politics. The Supreme Court has used the Charter to change government policy on an ever-expanding list of controversial issues—abortion, aboriginal rights, gay rights, bilingualism, criminal law enforcement, and prisoner-voting. The Court has made itself the second most powerful institution in Canadian politics after the Federal Cabinet. Morton and Knopff demonstrate that the Court is not so much the cause as the means by which the Charter Revolution has been achieved. Behind the judges is a well orchestrated network of state-funded interest groups that use litigation and the media to achieve what they can’t win through democratic elections.

The Development of Political Thought in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551117102.jpg,"An Anthology

Editor: Katherine Fierlbeck (CA)

Contemporary Canadian political thought is fresh, provocative, and ubiquitous. But how can we explain the popularity of the present within the context of the past? The premise of this book is that Canada’s intellectual heritage is disappearing from the consciousness of its citizens. For contemporary undergraduates there is no one source in print that presents an historical survey of Canadian political thought. Indeed, many undergraduates are never introduced to even the most iconic figures in political thought in this country, such as C.B. Macpherson, Kari Levitt, or George Grant. And for the wider audience of reflective and thoughtful Canadians outside of the universities, there is little guidance in understanding how the abstract political debates surrounding such issues as health care, foreign policy, or asymmetrical federalism evolved. Few are cynical enough to believe that all major political decisions are based solely on an expression of political opportunism. But what confluence of political ideas permitted the implementation of real political achievements?

This book presents selections of Canadian political thought from the nineteenth century to the present to show how ideas evolved over time to influence the values and debates of modern Canadians. The readings are generally arranged chronologically, but the three currents of thought that inform the selections are Canada’s relation to the United States, English Canada’s relationship with French Canada, and the nature of a ""Canadian"" social justice.

The European Roots of Canadian Identity,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551117058.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Philip Resnick (CA)

What makes Canada a different kind of society from the United States? In this book-length essay, Philip Resnick argues that, in more ways than one, Canada has been profoundly marked by its European origins. This is most apparent where the European historical underpinnings both of English-speaking and French-speaking Canada are concerned, but it is no less true when one examines Canada’s multiple national identities, robust social programs, increasingly secular values and multilateral outlook on international affairs today. As the war in Iraq brought home, and the 2004 federal election reinforced, Canada is a more European-type society than is our neighbour to the south.

This does not come without its own complexities or problems. On the contrary, there are significant parallels between the ambiguous versions of national identity that one finds in Canada and what one finds on the European continent. There are parallels, too, between the elements of self-doubt that characterize Canadians overall when they think about their country and those of Europeans caught up in their own, often fractious, attempts to forge a more integrated Europe. The author argues that Canada needs Europe as an effective counter-weight to the influence of the United States. He further argues that, at a deeper existential level, Canadians need relevant European references to better understand what makes them the kind of North Americans that they are.

The Girl and the Game,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551112688.jpg,"A History of Women's Sport in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: M. Ann Hall (CA)

The Girl and the Game traces the history of women’s organized sport in Canada from its early, informal roots in the late nineteenth century through the formation of amateur and professional teams to today’s tendency to market women athletes, especially Olympians, as both athletic and sexual. When women actively participate in the symbols, practices, and institutions of sport, what they do is often not considered ""real"" sport, nor in some cases are they viewed as ""real"" women. What follows from this notion of sport as a site of cultural struggle is that the history of women in sport is also a history of cultural resistance.

The Girl from God’s Country,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802085429.jpg,"Nell Shipman and the Silent Cinema

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Kay Armatage (CA)

In The Girl from God’s Country, Kay Armatage reintroduces film studies scholars to Nell Shipman, a pioneer in both Canadian and American film, and one of proportionately numerous women from Hollywood‘s silent era who wrote, directed, produced, and acted in motion pictures. Born and raised in British Columbia, Shipman became a contract actress for Vitagraph Studios, starring in God’s Country and the Woman (1915) and Back to God’s Country (1919), among other films. These action-packed adventure melodramas, in which the heroine is called upon to rescue her husband and defeat the villain, were immensely successful. Later, Shipman started up her own production company to make films centred on her screen persona, ‘the girl from God’s country.’ By the mid 1920s, however, the formation of the large Hollywood studios and vertical integration closed down the independents, Shipman among them. Nevertheless, she continued writing until her death in 1970.Through the use of social history, feminist film theory, and biography, Armatage creates a portrait of a woman film pioneer. Using Shipman‘s working life as a window to the profession, Armatage explores the position of women in modernism, the developing film industry, and cinematic practice of the 1920s. The Girl from God’s Country also contextualizes Shipman‘s work within the development of Hollywood as a locus of artistic production and in relation to women filmmakers from Europe, Australia, Russia and the United States. Armatage brings Shipman back to life in this important book.

The Impact of 9/11 on Canada - U.S. Trade,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802097866.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Steven Globerman, Paul Storer

The events of 9/11 and subsequent border entry security initiatives have led to increased costs and transportation delays that have the potential to impact Canada-U.S. trade. Researchers have identified increased border crossing times for importers and exporters transporting goods between the two countries, but there has been little effort made to identify the quantitative importance of these developments in terms of their effect on bilateral trade flows. In this study, Steven Globerman and Paul Storer fill this gap in the existing research through statistical analysis of trade flows since 9/11.Among the questions undertaken in this book are whether trade flows are lower in the post-9/11 period than they should be, and whether ‘special’ factors apart from 9/11 might have influenced flow in major bilateral sectors. Globerman and Storer show that U.S. exports to Canada decreased significantly in the aftermath of 9/11, though such exports recovered by 2004. In contrast, while U.S. imports from Canada also suffered a significant post-9/11 decrease, a shortfall between actual and expected imports from Canada persisted through 2005. In other words, by mid-2005, Canadian exports to the U.S. had not regained their ‘normal level.’ These and other conclusions are crucial to understanding the impact that increased border security has had on the economic relationship between Canada and the United States.

The L.M. Montgomery Reader,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442644922.jpg,"Volume Two: A Critical Heritage

Editor: Benjamin Lefebvre

Following on the heels of the first volume of The L.M. Montgomery Reader, this second volume narrates the development of L.M. Montgomery’s (1874–1942) critical reputation in the seventy years since her death. Edited by leading Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre, it traces milestones and turning points such as adaptations for stage and screen, posthumous publications, and the development of Montgomery Studies as a scholarly field. Lefebvre’s introduction also considers Montgomery’s publishing history in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom at a time when her work remained in print not because it was considered part of a university canon of literature, but simply due to the continued interest of readers. The twenty samples of Montgomery scholarship included in this volume broach topics such as gender and genre, narrative strategies in fiction and life writing, translation, and Montgomery’s archival papers. They reflect shifts in Montgomery's critical reputation decade by decade: the 1960s, when a milestone chapter on Montgomery coincided with a second wave of texts seeking to create a canon of Canadian literature; the 1970s, in the midst of a sustained reassessment of popular fiction and of literature by women; the 1980s, when the publication of Montgomery’s life writing, which coincided with the broadcast of critically acclaimed television productions adapted from her fiction, radically altered how readers perceived her and her work; the 1990s, when a conference series on Montgomery began to generate a sustained amount of scholarship; and the opening years of the twenty-first century, when the field of Montgomery Studies became both international and interdisciplinary. This is the first book to consider the posthumous life of one of Canada's most enduringly popular authors.

The L.M. Montgomery Reader,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442644915.jpg,"Volume One: A Life in Print

Editor: Benjamin Lefebvre

The L.M. Montgomery Reader assembles significant rediscovered primary material on one of Canada’s most enduringly popular authors throughout her high-profile career and after her death. Each of its three volumes gathers pieces published all over the world to set the stage for a much-needed reassessment of Montgomery’s literary reputation. Much of the material is freshly unearthed from archives and digital collections and has never before been published in book form. The selections appearing in this first volume focus on Montgomery’s role as a public celebrity and author of the resoundingly successful Anne of Green Gables (1908). They give a strong impression of her as a writer and cultural critic as she discusses a range of topics with wit, wisdom, and humour, including the natural landscape of Prince Edward Island, her wide readership, anxieties about modernity, and the continued relevance of “old ideals.” These essays and interviews, joined by a number of additional pieces that discuss her work’s literary and cultural value in relation to an emerging canon of Canadian literature, make up nearly one hundred selections in all. Each volume is accompanied by an extensive introduction and detailed commentary by leading Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre that trace the interplay between the author and the critic, as well as between the private and the public Montgomery. This volume – and the Reader as a whole – adds tremendously to our understanding and appreciation of Montgomery’s legacy as a Canadian author and as a literary celebrity both during and beyond her lifetime.

Immigration policy is a subject of intense political and public debate. In this second edition of the widely recognized and authoritative work The Making of the Mosaic, Ninette Kelley and Michael Trebilcock have thoroughly revised and updated their examination of the ideas, interests, institutions, and rhetoric that have shaped Canada's immigration history.Beginning their study in the pre-Confederation period, the authors interpret major episodes in the evolution of Canadian immigration policy, including the massive deportations of the First World War and Depression eras as well as the Japanese-Canadian internship camps during World War Two. New chapters provide perspective on immigration in a post-9/11 world, where security concerns and a demand for temporary foreign workers play a defining role in immigration policy reform. A comprehensive and important work, The Making of the Mosaic clarifies the attitudes underlying each phase and juncture of immigration history, providing vital perspective on the central issues of immigration policy that continue to confront us today.

The Natural History of Canadian Mammals,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442644830.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Donna Naughton (CA), Canadian Museum of Nature (CA)

A Northern Pocket Gopher can dig an amazing half a metre of tunnel through compacted clay soil in just 15 minutes. North American Beavers, along with humans, are the only mammals whose impact on their environment is so massive that it can be clearly seen with the naked eye from outer space. And there really are Narwhals – the single-tusked mammals that likely inspired the unicorn legend – living in the waters surrounding Greenland.Learning about any of these mammals on their own brings out fascinating traits and stories. But when considered alongside the entire mammal population of Canada – from the tiny Olive-Backed Pocket Mouse to the enormous Killer Whale, and the Arctic-dwelling Polar Bear to the more southerly Red Bat – a spectacular portrait emerges of the diversity and beauty of Canada’s animal life.The Natural History of Canadian Mammals is a beautifully illustrated, up-to-date guide to all 215 known species of mammals in Canada. It features brand-new, full-colour images of each species, as well as stunning photographs from Canadian Geographic magazine’s national photography competitions depicting the animals in their natural environments. Along with being a visual treat, this book is jam-packed with information accessible to readers at all levels. Detailed descriptions are provided of each mammal’s appearance, habitat, and behavior, while colour maps show their full distribution across Canada, North America, and globally. The book also includes practical guides on tracking and identification for readers who would like to learn how to spot mammals in the wild. Among its most special features is a series of colour plates with vignettes of the Canadian representatives of each group, sized relative to one another for easy comparison and linked to the full species accounts later in the book.Comprehensive and immensely valuable, The Natural History of Canadian Mammals will become a treasured companion for scientific researchers, animal lovers, and all those wishing to gain a greater appreciation of Canada’s natural wonders. The Canadian Museum of Nature, Canada’s national natural history museum, continues to author these wonderful books in its goal to inspire a greater understanding of the natural environment.

The Order of Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802039408.jpg,"Its Origins, History, and Developments

Author/Illustrator/Editor: McCreery, Christopher

In 1966, a project to create a national honour for Canadians was begun. The first recipients of the Order of Canada were announced a year later, and in the nearly forty years since, the Order has become a symbol familiar to, and respected by, people from across the country.The spirit that motivates the Order of Canada - celebration, inclusion, and democracy - was born of the memories of Canada’s earlier experience with honours. From initial distrust and misunderstanding to the awakening of a national identity, the development of the Order reflects the relationship Canadians have with their country, their government, their culture, and their heroes. The Order itself is a product of national identity, politics, and history, reflected by the significance of its recipients’ accomplishments. Indeed, the Order’s history is as fascinating as the more than 4000 Canadians who have received it.This first book-length history of the Order of Canada - and first major work on Canadian honours - by Christopher McCreery is a celebration of the Order and a close examination of its unique design and various early incarnations. McCreery provides both a history of the Order’s beginnings and a more general overview of trends in Canadian honours. Extensively illustrated with never-before-published photographs, The Order of Canada: Its Origins, History, and Developments pays tribute to the individuals who felt the need for a system of recognition for Canadians.

The Politics of Taxation in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551113005.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Geoffrey Hale (CA)

Finalist for the 2002 Donner Prize

The balancing of government budgets after years of chronic deficits has reopened public debates over tax levels, the size of government and proposals for tax reform. The Politics of Taxation in Canada explains the factors that have shaped the evolution of Canada’s tax system since the 1960s and the issues that are likely to challenge governments in coming years. It outlines the nature and objectives of Canada’s tax system, the organizational and institutional structures that define and control it, and the political processes that enable politicians to manage policy changes—subject to competing pressures from voters and organized interest groups.

Political scientist Geoffrey Hale describes the major elements of Canada’s tax system as parts of an ""economic constitution"" that affects the daily lives of Canadians as much as the political constitution that defines the powers and limits of governments and the rights of citizens. The principles of Canada’s tax system reflect a loose and evolving political consensus on social and economic priorities. Hale suggests that to be politically and economically workable, proposals for major tax changes ""must begin with the tax system as it is, not as we might wish it to be in the best of all possible worlds.""

The Real Worlds of Canadian Politics,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551115184.jpg,"Cases in Process and Policy, fourth edition

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Leslie Pal (CA), Robert M. Campbell (CA), Michael Howlett (CA)

Fifteen years ago the first edition of The Real Worlds of Canadian Politics was published to wide acclaim in university classrooms across the country. Its case study approach to Canadian politics and public policy was a unique contribution, and its enormous popularity resulted in two more editions in the following five years. In all three editions, interesting and compelling contemporary cases presented policy issues in a deliberately dramatic narrative style, emphasizing the passions, personalities, and unpredictability of Canadian politics. Real Worlds was a widely read companion volume to more traditional textbooks, illustrating the ""real worlds"" of Canadian politics while offering students opportunities for discussion and debate.

This new edition of The Real Worlds of Canadian Politics renews this tradition and the case study approach established by the earlier editions. It zeroes in on five key areas of policy activity at the federal level during the late stages of the Chrétien government and the beginning of the Paul Martin era. The volume considers the political and policy implications of deregulation in two vital industries — airlines and banking — whose claims that ""bigger is better"" in the globalized environment defied the general political desire for increased competition. And the hard politics of trade that have dogged governments since the Free Trade Agreement was signed is covered in a case study of the controversial Canada-US softwood lumber dispute. Highly charged and emotional issues that defy easy or traditional solutions are also addressed, such as those affecting First Nations and women. Case studies examine the real worlds of First Nations land claims as illustrated in one of the most dramatic accomplishments to date — the Nisga’a settlement — and the explosive issue of gun control after the Montreal massacre.

The fourth edition of The Real Worlds of Canadian Politics is a collaborative enterprise, combining an editorial team and a superb research group comprising Karen Lochead, Andrea Migone, and Russell Williams of Simon Fraser University, and Samuel Bottomley of Carleton University.

The Riddle of Human Rights,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551930398.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Gary Teeple (CA)

Published Under the Garamond Imprint

Available in the US through Prometheus Books. 

Demands for ""human rights"" and resistance to their violation are rarely out of the news. Yet their definition is far from a settled matter, their legal status is quite varied, their uses and defence widely inconsistent between jurisdictions, and respect for them is blatantly limited. If it is held that all humans are abstractly equal in the possession of these rights, there is little agreement on anything else about them. The ""human rights"" of the United Nations? Charter and Universal Declaration contain a host of inconsis­tencies and a mixture of truths and untruths that contradict the assumptions of universality and timelessness.

Gary Teeple makes the case that ""human rights"" are peculiar to an historically given mode of production; they comprise the public declaration of the principles of the prevailing property relations. In that they are proclaimed absolute and universal is no different than similar declarations and beliefs about the nature of principles arising in different social formations. Although the tenets underlying ""human rights"" are distinct from pre-capitalist rights in several ways, there is one very significant distinguishing characteristic: implicit within them are goals that are qualitatively different from any relations yet realized in existing social formations.

Confronting the truths of Canada’s Indian residential school system has been likened to waking a sleeping giant. In The Sleeping Giant Awakens, David B. MacDonald uses genocide as an analytical tool to better understand Canada’s past and present relationships between settlers and Indigenous peoples. Based on archival research, extensive interviews with residential school survivors, and officials at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, among others, The Sleeping Giant Awakens offers a unique and timely perspective on the prospects for conciliation after genocide.

The Workers’ Festival,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802038470.jpg,"A History of Labour Day in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Heron, Craig

For most Canadians today, Labour Day is the last gasp of summer fun: the final long weekend before returning to the everyday routine of work or school. But over its century-long history, there was much more to the September holiday than just having a day off.In The Workers’ Festival, Craig Heron and Steve Penfold examine the complicated history of Labour Day from its origins as a spectacle of skilled workers in the 1880s through its declaration as a national statutory holiday in 1894 to its reinvention through the twentieth century. The holiday’s inventors hoped to blend labour solidarity, community celebration, and increased leisure time by organizing parades, picnics, speeches, and other forms of respectable leisure. As the holiday has evolved, so too have the rituals, with trade unionists embracing new forms of parading, negotiating, and bargaining, and other social groups re-shaping it and making it their own. Heron and Penfold also examine how Labour Day’s monopoly as the workers’ holiday has been challenged since its founding, with alternative festivals arising such as May Day and International Women’s Day.The Workers’ Festival ranges widely into many key themes of labour history - union politics and rivalries, radical movements, religion (Catholic and Protestant), race and gender, and consumerism/leisure - as well as cultural history - public celebration/urban procession, urban space and communication, and popular culture. From St. John’s to Victoria, the authors follow the century-long development of the holiday in all its varied forms.

Truth and Indignation,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781442606302.jpg,"Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Indian Residential Schools

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Niezen, Ronald

Truth and Indignation offers the first close and critical assessment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission as it is unfolding. Niezen uses interviews with survivors and oblate priests and nuns, as well as testimonies, texts, and visual materials produced by the Commission to raise important questions: What makes Canada’s TRC different from others around the world? What kinds of narratives are emerging and what does that mean for reconciliation, transitional justice, and conceptions of traumatic memory? What happens to the ultimate goal of reconciliation when a large part of the testimony—that of nuns, priests, and government officials—is scarcely evident in the Commission’s proceedings? Thoughtful, provocative, and uncompromising in the need to tell the “truth” as he sees it, Niezen offers an important contribution to our understanding of TRC processes in general, and the Canadian experience in particular.

Understanding American Politics,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802096715.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Stephen Brooks (CA)

Too often the politics of the United States is taught in a way that ignores the rest of the world. Understanding American Politics takes a different approach than most standard introductory textbooks by situating the United States in a comparative context. The text weaves its analysis around the concept of American exceptionalism—not American superiority, but American difference—a concept that is at least as old as Tocqueville’s monumental study of American democracy. Brooks believes that it is only when we take seriously the values that make America exceptional that we can truly understand politics and governance in the United States. Offering up-to-date coverage of the institutions and processes of American politics (including the 2008 election), Brooks helps students consider how the rest of the world might view and appreciate Americans, their political systems, and their values.

Uneasy Partnership,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551115047.jpg,"The Politics of Business and Government in Canada

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Geoffrey Hale (CA)

Uneasy Partnership unravels the mutually dependent relationship between business and government in Canada. Governments depend on business investment for economic growth vital to the prosperity of their citizens, the generation of tax revenues, and enough public satisfaction to win them periodic re-election. Businesses depend on governments for more-or-less stable sets of rules that are necessary for success. They often look to governments for protection against threats to their well-being and for assistance in competing with other businesses.

Geoffrey Hale begins examining this relationship by considering the influence of political, economic, and societal ideas on the government’s place in the economy along with the history of Canadian economic development. He continues by examining the effects of political and economic structures on the workings of the economy and on relations between business and governments. Finally, Hale discusses the interaction of the political marketplace—including organized business interests and individual businesses—with the policy process, including the influence of interest group politics on public opinion, the role of the courts and tribunals on law and policy, and political parties.

War Crimes and the Culture of Peace,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802084958.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Louise Arbour (CA)

In 1996, Louise Arbour was appointed by the Security Council of the United Nations as Chief Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Reflecting on these experiences, she argues in War Crimes and the Culture of Peace that the level of public awareness and understanding of the significance of these events is minimal in part as a result of the way in which international criminal law is practiced. Justice Arbour contends that previous efforts to unite concepts of international law and criminal law in the practice of these tribunals are evolving, and suggests that the ties between personal criminal accountability and peace should be central to the decisions made in the future concerning procedural models for the permanent International War Crimes Tribunals. As a result, the public might better understand the context and causes of such crime, and the notion of crime as a breach of the peace would be made central to these trials.Justice Arbour delivered War Crimes and the Culture of Peace as the fifth annual Senator Keith Davey Lecture at Victoria University at the University of Toronto in January 2001.

Warming Up to the Cold War,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802096159.jpg,"Canada and the United States' Coalition of the Willing, from Hiroshima to Korea

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Robert Teigrob (CA)

When U.S. President Harry Truman asked his allies for military support in the Korean War, Canada’s government, led by Prime Minister Louis St-Laurent, was reluctant. St-Laurent’s government was forced to change its position however, when the Canadian populace, conditioned to significant degrees by the powerful influence of American media and culture, demanded a more vigorous response. Warming up to the Cold War shows how American cultural influence helped to undermine waning Canadian nationalism.

Comparing Canadian and American responses to events such as the atomic bomb, the Gouzenko Affair, the creation of NATO, and the Korean War, Robert Teigrob traces the role that culture and public opinion played in shaping responses to international affairs. With penetrating political and cultural insight, he examines the Cold War consensus between the two countries to reveal the ways that Canada cited ""home-grown"" rationales to justify its increasing subservience to American strategy and posturing.

Full of fascinating insights, Warming up the Cold War is essential reading for anyone interested in the Cold War, the role of culture in politics, and the history of U.S.-Canada relations.

"Western Visions, Western Futures",,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781551114880.jpg,"Perspectives on the West in Canada, second edition

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Loleen Berdahl (CA), Roger Gibbins (CA)

Western Visions, Western Futures explores the interplay between western alienation and western aspirations. Because of regional optimism, western Canadians often feel alienated from the rest of Canada or, more specifically, from the federal government: western Canadians are concerned that their aspirations are not shared by the rest of Canada and, worse, that conflicting “national”policy choices and political realities have and will work to undermine the interests of the West. The book is rich in both data and history. Combining strong analysis with graphs and illustrative quotations, it presents a comprehensive overview of key western Canadian trends and policy issues and places these within a national context.

Western Visions, Western Futures outlines a number of process and policy options for federal and provincial governments both to help fulfill western aspirations and to address western alienation. The authors argue that the future prosperity and well-being of Canada are integrally tied to the future of the West, and leaving western alienation unaddressed for another 50 or 100 years will only serve to weaken or destroy the whole country.

Western Visions, Western Futures is a revised, updated, and expanded edition of Western Visions by Roger Gibbins and Sonia Arrison (Broadview Press 1995), there is little in common between the two books. Many of the themes are the same, but the new book draws heavily on a wealth of Canada West Foundation data that has recently come available.

When Canadian Literature Moved to New York,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802038289.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Mount, Nick

Canadian literature was born in New York City. It began not in the backwoods of Ontario or the salt flats of New Brunswick, but in the cafés, publishing offices, and boarding houses of late nineteenth-century New York, where writing developed as a profession and where the groundwork for the Canadian canon was laid. So argues Nick Mount in When Canadian Literature Moved to New York.The last decades of the nineteenth century saw an extraordinary exodus from English Canada, draining the country of half its writers and all but a few of its contemporary and future literary celebrities. Motivated by powerful obstacles to a domestic literature, most of these migrants landed in New York - by the 1890s the centre of the continental literary market - and found for the first time a large, receptive literary market and recognition from non-Canadian publishers and reviewers.While the expatriates of the 1880s and 1890s - including Bliss Carman, Ernest Thompson Seton, and Palmer Cox - were recognized for their achievements in Canada, the domestic literature they themselves spurred into existence rekindled a nationalist imperative to distinguish Canadian writing from other literatures, especially American, and this slowly eliminated most of their work from the emerging English Canadian canon. When Canadian Literature Moved to New York is the story of these expatriate writers: who they were, why they left, what they achieved, and how they changed Canadian literary history.

These are stories that have been developed over long periods of time, reproduced in classrooms, anthropology and sociology textbooks, and other media, but have been rarely challenged, contributing to misunderstandings that have ultimately, in subtle ways, diminished the stature of Inuit traditional culture. In this lively book, designed specifically for introductory students, Steckley unpacks three ""White Lies""—the myth that there are fifty-two words for snow, that there are blond, blue-eyed Inuit descended from the Vikings, and that the Inuit send off their elders to die on ice floes. Debunking these popular myths allows him to illustrate how knowledge is shaped by Western social science, particularly the anthropology of the ""Other,"" and that it can be flawed. In the process, students learn not only about Inuit culture, but about the difference between popular and scholarly research.

Why Canadian Unity Matters and Why Americans Care,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802083913.jpg,"Democratic Pluralism at Risk

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Charles F. Doran (CA)

Why is Canadian unity important to democratic pluralism worldwide?Democratic pluralism is the ability of different cultural and language communities to find representation under a single set of democratic institutions, however configured. Although traditional liberal arguments at best ignored culture, in practise, out of a long struggle to eliminate gargantuan prejudices, errors and wrongs, the liberal tradition has created in democratic pluralism a dialectic of culture and liberal politics that resolves the theoretical conundrums so dear to both. Canadian democracy is a monument to success in its capacity to provide dignity, freedom, opportunity, and prosperity to its citizens throughout the polity. Secession, if it takes place in Quebec, puts these achievements at risk, raising the spectre that cultural-linguistic norms, not a mature liberal democracy, will fashion the kind of state that future generations will inherit.Charles Doran examines why Canadian unity is important, what drives Quebec separatism in the American view, the concern that after Quebec succession the rest of Canada could unravel, and the nature of the historical era that has shaped and conditioned secessionist impulse.

Women’s Writing in Canada,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9780802095015.jpg,"Author/Illustrator/Editor: Patricia Demers

Spanning the period from the Massey Commission to the present and reflecting on the media of print, film, and song, this study attends to the burgeoning energy of women writers across genres. It explores how their work interprets our national story. The questioning, disruptive feminist practice of their fiction, filmmaking, poetry, song-writing, drama, and non-fiction reveals the tensions of colonial society at the same time as it transforms cultural life in Canada.

Words Have a Past,,https://livrescanadabooks.com/images/feed/9781487521554.jpg,"The English Language, Colonialism, and the Newspapers of Indian Boarding Schools

Author/Illustrator/Editor: Jane Griffith

For nearly 100 years, Indian boarding schools in Canada and the US produced newspapers read by white settlers, government officials, and Indigenous parents. These newspapers were used as a settler colonial tool, yet within these tightly controlled narratives there also existed sites of resistance. This book traces colonial narratives of language, time, and place from the 19th century to the present day, post-Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
