9781883011017,"John Steinbeck : Novels And Stories, 1932-1937 : The Pastures Of Heaven / To A God Unknown / Tortilla Flat / In Dubious Battle / Of Mice And Men (library Of America)",['John Steinbeck'],"""Deep down it's mine, right to the center of the world,"" says a Salinas Valley farmer about his land in John Steinbeck's To a God Unknown, and Steinbeck the writer could have said the same. From the very start of his career he evoked the landscapes and people of central California with lyrical intensity and unflinching frankness. Through his intimate rendering of that place and those people, he expressed his abiding concerns: community, social justice, and the elemental connection between nature and human society. Here for the first time in one volume are Steinbeck's early California writings. In prose that blends the vernacular and the incantatory, the local and the mythic, these five works chart Steinbeck's evolution into one of the greatest and most enduringly popular of American novelists. The Pastures of Heaven (1932), a collection of interrelated stories, delineates the troubled inner lives and sometimes disastrous fates of families living in a seemingly tranquil California valley. The surface realism of Steinbeck's first mature work is enriched by hints of uncanny forces at work beneath. A sense of primeval magic dominates To a God Unknown (1933), as a California farmer reverts to pagan nature worship and begins a tortuous journey toward catastrophe and ultimate understanding. Steinbeck's sympathetic depiction of the raffish paisanos of Tortilla Flat (1935), a ramshackle district above Monterey, first won him popular attention. The Flat's tenderhearted, resourceful, mildly corrupt, ever-optimistic characters are a triumph of life-affirming humor. In Dubious Battle (1936) plunges into the political struggle of the 1930s, painting a vigorous fresco of a migrant fruit-picker's strike. Anticipating the collective portraiture of The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck poignantly traces the surges and shifts of group behavior. With Of Mice and Men (1937), Steinbeck secured his status as one of the most influential American writers. Lenny and George, itinerant farmhands

                        <p>Here for the first time in one volume are John Steinbeck's early California writings, including Tortilla Flat, his first popular success, and the extraordinarily powerful Of Mice and Men. Featuring many other great works written by Steinbeck from 1932-37, this volume is the first in a projected multi-volume set.

9781891620980,Great White Fathers: The Story Of The Obsessive Quest To Create Mount Rushmore,"['John Taliaferro', 'Taliaferro']","""In Great White Fathers, author John Taliaferro chronicles the heroic struggle to shape the four faces of Rushmore, and then he shows us the warts, too. He reveals the astonishing backstory of America's ""Shrine to Democracy"" - how the Black Hills were snatched from the Lakota Sioux; the grueling and perilous task of carving mammoth faces with dynamite and jackhammers while swinging from a five-hundred-foot cliff; the impact of auto tourism and crass commercialism on the land and lifestyles of the Great Plains."" ""Like so many episodes in the saga of the American West, what began as a personal dream had to be bailed out by the federal government, a compromise that nearly drove Gutzon Borglum over the brink. Nor in the end could Borglum control how his masterpiece would be received by future generations."" Great White Fathers is at once the biography of a man and the biography of a place, told through travelogue, interviews, and investigation of the vast records left behind by one of America's most eccentric, and emblematic, visionaries. It proves that the best American stories are not simple; they are complex and contradictory, at times humorous, at other times tragic."
9781885444264,Degas And The Dance,"['Jill Devonyar', 'Richard Kendall']","""Known in his lifetime as ""the painter of dancers,"" Edgar Degas has long been recognized as the foremost artist of the ballet. More than half of his vast body of work - created over five decades and in all media at his command - is devoted to the activities of dancers, both on and off the stage."" ""Surprisingly, there has never been a comprehensive study of Degas' ballet work in its historical context. Now, in Degas and the Dance, Richard Kendall and Jill DeVoynar place the artist and his work against the backdrop of the Paris Opera, home of the national ballet company. Degas has always been thought of as somewhat detached from the day-to-day life of the dancers he depicted. Kendall and DeVoynar's new research, especially in the Opera archives, reveals that the artist was far more informed about the ballet than has previously been imagined. To an extraordinary extent, Degas' artistic ambitions developed under the roof of the Opera, and his achievements as an artist cannot be wholly grapsed without reference to it."" Degas and the Dance illuminates the world of nineteenth-century ballet and the life of a great artist who was obsessed by his subject. Admirers of dance and of art will be fascinated by this interdisciplinary study. The text and illustrations range across a variety of fascinating topics, including Degas' predecessors and contemporaries, the ballerinas he knew, the nature of classroom training, and the ballet repertoire in his day."

It is a place of year-round beauty with tremendous scientific and ecological importance."" The Holden Arboretum was established on 100 acres in 1931 by people of vision and great generosity who understood the importance of protecting precious green spaces for future generations. Today, Holden spans 3,400 acres and is nationally know for its plant collections, education programs, research efforts, and its commitment to conservation."
9781883124199,Childe Hassam: Impressionist In The West,['Margaret E. Bullock'],"""The renowned American impressionist Childe Hassam built his reputation on light-filled images depicting the streets of New York and New England's coastal resorts. During his sojourns in the West, he painted at least sixty images ranging from portraits and still lifes to landscapes and seascapes in oil, watercolor, and pastel."" Childe Hassam: Impressionist in the West explores this significant, but little known, body of work in the context of the artist's entire oeuvre and larger developments in modern art at the turn of the century. This richly illustrated catalogue investigates how Hassam's images of the West mirror a number of his personal and professional concerns; provides insights into technical aspects of his work, which he tended to adapt to the subject and circumstances at hand; and looks at how the West appealed to the artist's broader interests and concerns, such as his desire to create an art that was purely American in both content and style."
9781885767547,Trial And Triumph: Stories From Church History,['Richard M. Hannula'],"""Thus says the LORD: <i>Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls</i>"" (Jer. 6:16). Christianity is a faith in love with history. God took on human flesh and dwelt among us. The Spirit carried that divine work over the centuries, providing courage and maturity even amid our imperfections.
<p>Christians find their true family line not through tribes and ethnic blood but in the bond of faithfulness and shed blood that has united our family for millennia. We too often view Church history as the story of obscure aliens instead of the lives of brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers.</p>
<p>In this collection of forty-six brief biographies for children, Hannula sketches the stirring trials and triumphs of many famous and some lesser known figures in our family of faith—including Augustine, Charlemagne, Anselm, Luther, Bunyan, and C.S. Lewis. Through them we can begin to enjoy the old paths and find rest for our souls.</p>"
9781885767554,Heroes Of The City Of Man: A Christian Guide To Select Ancient Literature,['Peter J. Leithart'],"""What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?"" For roughly two thousand years, Christians have greatly differed in their answers to Tertullian's pivotal question. Some would have us believe that the ancient Greeks and Romans are responsible for the entire shape and substance of Western culture. Others would prefer to jettison them altogether. Here, Peter Leithart suggests a careful and balanced approach as he analyzes some of the grand classics of ancient literature, including the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Odyssey</i>, the <i>Aeneid</i>, and four prominent Greek dramas. Demonstrating what it means to ""plunder the Egyptians,"" <i>Heroes of the City of Man</i> instructs the reader how we can use the advances of the City of Man to build the City of God."
9781891620515,Royko: A Life In Print,"['Ciccone, F. Richard.']","""When Royko began his career in journalism in the 1950s, newspapers were the sole providers of information, uniquely individual, thriving or failing on their abilities to report faster, write better, and laugh louder than their competitors. Journalism was a tough profession. Police reporters were on the take from mobsters and editors paid more attention to advertisers than to readers. Reporters carried phony police badges and hid pints of bad whiskey in their bottom drawers. They smoked. They drank. And Royko out-wrote the best of them. He insulted and taunted the most vicious killers in Chicago and the most powerful big city boss of the century. He exposed graft and greed. He damned hypocrisy and he defended the little man."" ""Mike Royko was also haunted by conflict. A difficult man, he would intimidate his assistants every morning and retire to the Billy Goat Tavern every night. He was arrogant and kind. He was incomparably witty and suddenly morose. He was vain and insecure. He played hard and he wrote harder and longer than any other newspaperman."" ""Royko: A Life in Print not only tells the story of one of America's greatest newspapermen, but also explores the dramatic developments in journalism and in American society over the course of the twentieth century.""--BOOK JACKET."
9781887896825,Frank Lloyd Wright In Arizona,['Lawrence W. Cheek'],"""Wright fell in love with the desert quickly and profoundly,"" writes Lawrence W. Cheek. ""It was a vast, blank canvas ... it was an open-air warehouse of natural forms, colors, and textures that both delighted and inspired him.""<br>
<br>
Frank Lloyd Wright first came to Arizona in 1928. In this spectacular desert landscape he built his winter headquarters, Taliesin West, and found a passion that drove him for the next 31 years of his life. In the first book to focus solely on Wright's work in Arizona, Lawrence W. Cheek explores the twelve breathtaking buildings that Wright contributed to the state. Cheek also delves into the audacious, mischievous, egocentric, and often outrageous life of Frank Lloyd Wright and examines today's Taliesin West, still a center of vigilant devotion to the man often called the greatest architect of the twentieth century."

<b>The enchanting comic strip that introduced adult readers to the wonderful world of Moomin</b>
<p>Tove Jansson is revered around the world as one of the foremost children's authors of the twentieth century for her illustrated chapter books regarding the magical worlds of her creation, the Moomins. The Moomins saw life in many forms but debuted to its biggest audience ever on the pages of the world's largest newspaper, the <i>London Evening News,</i> in 1954. The strip was syndicated in newspapers around the world with millions of readers in forty countries. <i>Moomin Book One</i> is the first volume of Drawn &amp; Quarterly's publishing plan to reprint the entire strip drawn by Jansson before she handed over the reins to her brother Lars in 1960. This is the first time the strip will be published in any form in North America and will deservedly place Jansson among the international cartooning greats of the last century.</p>
<p>The Moomins are a tight-knit family-hippo-shaped creatures with easygoing and adventurous outlooks. Jansson's art is pared down and precise, yet able to compose beautiful portraits of ambling creatures in fields of flowers or on rock-strewn beaches that recall Jansson's Nordic roots. The comic strip reached out to adults with its gentle and droll sense of humor. Whimsical but with biting undertones, Jansson's observations of everyday life, including guests who overstay their welcome, modern art, movie stars, and high society, easily caught the attention of an international audience and still resonate today.<br>

Volume I lays out the vision of the forest garden and explains the basic ecological principles that make it work. In Volume II, Dave Jacke and Eric Toensmeier move on to practical considerations:concrete ways to design, establish, and maintain your own forest garden.

<b>What is an edible forest garden?</b><br>
An edible forest garden is a perennial polyculture of multipurpose plants. Most plants regrow every year without replanting: perennials. Many species grow together: a polyculture. Each plant contributes to the success of the whole by fulfilling many functions: multipurpose. In other words, a forest garden is an edible ecosystem, a consciously designed community of mutually beneficial plants and animals intended for human food production. Edible forest gardens provide more than just a variety of foods. The seven F's apply here: food, fuel, fiber, fodder, fertilizer, and ""farmaceuticals,"" as well as fun. A beautiful, lush environment can be a conscious focus of your garden design, or a side benefit you enjoy</p>"

We live in an oil-dependent world, arriving at this level of dependency in a very short space of time by treating petroleum as if it were in infinite supply.

As a three-volume curriculum consisting of a <i>Text</i>, <i>Workbook for Students</i>, and <i>Manual for Teachers</i>, it teaches that the way to universal love and peace-or remembering God-is by undoing guilt through forgiving others. The Course thus focuses on the healing of relationships and making them holy. <i>A Course in Miracles</i> also emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum, of which there are many thousands. Consequently, even though the language of the Course is that of traditional Christianity, it expresses a non-sectarian, non-denominational spirituality. <i>A Course in Miracles</i> therefore is a universal spiritual teaching, not a religion.<br><br> The Text presents the theory of the Course and has built into its study the development of the <i>experience</i> of forgiveness that is the Course's goal for the student. In this regard, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> states that its goal for you is happiness and peace. (Text, p. 241) (T-13.II.7:1) The Text also explains the basis for fear and guilt, and how they can be overcome through miracles, which are defined as maximal expressions of love. Miracles are also defined as the shift in perception from fear to love. <p>The Workbook for Students consists of 365 lessons, an exercise for each day of the year. This one-year training program <i>begins</i> the process of changing the student's mind and perception, though it is not intended to bring one's learning to completion.

It also includes clarification of a number of terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the Text and for their practical application through the Workbook.</p><p><i>A Course in Miracles</i> was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman through a process of inner dictation she identified as coming from Jesus. A clinical and research psychologist and tenured Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, she was assisted by Dr. William Thetford, her department head, who was also a tenured Professor of Medical Psychology at the Medical Center where they both worked.</p><p><i>A Course in Miracles</i> was first published in 1975, the year Dr. Schucman assigned copyright of the Course to the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). Since the beginning and as designated, this Foundation has been its publisher, disseminator, and copyright/trademark holder, although in 1999 it assigned the copyright and trademark to the Foundation for <i>A Course in Miracles</i> (FACIM). There are currently about one and a half million copies of the Course in circulation worldwide. Translations in Chinese, Dutch, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish are also available, with twelve other translations now in progress.</p><p>What exactly, then, is <i>A Course in Miracles</i>? The summary introduction, which appears in its Text, is quite succinct and brief. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.</p><p>This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</p><p class=null1>Nothing real can be threatened.<br> Nothing unreal exists.</p><p>Herein lies the peace of God.</p></blockquote>"

Toklas</i>, but this darker and more complex work was long misunderstood and neglected. An account of her experiences as a result of writing a bestseller, <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> is as funny and engaging as <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, but it is also a searing meditation on the meaning of success and identity in America. Posing as the representative American, Stein transforms her story into history—responding to the tradition of Thoreau and Henry Adams, she writes: ""I used to be fond of saying that America, which was supposed to be a land of success, was a land of failure. Most of the great men in America had a long life of early failure and a long life of later failure."" <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> is Stein at her most accessible and her most serious, and may yet prove to be among her most popular books."

<p>Continuing D+Q’s groundbreaking exploration of the fascinating world of <i>Gekiga</i>, this collection of short stories is drawn with great delicacy and told with subtle nuance by the legendary Japanese artist Susumu Katsumata. The setting is the premodern Japanese countryside of the author’s youth, a slightlymagical world where ancestral traditions hold sway over a people in the full vigor of life, struggling to survive the harsh seasons and the difficult life of manual laborers and farmers. While the world they inhabit has faded into memory and myth, the universal fundamental emotions of the human heart prevail at the center of these tender stories.</p>
<p>Katsumata began publishing comic strips in the legendary avantgarde magazine <i>Garo</i> (which also published his contemporaries Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Yoshiharu Tsuge) in 1965 while enrolled in the Faculty of Science in Tokyo. He abandoned his studies in 1971 to become a professional comics artist, alternating the short humorous strips upon which he built his reputation with stories of a more personal nature in which he tenderly depicted the lives of peasants and farmers from his native region. In 2006, Katsumata won the 35th Japanese Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize for <i>Red Snow</i>.</p>"

<p>Acclaimed for his visionary short-story collections <i>The Push Man and Other Stories</i>, <i>Abandon the Old in Tokyo</i>, and <i>Good-Bye</i>—originally created nearly forty years ago, but just as resonant now as ever—the legendary Japanese cartoonist Yoshihiro Tatsumi has come to be recognized in North America as a precursor of today’s graphic novel movement. <i>A Drifting Life</i> is his monumental memoir eleven years in the making, beginning with his experiences as a child in Osaka, growing up as part of a country burdened by the shadows of World War II.</p>
<p>Spanning fifteen years from August 1945 to June 1960, Tatsumi’s stand-in protagonist, Hiroshi, faces his father’s financial burdens and his parents’ failing marriage, his jealous brother’s deteriorating health, and the innumerable pitfalls that await him in the competitive manga market of mid-twentieth-century Japan. He dreams of following in the considerable footsteps of his idol, the manga artist Osamu Tezuka (<i>Astro Boy</i>, <i>Apollo’s Song</i>, <i>Ode to Kirihito</i>, <i>Buddha</i>)—with whom Tatsumi eventually became a peer and, at times, a stylistic rival. As with his short-story collection, <i>A Drifting Life</i> is designed by Adrian Tomine.</p>

In a voice at once coolly detached and utterly confident, we follow Bryan Charles's journey navigating love, work, and family, from the streets of Manhattan to the upper floors of corporate America. This is a gripping meditation on the self, ricocheting between the multitudes and solitude, and between the industrial-turned-residential spaces of Brooklyn and the towers of the World Trade Center, where his life takes an unexpected turn.

9781888451894,Chicago Noir,"['Pollack', 'Neal']","<p>“<i>Chicago Noir</i> is a legitimate heir to the noble literary tradition of the greatest city in America. Nelson Algren and James Farrell would be proud.” —Stephen Elliott, author of <i>Happy Baby</i></p>
<p>“If ever a city was made to be the home of noir, it’s Chicago. These writers go straight to Chicago’s noir heart.” —Aleksandar Hemon, author of <i>Nowhere Man</i></p>
<p>Brand new stories by: Neal Pollack, Achy Obejas, Alexai Galaviz-Budziszewski, Adam Langer, Joe Meno, Peter Orner, Kevin Guilfoile, Bayo Ojikutu, Jeff Allen, Luciano Guerriero, Claire Zulkey, Andrew Ervin, M.K. Meyers, Todd Dills, C.J. Sullivan, Daniel Buckman, Amy Sayre-Roberts, and Jim Arndorfer.</p>
<p>The city of Chicago has spent much time and money over the last decade marketing itself as a tourist-friendly place for the whole family. It's got a shiny new Millennium Park, a spaceship in the middle of Soldier Field, and thousands of identical faux-brick condo buildings that seem to spring from the ground overnight. Chicago's rough-and-tumble tough-guy reputation has been replaced by a postcard with a lake view.</p>
<p>But that city's not gone. The hard-bitten streets once represented by James Farrell and Nelson Algren may have shifted locales, and they may be populated by different ethnicities, but Chicago is still a place where people struggle to survive and where, for many, crime is the only means for their survival. The stories in <i>Chicago Noir</i> reclaim that territory.</p>
<p><b><i>Chicago Noir</i> is populated</b> by hired killers and jazzmen, drunks and dreamers, corrupt cops and ticket scalpers and junkies. It's the Chicago that the Department of Tourism doesn't want you to see, a place where hard cases face their sad fates, and pay for their sins in blood. These are stories about blocks that visitors are afraid to walk. They tell of a Chicago beyond Oprah, Michael Jordan, and deep-dish pizza. This isn't someone's dream of Chicago. It's not even a nightmare. It's just the real city, unfiltered. <i>Chicago Noir</i>.</p>"

In flavorful detail, Clarkson celebrates the pie in all its variations.

9781884836602,Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens (series On Ohio History And Culture),['Steve Love'],"<p>As a boy who grew up in Akron, F. A. Seiberling tramped the fields and woods outside of the city, hunting the area where stone had once been quarried. Even then, the dramatic views of the Cuyahoga Valley, natural vistas that spread before him like paintings, would stop young Frank in his tracks. He never forgot them. Years later, the founder of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company would build Stan Hywet-the Old English term for stone quarry-a sixty-five-room Tudor Revival mansion on seventy acres of meticulously landscaped gardens, orchards, and vistas. The skill and artistry of photographers Ian Adams and Barney Taxel portray the splendor of all four seasons at Stan Hywet, now maintained through the Stan Hywet Hall Foundation. These vivid images depict the restored mansion in its magnificent setting, capturing the springtime charm of mayapples and periwinkle in the Dell, the classic elegance of Gertrude Seiberling's Music Room, and the stark grandeur of snow-covered oaks mirrored in a reflection pool. From spring mornings to Christmas celebrations, Steve Love narrates as the reader strolls through the rooms and halls of the mansion and rambles down the lanes through its magnificent gardens and into the lives of the Seiberlings. With a foreword by F. A.'s grandson, former congressman John F.

9781890951337,Solitary Sex: A Cultural History Of Masturbation,"['Laqueur, Thomas Walter.']","<p>At a time when almost any victimless sexual practice has its public advocates and almost every sexual act is fit for the front page, the easiest, least harmful, and most universal one is embarrassing, discomforting, and genuinely radical when openly acknowledged. Masturbation may be the last taboo. But this is not a holdover from a more benighted age. The ancient world cared little about the subject; it was a backwater of Jewish and Christian teaching about sexuality. In fact, solitary sex as a serious moral issue can be dated with a precision rare in cultural history; Laqueur identifies it with the publication of the anonymous tract Onania in about 1722. Masturbation is a creation of the Enlightenment, of some of its most important figures, and of the most profound changes it unleashed. It is modern. It worried at first not conservatives, but progressives. It was the first truly democratic sexuality that could be of ethical interest for women as much as for men, for boys and girls as much as for their elders.The book's range is vast. It begins with the prehistory of solitary sex in the Bible and ends with third-wave feminism, conceptual artists, and the Web. It explains how and why this humble and once obscure means of sexual gratification became the evil twin — or the perfect instance — of the great virtues of modern humanity and commercial society: individual moral autonomy and privacy, creativity and the imagination, abundance and desire.</p>"

In August 1996, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb stunned the world with a series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News reporting the results of his year-long investigation into the roots of the crack cocaine epidemic in America, specifically in Los Angeles.

Now Gary Webb has pushed his investigation even further in his book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. Drawing from recently declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that have never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities.</p>"

Featuring essays written by scholars at Monticello, chapters focus on all aspects of the house and plantation.

Inside, Jefferson assembled a world-class collection of objects and furnishings: art and porcelain from France, scientific instruments from England, the finest American furniture from Philadelphia and New York, natural artifacts brought back from the West, as well as furnishings made in Monticello's own joinery by enslaved craftsmen.

9781883642433,My Home Is Far Away,"['Powell, Dawn.']","<p>My Home is Far Away is the most precisely autobiographical of Powell’s fifteen novels. In this family chronicle set in early twentieth century Ohio, young Marcia Willard’ s family struggles to keep up with the rapidly changing times, and Marcia endures disillusionment, cruelty, and betrayal to forge a survivor’s sense of independence. John Updike has compared Powell with Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Sherwood Anderson, “and those other Midwestern writers who felt something epic in the national shift from rural to urban, from provincial sequestration to metropolitan liberation.” By 1941, when Powell set to work on My Home Is Far Away, she was better known for the smart, boozy, bawdy, hilarious send-ups of Manhattan high and low life. She had begun to attain a reputation for high sophistication and nothing could be less “sophisticated” – in the glittering, all-knowing, furiously present-tense, big-city manner Powell had perfected – than My Home Is Far Away.<br>
 This was the month of cherries and peaches, of green apples beyond the grape arbor, of little dandelion ghosts in the grass, of sour grass and four-leaf clovers, of still dry heat holding the smell of nasturtiums and dying lilacs. This was the best month of all and the best day. It was not birthday, Easter, Christmas, or picnic, but all these things and something else, something wonderful, something utterly unknown. The two little girls in embroidered white Sunday dresses knew no way to express their secret joy but by whirling each other dizzily over the lawn crying, “We’re moving, we’re moving! We’re moving to London Junction!”<br>
 My Home Is Far Away is one of the very few examples of a book written for adults, with an adult command of the language, that maintains the vantage point of a hungry, serious child throughout. It might be likened to a memoir that has been penned not with the usual tranquility of distance but rather with the sense that everything happening to the characters is happening right now, without any promise of eventual escape, without any assurance that childhood, too, shall pass away.<br>
 My Home is Far Away had been out of print for sixty years when Steerforth reissued it in 1995. It received immediate widespread acclaim, and was featured on the cover of the New York Times Book Review.</p>"

Because of it he meets Monika Grzelka, a young journalist whose charms prove difficult to resist, and he discovers the frightening power of certain esoteric therapeutic methods.

9781884519017,Occupy (occupied Media Pamphlet Series),['Noam Chomsky'],"<p>PRAISE FOR NOAM CHOMSKY'S <i>OCCUPY</i> AND ZUCCOTTI PARK PRESS:</p>
<p>“Having spent so much time thinking about and engaging with social movements, Chomsky is both optimistic about the energy of Occupy and realistic about the challenges it faces. He appreciates the “just do it” ethos and embraces its radical approach to participatory democracyWhat makes Chomsky’s perspective so interesting, aside from the wealth of his political experience, is the range of his interests. He draws from examples around the world to demonstrate his points. ...It’s a big agenda that Occupy has identified, nothing less than a complete renewal of U.S. society and the U.S. role in the world. Chomsky sees not only the radical agenda but also the radical practice of the Occupiers. “Part of what functioning, free communities like the Occupy communities can be working for and spreading to others is just a different way of living, which is not based on maximizing consumer goods, but on maximizing values that are important for life,” he concludes in this valuable set of remarks and interviews.”<br>
<b>—John Feffer, Foreign Policy in Focus, Pick Review</b></p>
<p>“For decades, Chomsky has been marginalized for his insightful, levelheaded, and accurate observations about how our society functions. In <i>Occupy</i>, Chomsky... sets the record straight. And he’s got an answer for everything. “It’s necessary,” Chomsky warns, “to get out into the country and get people to understand what this is about, and what they can do about it, and what the consequences are of not doing anything about it.” <i>Occupy</i> begins with a powerful editor’s note from Greg Ruggiero, who comments on ‘the heartlessness and inhumanity of the system,’ where ‘people’s stolen homes are sold off to the highest bidder.’ And if it isn’t obvious to those who are still asking what the demands of Occupy Wall Street are, Ruggiero puts it plainly: ‘Occupy embodies a vision of democracy that is fundamentally antagonistic to the management of society as a corporate-controlled space that funds a political system to serve the wealthy, ignore the poor.’ One can only cringe at the thought of what will happen if we continue to ignore the wisdom of Noam Chomsky. He gives a clue in <i>Occupy</i>.”<br>
<b>—The Coffin Factory, The Magazine for People who Love Books</b></p>
<p><i>Occupy</i> is another vital contribution from Chomsky to the literature of defiance and protest, and a red-hot rallying call to forge a better, more egalitarian future.""<br>
<b>—Alternet</b></p>
<p>Chomsky advocates intelligent activism by those who see the divorce between public policy and public opinion. He is both optimistic and realistic towards this “first major public response to 30 years of class war.”<br>
<b>—IRISH TIMES, PICK REVIEW</b></p>
<p>“<i>Occupy</i>, is at once a vivid portrait of the now-global movement and a practical guide to intelligent activism, infused with Chomsky’s signature meditations on everything from how the wealthiest 1% came to steer society to what a healthy democracy would look like to how we can separate money from politics. Alongside Chomsky’s words are some of the most moving and provocative photographs from the Occupy movement. ... [One of] 10 essential books on protest.”<br>
<b>—Maria Popova, Brain Pickings</b></p>
<p>In <i>Occupy</i>, Chomsky discusses the cornerstone issues, questions and demands that have been driving ordinary Americans to critique the influence of the ""1%."" The book begins and ends with Chomsky celebrating the life and work of his longtime friend and colleague, Howard Zinn, author of <i>A People’s History of the United States.</i> As a call to action, Chomsky encourages people to continue organizing, to continue struggling, and to continue defending citizenship and community-driven democracy from predation from the relentless encroachments of wealth and corporate power.</p>"

He is most attentive to the subtle psychological working of our human ego, marshaling resources for his Islamic tradition that can confront and overcome it. The result of desisting from claiming as our right and ability what is clearly beyond our control is illumination of the heart, clarity of the mind, and tranquility of the soul. This new translation masterfully illustrates the goal of Ibn Ata' Allah's discussion of achieving inner illumination of the heart, which is close to the sense of ""enlightenment"" that has become common in English language discussions of spirituality and gnosis.</p>"

9781892145383,Literary Paris: A Guide,['Jessica Powell'],"For centuries Paris was the destination of writers from the provinces and from across the ocean, and the city swiftly became an integral part of the lives and work of those who went there. <i>Literary Paris</i> profiles thirty writers and the apartments, cafes, bistros, theaters, museums, and other places central to their daily lives and featured in their work.
<p><i>Literary Paris</i> opens with Moliere, whose farces lampooning man’s vanity and hypocrisy delighted the royal courts. In the next century, we glimpse the destitute Zola, so hungry that he ate sparrows caught on his windowsill, and the perpetually bankrupt Balzac who, hoping to evade creditors, required friends to give a secret phrase–“Apple season has arrived” or “I come with lace from Belgium”–to gain admittance into his quarters.</p>
<p>Among the twentieth-century writers profiled are Georges Simenon, creator of wildly popular detective novels, who in Paris began an affair with the sensational Josephine Baker; F. Scott Fitzgerald, who, instead of finding the “new rhythm” he sought, burned through his money and talent in the City of Light; as well as Henry Miller, George Orwell, James Baldwin.</p>
<p>Women writers include the scandalous Colette; George Sand, friend of Lizst and lover of Chopin; and the sophisticated <i>New Yorker</i> correspondent Janet Flanner.</p>
<p>Great city landmarks are here, including Notre Dame Cathedral, where Quasimodo imprisoned Esmerelda in Victor Hugo’s masterpiece, and the Louvre, where in 1911 the <i>Mona Lisa</i> vanished in a scandal that ruined the poet Guillame Apollinaire. Also featured are the beloved cafes integral to the city’s culture, such as Café Flore, where Simone de Beauvoir claimed a spot by the stove each morning to write while her lover, Jean-Paul Sartre, was off at war.</p>"

What is gluten? Why can't I eat cake, cookies, and chicken nuggets like everyone else? What do I tell my friends? Answers to these and many other questions are provided in <i>EATING GLUTEN-FREE WITH EMILY</i>. Written by the mother of a child with celiac disease, who also has the disease herself, this book offers a reassuring look at celiac disease in language that a child can easily understand.<br>
 <br>
This fictional story is based on the real-life experiences many newly diagnosed children face. Five-year-old Emily and her parents wonder why she's not feeling well. Her belly is swollen, and she feels moody and sick. A trip to the doctor raises some concerns and further tests show that Emily has celiac disease. Emily talks about what food she can and cannot eat, how her Mom buys special gluten-free food, and the need to stay on a gluten-free diet at restaurants, birthday parties, friends' houses, school, and camp. <br>
<br>
With its lighthearted, colorful illustrations, <i>EATING GLUTEN-FREE WITH EMILY</i> helps children see that having celiac disease is not so scary after all. Emily acknowledges that having celiac disease is sometimes tough, but talking about her feelings with her mom always makes her feel better. She knows that celiac disease is only part of who she is--she also likes to jump rope, paint, tell jokes, and pick flowers! This book's positive message will be a huge boost to children with celiac disease, especially those who have been recently diagnosed."

Davis and Johnston bring to Ibsen a fresh combination of scholarly insight and a sense of what communicates in the theater. Too often Ibsen in English ends up sounding like a quaint Victorian parlor dramatist. These texts capture some things that are often missed - the wit and humor, the purposeful use of certain repeated images, and the sense of daring that helped make Ibsen a revolutionary figure not just for the 19th Century, but for all time to come."

In The Amateur Armies, Symonds describes the civilian volunteer armies that slugged it out at Bull Run and Shiloh. The Second Section, The Organized War, details the emergence of great war figures like George B. McClellan and Robert E. Lee.

9781891024375,Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting,"['Robert Storr', 'Gerhard Richter']","Gerhard Richter is one of the most influential painters working today. Since the early 1960s, his work has received much attention and many international accolades. Richter's diverse body of work calls into question such widely held assumptions as the importance of stylistic consistency, individual artistic sensibility, spontaneous creativity, and the impact of technology and media imagery to traditional studio methods and formats. Unlike many artists today, he has explored these issues mainly through the medium of painting, challenging it to meet the demands posed by new forms of conceptual art. His varied output ranges from austere photo-based figurative realism of the early 1960s to brightly colored gestural abstractions of the early 1980s and encompasses such startling works as his brilliant cycle of black-and-white paintings of the Baader-Meinhof group, thought-provoking monochrome abstractions and banal Pop images, delicate landscapes and intimate portraits. As an artist, Richter has assumed a critical distance from vanguardists and conservatives alike regarding what painting should be; and the result has been a vital renewal of painting itself. This book accompanies the first comprehensive exhibition of the seventy-year-old German artist's paintings ever to appear in New York and includes beautiful color plates and duotones of some two hundred canvases in a broad representation of his forty years of painting. In addition, this volume contains a substantial recent interview with Richter, a chronology, selected bibliography, and comprehensive exhibition history. The retrospective this book accompanies was organized by Robert Storr, Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. After its showing in New York, this extraordinary exhibition will be seen in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C."

However, God says much more in the Bible about husbands loving their wives than He says about wives submitting to their husbands. He created marriage to be a picture of the relationship between Christ and the Church. Christ was willing to sacrifice His life for the Church, and God expects no less from husbands today. The overall purpose of The Exemplary Husband is to assist husbands toward purposeful and lasting Christlikeness for the glory of God. It was written to be a companion book for The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace.

How can the school environment be improved so that teachers and staff feel confident, respected and safe? The Well-Managed Classroom can show you how to overhaul or enhance the social climate and build a true community in your school.<br> The authors describe the Girls and Boys Town Education Model, a school-based intervention strategy that emphasizes behavior management practices, relationship-building techniques, and social skills instruction. It offers you the structure and strategies needed to reduce disruptive behaviors and empower students with self-management skills. The Model has been implemented in hundreds of schools and school districts nationwide. Research shows that in classrooms where the Model is implemented with high fidelity, more students comply with teacher correction and stay academically engaged while office discipline referrals and student suspension days decline.<br> The benefits of social skills instruction, coupled with proactive classroom management (having rules, procedures, and consistent consequences) cannot be underestimated. When students are motivated to learn, when they feel good about the classroom environment and the relationships they have with teachers and staff, when they can manage themselves and accept responsibility for their behavior, and when they feel empowered to improve, only then can you effectively teach and students truly learn.<br> The authors, from the National Resource and Training Center at Girls and Boys Town, have many years of experience teaching and training teachers and school administrators to successfullyimplement the Education Model."

Not since 1911 has there been a comprehensive collection of poems written about Ohio. And this anthology is especially relevant as Ohio celebrates its 200th year as a state. It could be called Ohio's bicentennial gift to itself. These poems, written by such celebrated Ohio natives as James Wright and Mary Oliver, and by accomplished if less well known poets like Ruth L. Schwartz and Rachel Langille, offer a virtual tour of people and places in the state, traveling around Ohio's lakes and rivers, farms and open country, small towns and large cities. In resonant language and compelling imagery, in shapely verse and lines responsive to the moment's impulse, the poems bring Ohio to its citizens and, beyond the borders of the state, to lovers of poetry everywhere. The perspective may be personal or historical, close-up or wide-ranging, celebratory or otherwise, but each poem becomes part of the state's legacy passed on to future generations, a collective record of how Ohio appears to itself and to others at the beginning of the 21st century."

One of the most influential writers of the century, her novels and stories blend the storytelling tradition of the South with a modernist sensibility attuned to the mysteries and ambiguities of experience. Welty explores the complex abundance of southern, and particularly southern women's, lives with an artistry that Salman Rushdie has called impossible to overpraise. Complete Novels gathers all of Welty's longer fiction in one volume for the first time. In The Robber Bridegroom (1942), based on a Grimm fairy tale, legendary figures from Mississippi's past, such as the keel-boat captain Mike Fink and the savage outlaws the Harp Brothers, mingle with Welty's own imaginings in a free-ranging and boisterous fantasy set along the Natchez Trace. The richly textured Delta Wedding (1946), set against a backdrop of rural Mississippi in the 1920s, vividly portrays the intricacies of family relationships in its account of the sprawling Fairchild clan. Edna Earle Ponder's unrestrained and delightfully absurd monologue, superb in its capturing of the rhythms of country speech, shows Welty's humor at its idiomatic best in The Ponder Heart (1954), a flight of invention culminating in a murder trial that becomes an occasion for exuberant comedy. The monumental Losing Battles (1970), composed over fifteen years, brings Welty's imaginative gifts to the largest canvas of her career, rendering a Depression-era family reunion with mythic scope and ebullient comic vigor. The volume concludes with The Optimist's Daughter (1972), a taut and moving story of a woman rediscovering the world of her childhood as she comes to terms with her father's death. Often considered her masterpiece, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1972."

Craige's purpose in writing this very entertaining book is not only to report and explain her parrot's acquisition of language and cognitive abilities, but also-through Cosmo's story-to awaken readers to the mental activities of all the animals with whom we humans share space on our planet. The book has a preface by Irene Pepperberg, author of Alex and Me, and two appendices: a list of ""Cosmo's utterances"" and a list of ""Forty-Four Tips for Living with an African Grey.""

Cherkovski draws on personal encounters to create biographical portraits that are engaging and animated.

A city split for forty years by the Wall is trying to knit itself back together -- a city where former Stasi men and their victims now pass one another in the street, and where, just under the surface, the Nazi past now lies buried. When Anna Funder hears of ordinary people who resisted the fearsome Stasi -- the Communist regime's secret police -- she sets out to investigate the extraordinary stories from the underbelly of the most perfected surveillance state of all time, the former East Germany. Funder finds Miriam Weber, imprisoned as a teenager after scaling the Berlin Wall, and Frau Paul, who never, ever wanted to be a hero. She visits the regime's cartographer, obsessed to this day with the Wall; she gets drunk with the legendary ""Mik Jegger"" of the east, rock star Klaus Renft, who was once declared by the authorities to ""no longer exist."" Then she finds former Stasi men, now coping with the end of their world -- men who spied on their families and friends, who irradiated people in order to keep track of them or stole pieces of their underwear to store in jars as ""smell samples."" A fiercely talented new writer, Funder has a novelist's eye for character and story.

New nature games - favorites from the field - and Cornell's typically insightful commentary makes the second edition of this special classic even more valuable to nature lovers world-wide. The Sharing Nature movement that Cornell pioneered has now expanded to countries all over the globe. Recommended by Boy Scouts of America, American Camping Association, National Audubon Society and many others.
<p>Author Biography: Cornell is one of the most highly regarded nature educators in the world today. Being with him in nature is a memorable event because of his obvious joy being in nature and his love for the Earth. In the late 1970s, Cornell's book introduced ``nature games"" in which nature is the teacher games that inform, inspire, and are just plain fun. Almost two decades later, with about 500,000 copies of Sharing Nature with Children sold in 15 languages, and many thousands of his other books, ``Sharing Nature"" has become not just a book, but a worldwide approach to nature education. Cornell says, ``I wrote my first book, Sharing Nature with Children because I passionately wanted others to know about these wonderful games, and this exciting way of teaching. Since the book's publication, it's been a joy to see thousands of people embrace its activities and philosophy with enthusiasm equal to mine."" Why such universal appeal? ``I believe it's because in addition to teaching ecology creatively,"" Cornell says, ``these games help people experience a profound sense of joy, serenity, and belonging to the natural world. Nature activities help people to tune into something very deep inside themselves. The games provide a wonderful glimpse into another way of being.""</p>

Jablonski', 'Vicki Madaus Knapp', 'Marcus L Thomeer']","Learning self-help skills-eating, dressing, toileting, and personal hygiene-can be challenging for people with autism, but is essential for independence. <i>Self-Help Skills for People with Autism</i> thoroughly describes a systematic approach that parents (and educators) can use to teach basic self-care to children, ages 24 months to early teens, and even older individuals. With an encouraging tone, the authors-behavior<br>
analysts and psychologists-emphasize that it's worthwhile to devote the extra time and effort now to teach skills rather than have your child be forever dependent on others. <br>
 
<p><br>
The many case studies throughout <i>Self-Help Skills</i> depict individuals with deficits in specific self-care tasks, and demonstrate how a coordinated and systematic approach is effective in teaching more complex skills. For example, a 12-old with the self-feeding skills of a toddler, who was excluded from the school cafeteria, is taught to stay at the table to eat a full meal using utensils. The book's beginning chapters explain the teaching process in detail:</p>
<p>Specify the target skill to be taught after prioritizing the self-care tasks that are most important and will likely have the greatest success rate</p>
<p>-Use task analysis to break complex skills into a series of small steps that will later be<br>
 linked together to form the more complex skill<br>
<br>
-Apply a systematic approach to instruction that consistently employs proven methods for<br>
 teaching people with autism including verbal prompting, reinforcers/rewards, chaining,<br>
 graduated guidance, shaping, modeling, visual supports, etc.<br>
<br>
-Monitor progress by collecting and analyzing data<br>
<br>
-Modifyyour approach as needed to achieve the target goal</p>
<p>A chapter is devoted to each of the four skill areas (eating, dressing, toileting, personal hygiene) offering detailed insight and specific instruction strategies. Appendices contain forms to complete for task analyses, instructional plans, and data collection. With the information in <i>Self-Help Skills</i>, parents can immediately start teaching their child, or refer back to the book to fine-tune skills as their child develops.</p>

The children have mixed feelings—they're excited to be beginning this voyage to a better life and sad to be leaving their old lives behind. They are Jewish, as are almost all of the 937 passengers on board, and although war has not been officially declared in Europe, the Nazis have been persecuting Jews for years. As they set sail for Cuba, the atmosphere on the ship is optimistic, led by the German captain Gustave Shröder, who is determined to see his passengers to safety. But as they learn that Hitler's propaganda has turned the country against them, the mood changes to despair. They are turned away—first from Cuba, then the United States, and then Canada. 
<p>The story of Lisa and Sol is set against the tragic true history of the St. Louis.

Chambers Stevens, Los Angeles' premiere kids acting coach, introduces young actors to the joys and how-to's of performing monologues in preparation of auditions and classroom oral language presentations. More than 50 kid-friendly monologues are incorporated. Each monologue is named and subtitled for quick content perusal. A glossary of up-to-date industry terms, index and bibliography of magnificent performances by child actors in film are also included as a study and motivation aid. In the foreword, Steven Woolf, renowned repertory theater director, discusses the role of monologues in the development of today's actor. Monologues in the book are all original, easy to read, easy to understand, require a minimum of props and work in impromptu settings. Perfect for teachers of theater arts and language arts/speech, parents and counselors interested in increasing the self-confidence and self esteem of young people through the performance arts. Great for classroom, variety talent shows, parties, competitions, and ultimately, auditions. 
<p>There are many techniques used by parents, teachers and agents of social services to provide young people with tools they can utilize to promote self esteem and build self confidence. None are quite so affective as those which encompass the performing arts. Children are performers, almost by definition. They process their ever-changing, ever-growing world view by ""acting out"" what they see, hear, absorb. This makes the performing arts ideal for children. They become free to express attitudes, mannerisms and ways of being which they see as defining both themselves, as they are, and themselves, as they wish they could be. Our title, Magnificent Monologues for Kids, affords the curious child the opportunity for self-motivated expression. All the monologues were tested with kids; all absolutely loved performing them. Why? Chamber's unique ability to tap into the mindset of his students and express their world view, their way. These monologues, and the advice offered by Chambers, become pocketpals for avid student thespians. In the end, it's the realism kids hear expressed in his words that they clamor to act out in their own voice, in their own way. These monologues then are not only catalysts for confidence-building experiences, but also agents for building self esteem through the hands-on orientation endemic to the performing arts. As a publisher of quality material for children, we couldn't be more pleased to present this series, Hollywood 101, and its first title, Magnificent Monologues for Kids. Look for The Ultimate Commercial Book for Kids and Teens, too, and see just how much we can say in five short sentences!</p>

<p>The term ""Modern African Art"" is not an abuse of language. The 20th century has seen, but not properly documented, the birth, development, and maturation of contemporary art in sub-Saharan Africa, an art which was not simply imported in the 1950s but which finds its sources both in colonial realities and in local cultures and civilizations. ""Anthology of African Art: The Twentieth Century"" does not propose to document any one African art, but rather to open up this vast but underexplored field to include a diverse theoretical, historical, geographical, and critical map of this dense and ancient region. Contributions by more than 30 international authors recount the birth of art schools in the 1930s, the development of urban design and public art, and the importance of socially-concerned art during the Independence movements. From Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the Belgian Congo to Ghana, Senegal, and Angola, through the works of hundreds of artists working in every conceivable medium and context, this anthology manages the continental and unique feat of providing a thorough, expansive, diversified, and fully illustrated history of African art in the 20th century.<br>
Since 1991, Paris-based Revue Noire Editions has dedicated itself to the multidisciplinary artistic production of the African continent and the African diaspora. Publishers of the critically-acclaimed ""An Anthology of African Photography"", a comprehensive chronicle of African photography from the mid-1800s to the present, Revue Noire also produces a self-titled magazine devoted to contemporary African art and culture.

From her well-remembered New Yorker essays about the financial demands of big-city ambition and the ethereal, strangely old-fashioned allure of cyber relationships to her dazzlingly hilarious riff in Harper's about musical passions that give way to middle-brow paraphernalia, Daum delves into the center of things while closely examining the detritus that spills out along the way. She speaks to questions at the root of the contemporary experience, from the search for authenticity and interpersonal connection in a society defined by consumerism and media; to the disenchantment of working in a ""glamour profession""; to the catastrophic effects of living among New York City's terminal hipsters. With precision and well-balanced irony, Daum implicates herself as readily as she does the targets that fascinate and horrify her. In a review of The KGB Bar Reader, in which Daphne Merkin singled out Daum's essay about the inability to mourn a friend's death, Merkin wrote: ""It's brutally quick, the way this happens, this falling in love with a writer's style.

9781890612108,Wheatgrass: Superfood For A New Millennium,['Li Smith'],"More than just a grain, wheatgrass has tremendous health and healing properties. As a primary “sun-food,” it converts the sun’s rays directly into chlorophyll as well as an abundance of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and enzymes—all of which are needed to optimize well-being. <i>Wheatgrass</i> describes the outstanding therapeutic benefits of consuming wheatgrass juice. Included are home usage suggestions and growing instructions, as well as a cleansing and rejuvenation program that incorporates wheatgrass, fresh fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, herbs, and edible flowers."
9781890627478,Visual Supports For People With Autism: A Guide For Parents And Professionals (topics In Autism),"['Marlene J. Cohen', 'Donna L. Sloan']","Most of us use visual supports in our daily lives-for example, a shopping list, calendar, or a roadmap. Visual supports are particularly beneficial to people with autism because they help make abstract concepts concrete and capitalize on the user's inherent visual learning strengths. 
<p><i>Visual Supports for People with Autism</i> shows parents and educators how incorporating these aids while teaching can improve academic performance, behavior, interaction with others, and self-help skills. In a friendly, conversational-style, the authors, both certified behavior analysts, describe the deficits typical of autism-language, memory, temporal sequential skills, attention, motivation, and social skills-and present strategies to use visual supports to address those issues at school and home. This guide presents an abundance of examples, illustrated by dozens of black &amp; white and color photos, including:</p>
<p>activity schedules<br>
calendars<br>
charts<br>
checklists<br>
color coding<br>
flip books<br>
graphic organizers<br>
mnemonics<br>
nametags<br>
photo boards<br>
Power Cards<br>
scripts<br>
Social Stories<br>
to-do lists<br>
video modeling</p>
<p><i>Visual Supports</i> also explains considerations such as portability, durability, preferences, age appropriateness, and effectiveness. While visual supports can enhance learning, they should, however, eventually be eliminated to avoid over-dependence on them. An entire chapter describes different ways to fade visual supports.</p>
<p>With this book, there's no limit to what can be taught, from fostering social interaction by using a graphic organizer of conversational talking points to learning to put away toys from video modeling. Most of the visual supportspresented in this book are low-tech and easy-to-use, making it simple for parents and professionals to create their own, suited to the needs of their students. Inspiring success stories will further motivate parents and professionals to get started.</p>

9781862042223,Mother Teresa,['Navin Chawla'],"Mother Teresa's name immediately conjures up a vision of a small, frail woman in a white sari, offering love and compassion to the poorest of the poor who live in the slums of Calcutta, in cardboard boxes in London, in the ghettos of New York, and in the shadow of the Vatican itself. In recognition of her unique work, the world has lavished on her its highest honors and awards, from the Nobel Peace Prize to the Order of Merit presented by Queen Elizabeth. These she has accepted only in the name of the poor, whom she and her Missionaries of Charity so devotedly serve - 'I am but a pencil in the hands of the Lord, it is his work', she has repeatedly said. Starting out with no resources or preconceived ideas, armed only with her faith, Mother Teresa has created an enormously successful religious order that has spread to over a hundred countries, setting up institutions for the destitute, the handicapped, orphans, the leprosy-affected and the dying. Yet her main work remains in the midst of the slums and the dirt of the streets."

9781892145970,"Zuppe: Soups From The Kitchen Of The American Academy In Rome, Rome Sustainable Food Project",['Mona Talbott'],"Much more than a collection of remarkable soups, Mona Talbott’s <i>Zuppe</i> is also a wise and gentle tutorial on the “the beauty and delicious rewards of frugality” and how the humblest foods can be the most profoundly satisfying. In addition to 50 recipes, Talbott shares approaches and techniques that can change the way a cook thinks about economy, improvisation, and using all the flavors and nutrients inherent in each ingredient.
<p>A Chez Panisse graduate, Talbott was chosen by Alice Waters to be Executive Chef of the innovative Rome Sustainable Food Project at the American Academy in Rome. There, while cooking for the Academy’s creative community of scholars, historians, artists, archaeologists, and architects, Talbott perfected a repertoire of dishes made from local, seasonal, organic ingredients. Central to the menu are soups.</p>
<p>Inspired by the traditions of cucina povera, the so-called “cuisine of the poor” that has been the source of so many brilliant Italian dishes, Talbott’s recipes waste nothing, employ the concept of arrangiarsi (“making do”), and skillfully transform leftovers. And, in another nod to the wisdom and economy of traditional kitchens, she also points out which soups can easily be made into one-dish meals with the addition of a single ingredient such as a poached egg, a piece of grilled toast, or even clams.</p>
<p>Organized seasonally, <i>Zuppe</i> also serves as a practical guide to using the bounty of farmers markets throughout the year.</p>"
