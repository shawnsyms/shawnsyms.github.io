"John Steinbeck : Novels And Stories, 1932-1937 : The Pastures Of Heaven / To A God Unknown / Tortilla Flat / In Dubious Battle / Of Mice And Men (library Of America)",John Steinbeck,"""Deep down it's mine, right to the center of the world,"" says a Salinas Valley farmer about his land in John Steinbeck's To a God Unknown, and Steinbeck the writer could have said the same. From the very start of his career he evoked the landscapes and people of central California with lyrical intensity and unflinching frankness. Through his intimate rendering of that place and those people, he expressed his abiding concerns: community, social justice, and the elemental connection between nature and human society. Here for the first time in one volume are Steinbeck's early California writings. In prose that blends the vernacular and the incantatory, the local and the mythic, these five works chart Steinbeck's evolution into one of the greatest and most enduringly popular of American novelists. The Pastures of Heaven (1932), a collection of interrelated stories, delineates the troubled inner lives and sometimes disastrous fates of families living in a seemingly tranquil California valley. The surface realism of Steinbeck's first mature work is enriched by hints of uncanny forces at work beneath. A sense of primeval magic dominates To a God Unknown (1933), as a California farmer reverts to pagan nature worship and begins a tortuous journey toward catastrophe and ultimate understanding. Steinbeck's sympathetic depiction of the raffish paisanos of Tortilla Flat (1935), a ramshackle district above Monterey, first won him popular attention. The Flat's tenderhearted, resourceful, mildly corrupt, ever-optimistic characters are a triumph of life-affirming humor. In Dubious Battle (1936) plunges into the political struggle of the 1930s, painting a vigorous fresco of a migrant fruit-picker's strike. Anticipating the collective portraiture of The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck poignantly traces the surges and shifts of group behavior. With Of Mice and Men (1937), Steinbeck secured his status as one of the most influential American writers. Lenny and George, itinerant farmhands

                        <p>Here for the first time in one volume are John Steinbeck's early California writings, including Tortilla Flat, his first popular success, and the extraordinarily powerful Of Mice and Men. Featuring many other great works written by Steinbeck from 1932-37, this volume is the first in a projected multi-volume set.

Great White Fathers: The Story Of The Obsessive Quest To Create Mount Rushmore,"John Taliaferro', 'Taliaferro","""In Great White Fathers, author John Taliaferro chronicles the heroic struggle to shape the four faces of Rushmore, and then he shows us the warts, too. He reveals the astonishing backstory of America's ""Shrine to Democracy"" - how the Black Hills were snatched from the Lakota Sioux; the grueling and perilous task of carving mammoth faces with dynamite and jackhammers while swinging from a five-hundred-foot cliff; the impact of auto tourism and crass commercialism on the land and lifestyles of the Great Plains."" ""Like so many episodes in the saga of the American West, what began as a personal dream had to be bailed out by the federal government, a compromise that nearly drove Gutzon Borglum over the brink. Nor in the end could Borglum control how his masterpiece would be received by future generations."" Great White Fathers is at once the biography of a man and the biography of a place, told through travelogue, interviews, and investigation of the vast records left behind by one of America's most eccentric, and emblematic, visionaries. It proves that the best American stories are not simple; they are complex and contradictory, at times humorous, at other times tragic."
Degas And The Dance,"Jill Devonyar', 'Richard Kendall","""Known in his lifetime as ""the painter of dancers,"" Edgar Degas has long been recognized as the foremost artist of the ballet. More than half of his vast body of work - created over five decades and in all media at his command - is devoted to the activities of dancers, both on and off the stage."" ""Surprisingly, there has never been a comprehensive study of Degas' ballet work in its historical context. Now, in Degas and the Dance, Richard Kendall and Jill DeVoynar place the artist and his work against the backdrop of the Paris Opera, home of the national ballet company. Degas has always been thought of as somewhat detached from the day-to-day life of the dancers he depicted. Kendall and DeVoynar's new research, especially in the Opera archives, reveals that the artist was far more informed about the ballet than has previously been imagined. To an extraordinary extent, Degas' artistic ambitions developed under the roof of the Opera, and his achievements as an artist cannot be wholly grapsed without reference to it."" Degas and the Dance illuminates the world of nineteenth-century ballet and the life of a great artist who was obsessed by his subject. Admirers of dance and of art will be fascinated by this interdisciplinary study. The text and illustrations range across a variety of fascinating topics, including Degas' predecessors and contemporaries, the ballerinas he knew, the nature of classroom training, and the ballet repertoire in his day."
Holden Arboretum (series On Ohio History And Culture),Steve Love,"""The Holden Arboretum is a living museum of forests and woodlands, meadows and display gardens, mountains and ravines, rock ledges and lakes, rivers and streams, wetlands and bogs, with an abundance of wildlife. It is a place of year-round beauty with tremendous scientific and ecological importance."" The Holden Arboretum was established on 100 acres in 1931 by people of vision and great generosity who understood the importance of protecting precious green spaces for future generations. Today, Holden spans 3,400 acres and is nationally know for its plant collections, education programs, research efforts, and its commitment to conservation."
Childe Hassam: Impressionist In The West,Margaret E. Bullock,"""The renowned American impressionist Childe Hassam built his reputation on light-filled images depicting the streets of New York and New England's coastal resorts. During his sojourns in the West, he painted at least sixty images ranging from portraits and still lifes to landscapes and seascapes in oil, watercolor, and pastel."" Childe Hassam: Impressionist in the West explores this significant, but little known, body of work in the context of the artist's entire oeuvre and larger developments in modern art at the turn of the century. This richly illustrated catalogue investigates how Hassam's images of the West mirror a number of his personal and professional concerns; provides insights into technical aspects of his work, which he tended to adapt to the subject and circumstances at hand; and looks at how the West appealed to the artist's broader interests and concerns, such as his desire to create an art that was purely American in both content and style."
Trial And Triumph: Stories From Church History,Richard M. Hannula,"""Thus says the LORD: <i>Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk in it; then you will find rest for your souls</i>"" (Jer. 6:16). Christianity is a faith in love with history. God took on human flesh and dwelt among us. The Spirit carried that divine work over the centuries, providing courage and maturity even amid our imperfections.
<p>Christians find their true family line not through tribes and ethnic blood but in the bond of faithfulness and shed blood that has united our family for millennia. We too often view Church history as the story of obscure aliens instead of the lives of brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers.</p>
<p>In this collection of forty-six brief biographies for children, Hannula sketches the stirring trials and triumphs of many famous and some lesser known figures in our family of faith—including Augustine, Charlemagne, Anselm, Luther, Bunyan, and C.S. Lewis. Through them we can begin to enjoy the old paths and find rest for our souls.</p>"
Heroes Of The City Of Man: A Christian Guide To Select Ancient Literature,Peter J. Leithart,"""What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?"" For roughly two thousand years, Christians have greatly differed in their answers to Tertullian's pivotal question. Some would have us believe that the ancient Greeks and Romans are responsible for the entire shape and substance of Western culture. Others would prefer to jettison them altogether. Here, Peter Leithart suggests a careful and balanced approach as he analyzes some of the grand classics of ancient literature, including the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Odyssey</i>, the <i>Aeneid</i>, and four prominent Greek dramas. Demonstrating what it means to ""plunder the Egyptians,"" <i>Heroes of the City of Man</i> instructs the reader how we can use the advances of the City of Man to build the City of God."
Royko: A Life In Print,"Ciccone, F. Richard.","""When Royko began his career in journalism in the 1950s, newspapers were the sole providers of information, uniquely individual, thriving or failing on their abilities to report faster, write better, and laugh louder than their competitors. Journalism was a tough profession. Police reporters were on the take from mobsters and editors paid more attention to advertisers than to readers. Reporters carried phony police badges and hid pints of bad whiskey in their bottom drawers. They smoked. They drank. And Royko out-wrote the best of them. He insulted and taunted the most vicious killers in Chicago and the most powerful big city boss of the century. He exposed graft and greed. He damned hypocrisy and he defended the little man."" ""Mike Royko was also haunted by conflict. A difficult man, he would intimidate his assistants every morning and retire to the Billy Goat Tavern every night. He was arrogant and kind. He was incomparably witty and suddenly morose. He was vain and insecure. He played hard and he wrote harder and longer than any other newspaperman."" ""Royko: A Life in Print not only tells the story of one of America's greatest newspapermen, but also explores the dramatic developments in journalism and in American society over the course of the twentieth century.""--BOOK JACKET."
Frank Lloyd Wright In Arizona,Lawrence W. Cheek,"""Wright fell in love with the desert quickly and profoundly,"" writes Lawrence W. Cheek. ""It was a vast, blank canvas ... it was an open-air warehouse of natural forms, colors, and textures that both delighted and inspired him.""<br>
<br>
Frank Lloyd Wright first came to Arizona in 1928. In this spectacular desert landscape he built his winter headquarters, Taliesin West, and found a passion that drove him for the next 31 years of his life. In the first book to focus solely on Wright's work in Arizona, Lawrence W. Cheek explores the twelve breathtaking buildings that Wright contributed to the state. Cheek also delves into the audacious, mischievous, egocentric, and often outrageous life of Frank Lloyd Wright and examines today's Taliesin West, still a center of vigilant devotion to the man often called the greatest architect of the twentieth century."
"Small, Misty Mountain: The Awanadjo Almanack",Rob Mccall,"<b>A collection of natural and unnatural events devoted to breaking down the wall of hostility between us and Creation.</b><br>
<br>
Certain places make us more vulnerable to the Holy. This is a real phenomenon, not some romantic notion—a spiritual resource as full and as valuable as any other ""natural resource."" Approached with devotion, these places have the power to heal and to reveal.<br>
<br>
""Awanadjo"" is Algonkian for ""small, misty mountain,"" referring to Blue Hill Mountain in Blue Hill, Maine; but it can just as well describe your mountain or any sacred place that has the power to transform and impart the sense of being at home in Nature.<br>
<br>
Following in the long tradition of natural theology from Lao-tse to St. Francis, John Scotus Erigena, Newton, Darwin, Thoreau, Rachel Carson, Wendell Berry, and Annie Dillard, this volume gathers decades of Rob McCall's meticulous observation and buoyant commentary about a mountain and its surroundings.

Hiding Edith (holocaust Remembrance Series),Kathy Kacer,"<em>Hiding Edith</em> tells the true story of Edith Schwalb, a young Jewish Girl sent to live in a safe house after the Nazi invasion of France. Edith's story is remarkable not only for her own bravery, but for the bravery of those that helped her: an entire village, including its mayor and citizenry, heroically conspired to conceal the presence of hundreds of Jewish children who lived in the safe house. The children went to the local school, roamed the streets and ate good food, all withot having to worry about concealing their Jewish identity. And during Nazi raids, the children camped out until the coast was clear.
<p>Intensively researched and sensitively written, this book, illustrated with photographs and maps, both comforts and challenges a young reader's spirit, skillfully addressing both the horrors and hope that children experienced during the Holocaust.</p>"

A course in Miracles : Combined Volume,Foundation for Inner Peace,"<i>A Course in Miracles</i> is a complete self-study spiritual thought system. As a three-volume curriculum consisting of a <i>Text</i>, <i>Workbook for Students</i>, and <i>Manual for Teachers</i>, it teaches that the way to universal love and peace-or remembering God-is by undoing guilt through forgiving others. The Course thus focuses on the healing of relationships and making them holy. <i>A Course in Miracles</i> also emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum, of which there are many thousands. Consequently, even though the language of the Course is that of traditional Christianity, it expresses a non-sectarian, non-denominational spirituality. <i>A Course in Miracles</i> therefore is a universal spiritual teaching, not a religion.<br><br> The Text presents the theory of the Course and has built into its study the development of the <i>experience</i> of forgiveness that is the Course's goal for the student. In this regard, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> states that its goal for you is happiness and peace. (Text, p. 241) (T-13.II.7:1) The Text also explains the basis for fear and guilt, and how they can be overcome through miracles, which are defined as maximal expressions of love. Miracles are also defined as the shift in perception from fear to love. <p>The Workbook for Students consists of 365 lessons, an exercise for each day of the year. This one-year training program <i>begins</i> the process of changing the student's mind and perception, though it is not intended to bring one's learning to completion. As stated in the Preface to the Course, At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. (Preface: ix)</p><p>The Manual for Teachers is written in question-and-answer form and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes clarification of a number of terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the Text and for their practical application through the Workbook.</p><p><i>A Course in Miracles</i> was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman through a process of inner dictation she identified as coming from Jesus. A clinical and research psychologist and tenured Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, she was assisted by Dr. William Thetford, her department head, who was also a tenured Professor of Medical Psychology at the Medical Center where they both worked.</p><p><i>A Course in Miracles</i> was first published in 1975, the year Dr. Schucman assigned copyright of the Course to the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). Since the beginning and as designated, this Foundation has been its publisher, disseminator, and copyright/trademark holder, although in 1999 it assigned the copyright and trademark to the Foundation for <i>A Course in Miracles</i> (FACIM). There are currently about one and a half million copies of the Course in circulation worldwide. Translations in Chinese, Dutch, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish are also available, with twelve other translations now in progress.</p><p>What exactly, then, is <i>A Course in Miracles</i>? The summary introduction, which appears in its Text, is quite succinct and brief. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.</p><p>This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:</p><p class=null1>Nothing real can be threatened.<br> Nothing unreal exists.</p><p>Herein lies the peace of God.</p></blockquote>"
Everybody's Autobiography,Gertrude Stein,"<i>Everybody's Autobiography is among the very best of Gertrude's writing—it] speaks with the true and original voice of Gertrude Stein, without apparent art or bravado. —Janet Hobhouse</i>~In 1937, Gertrude Stein wrote a sequel to <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, but this darker and more complex work was long misunderstood and neglected. An account of her experiences as a result of writing a bestseller, <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> is as funny and engaging as <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, but it is also a searing meditation on the meaning of success and identity in America. Posing as the representative American, Stein transforms her story into history—responding to the tradition of Thoreau and Henry Adams, she writes: ""I used to be fond of saying that America, which was supposed to be a land of success, was a land of failure. Most of the great men in America had a long life of early failure and a long life of later failure."" <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i> is Stein at her most accessible and her most serious, and may yet prove to be among her most popular books."
Impressionists By The Sea,"John House', 'David Hopkins","<i>Impressionists by the Sea</i> accompanies a joyous summer exhibition of the same name at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. Through some sixty popular Impressionist works, coauthor John House considers the pictorial representation of the seaside during the 19th century, when the coastline of northern France was transformed from a fishing center into a popular vacation spot. <br>
<br>
This handsomely produced book reveals how painting developed in tandem with social and economic changes. House shows how painters initially cast the coastline in a romantic role, focusing on the evocation of the sublime force of nature and the picturesque display of local fishermen, but by the early 1860s&amp;#151at the moment the resorts of Deauville and Trouville were coming into vogue&amp;#151painters such as Boudin, Manet, and Monet were capturing vacationers in all their relaxed glory. <br>

"Lost History: Contras, Cocaine, The Press & 'project Truth'",Robert Parry,"<i>Lost History</i> is a kind of All the President's Men, in reverse. It tells the inside story of how reporters uncovered the Iran-contra scandal and paid dearly with their careers. More broadly, the book explains how the vaunted Watergate press corps of the 1970s changed into the tabloidish Monica Lewinsky press corps of the 1990s -- and how much of this era's most important history has been ""lost.""

Red Snow,Susumu Katsumata,"<p class=""null1"">AN AWARD-WINNING BOOK FROM A LEGENDARY MANGA-KA</p>
<p>Continuing D+Q’s groundbreaking exploration of the fascinating world of <i>Gekiga</i>, this collection of short stories is drawn with great delicacy and told with subtle nuance by the legendary Japanese artist Susumu Katsumata. The setting is the premodern Japanese countryside of the author’s youth, a slightlymagical world where ancestral traditions hold sway over a people in the full vigor of life, struggling to survive the harsh seasons and the difficult life of manual laborers and farmers. While the world they inhabit has faded into memory and myth, the universal fundamental emotions of the human heart prevail at the center of these tender stories.</p>
<p>Katsumata began publishing comic strips in the legendary avantgarde magazine <i>Garo</i> (which also published his contemporaries Yoshihiro Tatsumi and Yoshiharu Tsuge) in 1965 while enrolled in the Faculty of Science in Tokyo. He abandoned his studies in 1971 to become a professional comics artist, alternating the short humorous strips upon which he built his reputation with stories of a more personal nature in which he tenderly depicted the lives of peasants and farmers from his native region. In 2006, Katsumata won the 35th Japanese Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize for <i>Red Snow</i>.</p>"

A Drifting Life,Yoshihiro Tatsumi,"<p class=""null1"">The epic autobiography of a manga master</p>
<p>Acclaimed for his visionary short-story collections <i>The Push Man and Other Stories</i>, <i>Abandon the Old in Tokyo</i>, and <i>Good-Bye</i>—originally created nearly forty years ago, but just as resonant now as ever—the legendary Japanese cartoonist Yoshihiro Tatsumi has come to be recognized in North America as a precursor of today’s graphic novel movement. <i>A Drifting Life</i> is his monumental memoir eleven years in the making, beginning with his experiences as a child in Osaka, growing up as part of a country burdened by the shadows of World War II.</p>
<p>Spanning fifteen years from August 1945 to June 1960, Tatsumi’s stand-in protagonist, Hiroshi, faces his father’s financial burdens and his parents’ failing marriage, his jealous brother’s deteriorating health, and the innumerable pitfalls that await him in the competitive manga market of mid-twentieth-century Japan. He dreams of following in the considerable footsteps of his idol, the manga artist Osamu Tezuka (<i>Astro Boy</i>, <i>Apollo’s Song</i>, <i>Ode to Kirihito</i>, <i>Buddha</i>)—with whom Tatsumi eventually became a peer and, at times, a stylistic rival. As with his short-story collection, <i>A Drifting Life</i> is designed by Adrian Tomine.</p>

"Hagar before the occupation, Hagar after the occupation: poems","Jubūrī, Amal.","<p>""Through these poems, Amal al-Jubouri connects us to the earliest known poems, and yet the dialectic tension between them is utterly contemporary. Al-Jubouri writes 'This is my protest, this is my folly,' yet these poems are neither simple protest nor in any sense folly. These poems are both essential and eternal.""—Nick Flynn</p>
<p>This translation of Iraqi author Amal al-Jubouri contextualizes America's occupation of Iraq through the Qur'an's story of Hagar. Complementary pairs of poems portray life before and after the war. This work simultaneously mirrors Hagar's desperate running between Safa and Marwah, as we pace frantically between pre- and post-occupation Iraq—the poet begging in vain for poetry not to abandon her people.</p>

<p>""A wonderful novel about Istanbul. The Turkish way of life, prejudices, men, politics, corruption—Esmahan Aykol writes about all these with a light and humorous touch.""—Petros Markaris, author of <i>Che Committed Suicide</i> and <i>Zone Defence</i></p>
<p>""Bubbling with hedonism, enthusiasm, love of life and books, this should be mandatory reading for those holidaying in Turkey, visitors to Istanbul, and lovers of crime novels.""—<i>Hamburger Abendblatt</i></p>
<p>This debut by a young Turkish woman novelist is set in her beloved Istanbul. The heroine, Kati Hirschel, is a foreigner and proud owner of the only mystery bookshop in town. When the director of a film starring an old school friend is found murdered in his hotel room, Kati cannot resist the temptation to start her own maverick investigation. After all, her friend Petra is the police's principal suspect, and reading all those detective novels must have taught Kati something.</p>
<p>This suspenseful tale of murder features a heroine who is funny, feisty and undresses men in her mind more often than she would like. It uses humor, social commentary, and even erotic fantasy to expose Western prejudices about Turkey, as well as Turkish stereotyping of other Europeans.</p>

Chicago Noir,"Pollack', 'Neal","<p>“<i>Chicago Noir</i> is a legitimate heir to the noble literary tradition of the greatest city in America. Nelson Algren and James Farrell would be proud.” —Stephen Elliott, author of <i>Happy Baby</i></p>
<p>“If ever a city was made to be the home of noir, it’s Chicago. These writers go straight to Chicago’s noir heart.” —Aleksandar Hemon, author of <i>Nowhere Man</i></p>
<p>Brand new stories by: Neal Pollack, Achy Obejas, Alexai Galaviz-Budziszewski, Adam Langer, Joe Meno, Peter Orner, Kevin Guilfoile, Bayo Ojikutu, Jeff Allen, Luciano Guerriero, Claire Zulkey, Andrew Ervin, M.K. Meyers, Todd Dills, C.J. Sullivan, Daniel Buckman, Amy Sayre-Roberts, and Jim Arndorfer.</p>
<p>The city of Chicago has spent much time and money over the last decade marketing itself as a tourist-friendly place for the whole family. It's got a shiny new Millennium Park, a spaceship in the middle of Soldier Field, and thousands of identical faux-brick condo buildings that seem to spring from the ground overnight. Chicago's rough-and-tumble tough-guy reputation has been replaced by a postcard with a lake view.</p>
<p>But that city's not gone. The hard-bitten streets once represented by James Farrell and Nelson Algren may have shifted locales, and they may be populated by different ethnicities, but Chicago is still a place where people struggle to survive and where, for many, crime is the only means for their survival. The stories in <i>Chicago Noir</i> reclaim that territory.</p>
<p><b><i>Chicago Noir</i> is populated</b> by hired killers and jazzmen, drunks and dreamers, corrupt cops and ticket scalpers and junkies. It's the Chicago that the Department of Tourism doesn't want you to see, a place where hard cases face their sad fates, and pay for their sins in blood. These are stories about blocks that visitors are afraid to walk. They tell of a Chicago beyond Oprah, Michael Jordan, and deep-dish pizza. This isn't someone's dream of Chicago. It's not even a nightmare. It's just the real city, unfiltered. <i>Chicago Noir</i>.</p>"

Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens (series On Ohio History And Culture),Steve Love,"<p>As a boy who grew up in Akron, F. A. Seiberling tramped the fields and woods outside of the city, hunting the area where stone had once been quarried. Even then, the dramatic views of the Cuyahoga Valley, natural vistas that spread before him like paintings, would stop young Frank in his tracks. He never forgot them. Years later, the founder of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company would build Stan Hywet-the Old English term for stone quarry-a sixty-five-room Tudor Revival mansion on seventy acres of meticulously landscaped gardens, orchards, and vistas. The skill and artistry of photographers Ian Adams and Barney Taxel portray the splendor of all four seasons at Stan Hywet, now maintained through the Stan Hywet Hall Foundation. These vivid images depict the restored mansion in its magnificent setting, capturing the springtime charm of mayapples and periwinkle in the Dell, the classic elegance of Gertrude Seiberling's Music Room, and the stark grandeur of snow-covered oaks mirrored in a reflection pool. From spring mornings to Christmas celebrations, Steve Love narrates as the reader strolls through the rooms and halls of the mansion and rambles down the lanes through its magnificent gardens and into the lives of the Seiberlings. With a foreword by F. A.'s grandson, former congressman John F. Seiberling, Stan Hywet Hall &amp; Gardens captures the Seiberling family motto, Non Nobis Solum, or, ""Not for Us Alone""-a motto which remains engraved, to this day, above the entrance to the Manor House.</p>"

Solitary Sex: A Cultural History Of Masturbation,"Laqueur, Thomas Walter.","<p>At a time when almost any victimless sexual practice has its public advocates and almost every sexual act is fit for the front page, the easiest, least harmful, and most universal one is embarrassing, discomforting, and genuinely radical when openly acknowledged. Masturbation may be the last taboo. But this is not a holdover from a more benighted age. The ancient world cared little about the subject; it was a backwater of Jewish and Christian teaching about sexuality. In fact, solitary sex as a serious moral issue can be dated with a precision rare in cultural history; Laqueur identifies it with the publication of the anonymous tract Onania in about 1722. Masturbation is a creation of the Enlightenment, of some of its most important figures, and of the most profound changes it unleashed. It is modern. It worried at first not conservatives, but progressives. It was the first truly democratic sexuality that could be of ethical interest for women as much as for men, for boys and girls as much as for their elders.The book's range is vast. It begins with the prehistory of solitary sex in the Bible and ends with third-wave feminism, conceptual artists, and the Web. It explains how and why this humble and once obscure means of sexual gratification became the evil twin — or the perfect instance — of the great virtues of modern humanity and commercial society: individual moral autonomy and privacy, creativity and the imagination, abundance and desire.</p>"

"Dark Alliance: The Cia, The Contras, And The Crack Cocaine Explosion",Gary Webb,"<p>Dark Alliance is a book that should be fiction, whose characters seem to come straight out of central casting: the international drug lord, Norwin Meneses; the Contra cocaine broker with an MBA in marketing, Danilo Blandon; and the illiterate teenager from the inner city who rises to become the king of crack, ""Freeway"" Ricky Ross. But unfortunately, these characters are real and their stories are true.<br>
In August 1996, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb stunned the world with a series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News reporting the results of his year-long investigation into the roots of the crack cocaine epidemic in America, specifically in Los Angeles. The series, titled ""Dark Alliance,"" revealed that for the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to Los Angeles street gangs and funneled millions in drug profits to the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras.<br>
Now Gary Webb has pushed his investigation even further in his book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. Drawing from recently declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that have never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities.</p>"

Icon: A Retrospective By The Grand Master Of Fantastic Art,Frank Frazetta,"<p>Frank Franzetta's paintings and illustrations have set the standard for fantasy artists for the past 50 years. His art continues to exert a tremendous influence over collectors of classic comic and sci-fi art, who pay record-setting auction prices for his original works. This lushly produced, large-format retrospective follows Frazetta's career from his apprenticeships at various publishers in the 1940s, to his 1950s breakthrough with the <i>Buck Rogers</i> and <i>Lil' Abner</i> series, to his powerfully erotic compositions for the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs and the famous <i>Conan</i> illustrations for Robert E. Howard.</p>
<p>Equally adept with pen and ink, watercolor, pencil, and sculpture, Frazetta has inspired a generation of illustrators, all striving to match the visual vigor of his subjects. <i>Icon</i> follows the creation of dozens of the master's images by reproducing preliminary line drawings and color studies integral to the development of the paintings. Seventy-five finished oil portraits are featured here, along with 34 smaller pieces, all in full color. Beautifully printed on heavy-weight high-gloss paper, this collection allows readers to fully appreciate the rich detail, composition, and brushwork in each work.</p>
<p>Accompanying the illustrations is thorough background text by Hugo Award-winning editor Arnie Fenner, which gives a historical perspective to Frazetta's art, as well as commentary by Frazetta himself on the artistic significance of each of his major paintings. William Stout contributes an insightful article about Frazetta's film work, and artists James Bama and Rick Berry share their appreciation for Frazetta.</p>


                        <p>This is the largest collection of Frank Frazetta's art ever published. Featuring work from five decades, the more than 130 museum-quality reprints includes his best-known paintings in addition to several previously unpublished works.

For a horrible moment, we thought he was dead, but he came round slowly. We suggested bivouacking until he recovered but Bill, who always thrived in adversity, was having none of it. Having bandaged his head and reversed his helmet so that the hole in it wasn’t over the hole in his head, and at his insistence bunged a fag in his mouth to keep him happy, we continued into the storm up the last 300 metres of the snow covered cliff. We emerged triumphantly over the cornice into the blizzard and whiteout, another first ascent in the bag.'</p>

My Home Is Far Away,"Powell, Dawn.","<p>My Home is Far Away is the most precisely autobiographical of Powell’s fifteen novels. In this family chronicle set in early twentieth century Ohio, young Marcia Willard’ s family struggles to keep up with the rapidly changing times, and Marcia endures disillusionment, cruelty, and betrayal to forge a survivor’s sense of independence. John Updike has compared Powell with Theodore Dreiser, Willa Cather, Sherwood Anderson, “and those other Midwestern writers who felt something epic in the national shift from rural to urban, from provincial sequestration to metropolitan liberation.” By 1941, when Powell set to work on My Home Is Far Away, she was better known for the smart, boozy, bawdy, hilarious send-ups of Manhattan high and low life. She had begun to attain a reputation for high sophistication and nothing could be less “sophisticated” – in the glittering, all-knowing, furiously present-tense, big-city manner Powell had perfected – than My Home Is Far Away.<br>
 This was the month of cherries and peaches, of green apples beyond the grape arbor, of little dandelion ghosts in the grass, of sour grass and four-leaf clovers, of still dry heat holding the smell of nasturtiums and dying lilacs. This was the best month of all and the best day. It was not birthday, Easter, Christmas, or picnic, but all these things and something else, something wonderful, something utterly unknown. The two little girls in embroidered white Sunday dresses knew no way to express their secret joy but by whirling each other dizzily over the lawn crying, “We’re moving, we’re moving! We’re moving to London Junction!”<br>
 My Home Is Far Away is one of the very few examples of a book written for adults, with an adult command of the language, that maintains the vantage point of a hungry, serious child throughout. It might be likened to a memoir that has been penned not with the usual tranquility of distance but rather with the sense that everything happening to the characters is happening right now, without any promise of eventual escape, without any assurance that childhood, too, shall pass away.<br>

Entanglement (polish State Prosecutor Szacki Investigates),Zygmunt Miloszewski,"<p>Praise for <i>Entanglement</i>:</p>
<p>“An exquisite contemporary crime story. Polish literature boasts a real master.”—Jerzy Pilch, author of <i>The Mighty Angel</i></p>
<p>“A tightly plotted mystery novel, dark humor and contemporary Warsaw perfectly rendered.”—<i>Przekrój Magazine</i></p>
<p>The morning after a group psychotherapy session in a Warsaw monastery, Henry Talek is found dead, a roasting spit stuck in one eye.</p>
<p>Public prosecutor Teodor Szacki, world-weary, suffering from bureaucratic exhaustion and marital ennui, feels that life has passed him by. But this case changes everything. Because of it he meets Monika Grzelka, a young journalist whose charms prove difficult to resist, and he discovers the frightening power of certain esoteric therapeutic methods. The shocking videos of the sessions lead him to an array of possible scenarios. Could one of the patients have become so absorbed by his therapy role-playing that he murdered Telak? Szacki’s investigation leads him to an earlier murder, before the fall of Communism.</p>
<p>And why is the Secret Police suddenly taking an interest in all this? As Szacki uncovers each piece of the puzzle, facts emerge that he’d be better off not knowing, for his own safety.</p>

Occupy (occupied Media Pamphlet Series),Noam Chomsky,"<p>PRAISE FOR NOAM CHOMSKY'S <i>OCCUPY</i> AND ZUCCOTTI PARK PRESS:</p>
<p>“Having spent so much time thinking about and engaging with social movements, Chomsky is both optimistic about the energy of Occupy and realistic about the challenges it faces. He appreciates the “just do it” ethos and embraces its radical approach to participatory democracyWhat makes Chomsky’s perspective so interesting, aside from the wealth of his political experience, is the range of his interests. He draws from examples around the world to demonstrate his points. ...It’s a big agenda that Occupy has identified, nothing less than a complete renewal of U.S. society and the U.S. role in the world. Chomsky sees not only the radical agenda but also the radical practice of the Occupiers. “Part of what functioning, free communities like the Occupy communities can be working for and spreading to others is just a different way of living, which is not based on maximizing consumer goods, but on maximizing values that are important for life,” he concludes in this valuable set of remarks and interviews.”<br>
<b>—John Feffer, Foreign Policy in Focus, Pick Review</b></p>
<p>“For decades, Chomsky has been marginalized for his insightful, levelheaded, and accurate observations about how our society functions. In <i>Occupy</i>, Chomsky... sets the record straight. And he’s got an answer for everything. “It’s necessary,” Chomsky warns, “to get out into the country and get people to understand what this is about, and what they can do about it, and what the consequences are of not doing anything about it.” <i>Occupy</i> begins with a powerful editor’s note from Greg Ruggiero, who comments on ‘the heartlessness and inhumanity of the system,’ where ‘people’s stolen homes are sold off to the highest bidder.’ And if it isn’t obvious to those who are still asking what the demands of Occupy Wall Street are, Ruggiero puts it plainly: ‘Occupy embodies a vision of democracy that is fundamentally antagonistic to the management of society as a corporate-controlled space that funds a political system to serve the wealthy, ignore the poor.’ One can only cringe at the thought of what will happen if we continue to ignore the wisdom of Noam Chomsky. He gives a clue in <i>Occupy</i>.”<br>
<b>—The Coffin Factory, The Magazine for People who Love Books</b></p>
<p><i>Occupy</i> is another vital contribution from Chomsky to the literature of defiance and protest, and a red-hot rallying call to forge a better, more egalitarian future.""<br>
<b>—Alternet</b></p>
<p>Chomsky advocates intelligent activism by those who see the divorce between public policy and public opinion. He is both optimistic and realistic towards this “first major public response to 30 years of class war.”<br>
<b>—IRISH TIMES, PICK REVIEW</b></p>
<p>“<i>Occupy</i>, is at once a vivid portrait of the now-global movement and a practical guide to intelligent activism, infused with Chomsky’s signature meditations on everything from how the wealthiest 1% came to steer society to what a healthy democracy would look like to how we can separate money from politics. Alongside Chomsky’s words are some of the most moving and provocative photographs from the Occupy movement. ... One of] 10 essential books on protest.”<br>
<b>—Maria Popova, Brain Pickings</b></p>
<p>In <i>Occupy</i>, Chomsky discusses the cornerstone issues, questions and demands that have been driving ordinary Americans to critique the influence of the ""1%."" The book begins and ends with Chomsky celebrating the life and work of his longtime friend and colleague, Howard Zinn, author of <i>A People’s History of the United States.</i> As a call to action, Chomsky encourages people to continue organizing, to continue struggling, and to continue defending citizenship and community-driven democracy from predation from the relentless encroachments of wealth and corporate power.</p>"
"Kitāb al-Tanwīr fī isqāṭ al-tadbīr, The Book of illumination ; along with `Unwān al-tawfīq fī ādāb al-ṭarīq, Sign of success on the spiritual path","Ibn ʻaṭāʼ Allāh, Aḥmad Ibn Muḥammad , -1309","<p>Presenting a mystical and theological analysis of our human urge to create idols for ourselves and out of ourselves, this medieval author carefully recounts the enlightening counsels of his own masters. He is most attentive to the subtle psychological working of our human ego, marshaling resources for his Islamic tradition that can confront and overcome it. The result of desisting from claiming as our right and ability what is clearly beyond our control is illumination of the heart, clarity of the mind, and tranquility of the soul. This new translation masterfully illustrates the goal of Ibn Ata' Allah's discussion of achieving inner illumination of the heart, which is close to the sense of ""enlightenment"" that has become common in English language discussions of spirituality and gnosis.</p>"

Navajo Rug Designs (look West Series),Susan Lowell,"<p>Speaking the language of color, pattern, and texture, these rug designs document the interesting period, about a century ago, when Juan Lorenzo Hubbell's Ganado trading post was a center of Southwestern culture as well as commerce. Hubbell's many visitors included several artists who obliged their host by painting ""portraits"" of the Navajo weavings that Hubbell bought, sold, and often influenced. By showing them to weavers, Hubbell used these painting to inspire a remarkable artistic collaboration that crossed cultures and genres and probably still affects Navajo weavings and American art today.</p>

"Sonny Liston: His Life, Strife And The Phantom Punch",Rob Steen,"<p>The career of Charles ""Sonny"" Liston has attracted more debate and hostility than that of any other master of the squared circle.

Theme Park (objekt),Scott A. Lukas,"<p>Theme parks are a uniquely interactive and enduring form of entertainment that have influenced architecture, technology, and culture in surprising ways for more than a century, as Scott Lukas now reveals in his compelling historical chronicle.</p>
<p><i>Theme Park</i> takes the primitive amusements of pleasure gardens as its starting point and launches from there into a rich, in-depth investigation of the evolution of the theme park over the twentieth century. Lukas examines theme parks in countries around the world—including in the United States, Mexico, Europe, Japan, China, South Africa, and Australia—and how themed fairs and parks developed through diverse means and in a variety of settings. The book examines world-famous and lesser-known parks, including the early parks of Coney Island; Madrid’s Movieworld; a series of World Fairs and their luxurious exhibition halls; Six Flags parks and virtual theme parks today; and, of course, the unparalleled achievements of Disneyland and Disney World.</p>
<p>Lukas analyzes the theme park as a living entity that unexpectedly shapes people, their relationships, and the world around them. Theme parks have now become complex representations of the human mind itself, he contends, through its interpretations of books, feature films, video games, and Web sites. Ultimately, <i>Theme Park</i> reveals, the wider influence of theme parks can be found in the shopping malls, branded stores, and casinos that employ the tricks and techniques of amusement parks to dominate our entertainment world today.<br>
Packed with captivating illustrations, <i>Theme Park</i> takes us on historical roller coaster ride that both reanimates the places that shaped our childhoods and anticipates the future of escapism and fantasy fun.</p>

Icons Of The Highway: A Celebration Of Small-town America,"Tony Worobiec', 'Eva Worobiec","<p>Tony and Eva Worobiec once again take to the road to create a beautiful photographic essay about an America that’s fast fading away.<br>

Who Killed Homer: The Demise Of Classical Education And The Recovery Of Greek Wisdom,"Victor Davis Hanson', 'John Heath","An in-depth study of why the Greek point of view is crucial to a well-rounded education, Who Killed Homer? analyzes how and why it is vanishing from our present-day educational system. This impassioned call to arms argues that if we lose our knowledge of the Greeks, we lose our understanding of who we are. <br>
 
<p>The literature, art, philosophy, and values of the Classical World have been synonymous with Western education itself. The traditions of the Greeks explain why Western culture is so uniquely dynamic and why its tenets of democracy, capitalism, materialism, personal freedom, civil liberty, and constitutional government are now sweeping the globe. Yet, the general public in America knows less about its cultural origins than ever, as Classical education rapidly slips away from the curricula of our high schools, universities, even our elementary schools.<br>
</p>
<p>The authors examine how this has come about through time and how modernism alone is not the culprit. The ""keepers"" of Classicism who have failed to keep the spirit of Greek thinking alive has resulted in its demise, precisely at a time when it is most needed to explain, guide, and warn the public about both the wonders and dangers of their own culture. Can the Classics and the Greeks be saved for another generation?</p>"

Literary Paris: A Guide,Jessica Powell,"For centuries Paris was the destination of writers from the provinces and from across the ocean, and the city swiftly became an integral part of the lives and work of those who went there. <i>Literary Paris</i> profiles thirty writers and the apartments, cafes, bistros, theaters, museums, and other places central to their daily lives and featured in their work.
<p><i>Literary Paris</i> opens with Moliere, whose farces lampooning man’s vanity and hypocrisy delighted the royal courts. In the next century, we glimpse the destitute Zola, so hungry that he ate sparrows caught on his windowsill, and the perpetually bankrupt Balzac who, hoping to evade creditors, required friends to give a secret phrase–“Apple season has arrived” or “I come with lace from Belgium”–to gain admittance into his quarters.</p>
<p>Among the twentieth-century writers profiled are Georges Simenon, creator of wildly popular detective novels, who in Paris began an affair with the sensational Josephine Baker; F. Scott Fitzgerald, who, instead of finding the “new rhythm” he sought, burned through his money and talent in the City of Light; as well as Henry Miller, George Orwell, James Baldwin.</p>
<p>Women writers include the scandalous Colette; George Sand, friend of Lizst and lover of Chopin; and the sophisticated <i>New Yorker</i> correspondent Janet Flanner.</p>
<p>Great city landmarks are here, including Notre Dame Cathedral, where Quasimodo imprisoned Esmerelda in Victor Hugo’s masterpiece, and the Louvre, where in 1911 the <i>Mona Lisa</i> vanished in a scandal that ruined the poet Guillame Apollinaire. Also featured are the beloved cafes integral to the city’s culture, such as Café Flore, where Simone de Beauvoir claimed a spot by the stove each morning to write while her lover, Jean-Paul Sartre, was off at war.</p>"
Eating Gluten-free With Emily,"Kruszka, Bonnie J.', 'Cihlar, Richard S.","For children, a diagnosis of celiac disease and an abrupt change to a gluten-free diet can bring about an overwhelming number of questions and concerns. What is gluten? Why can't I eat cake, cookies, and chicken nuggets like everyone else? What do I tell my friends? Answers to these and many other questions are provided in <i>EATING GLUTEN-FREE WITH EMILY</i>. Written by the mother of a child with celiac disease, who also has the disease herself, this book offers a reassuring look at celiac disease in language that a child can easily understand.<br>
 <br>
This fictional story is based on the real-life experiences many newly diagnosed children face. Five-year-old Emily and her parents wonder why she's not feeling well. Her belly is swollen, and she feels moody and sick. A trip to the doctor raises some concerns and further tests show that Emily has celiac disease. Emily talks about what food she can and cannot eat, how her Mom buys special gluten-free food, and the need to stay on a gluten-free diet at restaurants, birthday parties, friends' houses, school, and camp. <br>
<br>
With its lighthearted, colorful illustrations, <i>EATING GLUTEN-FREE WITH EMILY</i> helps children see that having celiac disease is not so scary after all. Emily acknowledges that having celiac disease is sometimes tough, but talking about her feelings with her mom always makes her feel better. She knows that celiac disease is only part of who she is--she also likes to jump rope, paint, tell jokes, and pick flowers! This book's positive message will be a huge boost to children with celiac disease, especially those who have been recently diagnosed."

Ibsen,"Ibsen, Henrik', 'Davis, Rick.', 'Johnston, Brian","Four of Ibsen's greatest and most popular plays come alive in these theatrically-inspired and production-tested translations. Davis and Johnston bring to Ibsen a fresh combination of scholarly insight and a sense of what communicates in the theater. Too often Ibsen in English ends up sounding like a quaint Victorian parlor dramatist. These texts capture some things that are often missed - the wit and humor, the purposeful use of certain repeated images, and the sense of daring that helped make Ibsen a revolutionary figure not just for the 19th Century, but for all time to come."

The maps are divided into four groups, each of which constitutes a chapter in the history of the war. In The Amateur Armies, Symonds describes the civilian volunteer armies that slugged it out at Bull Run and Shiloh. The Second Section, The Organized War, details the emergence of great war figures like George B. McClellan and Robert E. Lee. Confederate High Tide marks the peak of Southern hopes which collapsed in 1863 with the twin defeats at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Finally, The Total War tells about the last years of the Civil War, including Early's Raid, the Atlanta Campaign and the road to Appomattox. A short introductory essay precedes each section, accompanied by contemporary photographs and drawings that portray America's greatest military conflict.

Gerhard Richter: Forty Years of Painting,"Robert Storr', 'Gerhard Richter","Gerhard Richter is one of the most influential painters working today. Since the early 1960s, his work has received much attention and many international accolades. Richter's diverse body of work calls into question such widely held assumptions as the importance of stylistic consistency, individual artistic sensibility, spontaneous creativity, and the impact of technology and media imagery to traditional studio methods and formats. Unlike many artists today, he has explored these issues mainly through the medium of painting, challenging it to meet the demands posed by new forms of conceptual art. His varied output ranges from austere photo-based figurative realism of the early 1960s to brightly colored gestural abstractions of the early 1980s and encompasses such startling works as his brilliant cycle of black-and-white paintings of the Baader-Meinhof group, thought-provoking monochrome abstractions and banal Pop images, delicate landscapes and intimate portraits. As an artist, Richter has assumed a critical distance from vanguardists and conservatives alike regarding what painting should be; and the result has been a vital renewal of painting itself. This book accompanies the first comprehensive exhibition of the seventy-year-old German artist's paintings ever to appear in New York and includes beautiful color plates and duotones of some two hundred canvases in a broad representation of his forty years of painting. In addition, this volume contains a substantial recent interview with Richter, a chronology, selected bibliography, and comprehensive exhibition history. The retrospective this book accompanies was organized by Robert Storr, Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. After its showing in New York, this extraordinary exhibition will be seen in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C."

The Exemplary Husband: A Biblical Perspective,Stuart Scott,"God ordained marriage between a man and a woman for companionship, procreation, and so man would have a helper suitable. However, God says much more in the Bible about husbands loving their wives than He says about wives submitting to their husbands. He created marriage to be a picture of the relationship between Christ and the Church. Christ was willing to sacrifice His life for the Church, and God expects no less from husbands today. The overall purpose of The Exemplary Husband is to assist husbands toward purposeful and lasting Christlikeness for the glory of God. It was written to be a companion book for The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace. Couples who commit to the biblical principles presented in these books will find a oneness in marriage that will give God glory and bring His blessing."

The Well-Managed Classroom: Strategies to Create a Productive and Cooperative Social Climate in Your Learning Community,"Ray Burke', 'Walter Powell', 'Michele Hensley', 'Scott Hartman', 'Susan Lamke","How can the school experience be humanized so that students feel connected, valued, and motivated to learn and achieve? How can the school environment be improved so that teachers and staff feel confident, respected and safe? The Well-Managed Classroom can show you how to overhaul or enhance the social climate and build a true community in your school.<br> The authors describe the Girls and Boys Town Education Model, a school-based intervention strategy that emphasizes behavior management practices, relationship-building techniques, and social skills instruction. It offers you the structure and strategies needed to reduce disruptive behaviors and empower students with self-management skills. The Model has been implemented in hundreds of schools and school districts nationwide. Research shows that in classrooms where the Model is implemented with high fidelity, more students comply with teacher correction and stay academically engaged while office discipline referrals and student suspension days decline.<br> The benefits of social skills instruction, coupled with proactive classroom management (having rules, procedures, and consistent consequences) cannot be underestimated. When students are motivated to learn, when they feel good about the classroom environment and the relationships they have with teachers and staff, when they can manage themselves and accept responsibility for their behavior, and when they feel empowered to improve, only then can you effectively teach and students truly learn.<br> The authors, from the National Resource and Training Center at Girls and Boys Town, have many years of experience teaching and training teachers and school administrators to successfullyimplement the Education Model."
I Have My Own Song for It: Modern Poems of Ohio,"Elton Glaser', 'William Greenway","I Have My Own Song for It: Modern Poems of Ohio gathers together 117 poems by 85 poets for a fresh perspective on the Buckeye State. Not since 1911 has there been a comprehensive collection of poems written about Ohio. And this anthology is especially relevant as Ohio celebrates its 200th year as a state. It could be called Ohio's bicentennial gift to itself. These poems, written by such celebrated Ohio natives as James Wright and Mary Oliver, and by accomplished if less well known poets like Ruth L. Schwartz and Rachel Langille, offer a virtual tour of people and places in the state, traveling around Ohio's lakes and rivers, farms and open country, small towns and large cities. In resonant language and compelling imagery, in shapely verse and lines responsive to the moment's impulse, the poems bring Ohio to its citizens and, beyond the borders of the state, to lovers of poetry everywhere. The perspective may be personal or historical, close-up or wide-ranging, celebratory or otherwise, but each poem becomes part of the state's legacy passed on to future generations, a collective record of how Ohio appears to itself and to others at the beginning of the 21st century."

Eudora Welty Vol. 2: The Robber Bridegroom; Delta Wedding; The Ponder Heart; Losing Battles; The Optimist&#39;s Daughter,"Eudora Welty', 'Richard Ford', 'Michael Kreyling","In a career spanning five decades, Eudora Welty has chronicled her own Mississippi with a depth and intensity matched only by William Faulkner. One of the most influential writers of the century, her novels and stories blend the storytelling tradition of the South with a modernist sensibility attuned to the mysteries and ambiguities of experience. Welty explores the complex abundance of southern, and particularly southern women's, lives with an artistry that Salman Rushdie has called impossible to overpraise. Complete Novels gathers all of Welty's longer fiction in one volume for the first time. In The Robber Bridegroom (1942), based on a Grimm fairy tale, legendary figures from Mississippi's past, such as the keel-boat captain Mike Fink and the savage outlaws the Harp Brothers, mingle with Welty's own imaginings in a free-ranging and boisterous fantasy set along the Natchez Trace. The richly textured Delta Wedding (1946), set against a backdrop of rural Mississippi in the 1920s, vividly portrays the intricacies of family relationships in its account of the sprawling Fairchild clan. Edna Earle Ponder's unrestrained and delightfully absurd monologue, superb in its capturing of the rhythms of country speech, shows Welty's humor at its idiomatic best in The Ponder Heart (1954), a flight of invention culminating in a murder trial that becomes an occasion for exuberant comedy. The monumental Losing Battles (1970), composed over fifteen years, brings Welty's imaginative gifts to the largest canvas of her career, rendering a Depression-era family reunion with mythic scope and ebullient comic vigor. The volume concludes with The Optimist's Daughter (1972), a taut and moving story of a woman rediscovering the world of her childhood as she comes to terms with her father's death. Often considered her masterpiece, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1972."
Conversations With Cosmo: At Home With An African Grey Parrot,Betty Jean Craige,"In Conversations with Cosmo: At Home with an African Grey Parrot, Dr. Betty Jean Craige tells the story of her parrot's education in the language and culture of her human friends.

Cosmo is funny-her first joke was ""Telephone for bird!""-and so is Craige. Craige's purpose in writing this very entertaining book is not only to report and explain her parrot's acquisition of language and cognitive abilities, but also-through Cosmo's story-to awaken readers to the mental activities of all the animals with whom we humans share space on our planet.

Bukowski: A Life,Neeli Cherkovski,"In Whitman's Wild Children, Neeli Cherkovski looks at twelve contemporary beat poets - Michael McClure, Charles Bukowski, John Wieners, James Broughton, Philip Lamantia, Bob Kaufman, Allen Ginsberg, William Everson, Gregory Corso, Harold Norse, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and Jack Micheline - chosen because each, like Whitman, took ""his own road"" and had little to do with what was thought acceptable in mainstream American culture during the 1940s and 1950s. Cherkovski draws on personal encounters to create biographical portraits that are engaging and animated. The result is an intimate critical memoir, written to reflect the spirit of Whitman's call for ""perfect personal candor,"" about twelve poets who helped define contemporary American literature."

Stasiland: True Stories From Behind The Berlin Wall,Anna Funder,"It's Berlin in the 1990s. A city split for forty years by the Wall is trying to knit itself back together -- a city where former Stasi men and their victims now pass one another in the street, and where, just under the surface, the Nazi past now lies buried. When Anna Funder hears of ordinary people who resisted the fearsome Stasi -- the Communist regime's secret police -- she sets out to investigate the extraordinary stories from the underbelly of the most perfected surveillance state of all time, the former East Germany. Funder finds Miriam Weber, imprisoned as a teenager after scaling the Berlin Wall, and Frau Paul, who never, ever wanted to be a hero. She visits the regime's cartographer, obsessed to this day with the Wall; she gets drunk with the legendary ""Mik Jegger"" of the east, rock star Klaus Renft, who was once declared by the authorities to ""no longer exist."" Then she finds former Stasi men, now coping with the end of their world -- men who spied on their families and friends, who irradiated people in order to keep track of them or stole pieces of their underwear to store in jars as ""smell samples."" A fiercely talented new writer, Funder has a novelist's eye for character and story. Stasiland is a lyrical, at times blackly funny look at courage, conscience and the extremes of what humans will do to one another."

"Sharing Nature With Children, 20th Anniversary Edition",Joseph Cornell,"Kas Joseph Cornell's classic book reached its 20th anniversary, Cornell drew upon a wealth of experience in nature education to significantly revise and expand his book. New nature games - favorites from the field - and Cornell's typically insightful commentary makes the second edition of this special classic even more valuable to nature lovers world-wide. The Sharing Nature movement that Cornell pioneered has now expanded to countries all over the globe. Recommended by Boy Scouts of America, American Camping Association, National Audubon Society and many others.
<p>Author Biography: Cornell is one of the most highly regarded nature educators in the world today. Being with him in nature is a memorable event because of his obvious joy being in nature and his love for the Earth. In the late 1970s, Cornell's book introduced ``nature games"" in which nature is the teacher games that inform, inspire, and are just plain fun. Almost two decades later, with about 500,000 copies of Sharing Nature with Children sold in 15 languages, and many thousands of his other books, ``Sharing Nature"" has become not just a book, but a worldwide approach to nature education. Cornell says, ``I wrote my first book, Sharing Nature with Children because I passionately wanted others to know about these wonderful games, and this exciting way of teaching. Since the book's publication, it's been a joy to see thousands of people embrace its activities and philosophy with enthusiasm equal to mine."" Why such universal appeal? ``I believe it's because in addition to teaching ecology creatively,"" Cornell says, ``these games help people experience a profound sense of joy, serenity, and belonging to the natural world. Nature activities help people to tune into something very deep inside themselves. The games provide a wonderful glimpse into another way of being.""</p>

Self-help Skills For People With Autism: A Systematic Teaching Approach (topics In Autism),"Stephen R. Anderson', 'Amy L. Jablonski', 'Vicki Madaus Knapp', 'Marcus L Thomeer","Learning self-help skills-eating, dressing, toileting, and personal hygiene-can be challenging for people with autism, but is essential for independence. <i>Self-Help Skills for People with Autism</i> thoroughly describes a systematic approach that parents (and educators) can use to teach basic self-care to children, ages 24 months to early teens, and even older individuals. With an encouraging tone, the authors-behavior<br>
analysts and psychologists-emphasize that it's worthwhile to devote the extra time and effort now to teach skills rather than have your child be forever dependent on others. <br>
 
<p><br>
The many case studies throughout <i>Self-Help Skills</i> depict individuals with deficits in specific self-care tasks, and demonstrate how a coordinated and systematic approach is effective in teaching more complex skills. For example, a 12-old with the self-feeding skills of a toddler, who was excluded from the school cafeteria, is taught to stay at the table to eat a full meal using utensils. The book's beginning chapters explain the teaching process in detail:</p>
<p>Specify the target skill to be taught after prioritizing the self-care tasks that are most important and will likely have the greatest success rate</p>
<p>-Use task analysis to break complex skills into a series of small steps that will later be<br>
 linked together to form the more complex skill<br>
<br>
-Apply a systematic approach to instruction that consistently employs proven methods for<br>
 teaching people with autism including verbal prompting, reinforcers/rewards, chaining,<br>
 graduated guidance, shaping, modeling, visual supports, etc.<br>
<br>
-Monitor progress by collecting and analyzing data<br>
<br>
-Modifyyour approach as needed to achieve the target goal</p>
<p>A chapter is devoted to each of the four skill areas (eating, dressing, toileting, personal hygiene) offering detailed insight and specific instruction strategies. Appendices contain forms to complete for task analyses, instructional plans, and data collection. With the information in <i>Self-Help Skills</i>, parents can immediately start teaching their child, or refer back to the book to fine-tune skills as their child develops.</p>

To Hope And Back: The Journey Of The St. Louis (holocaust Remembrance Series),Kathy Kacer,"Lisa and Sol board the luxury ship St. Louis in Hamburg, Germany, on May 13, 1939. Lisa and her family are in first class; Sol and his parents are below in tourist class. The children have mixed feelings—they're excited to be beginning this voyage to a better life and sad to be leaving their old lives behind. They are Jewish, as are almost all of the 937 passengers on board, and although war has not been officially declared in Europe, the Nazis have been persecuting Jews for years. As they set sail for Cuba, the atmosphere on the ship is optimistic, led by the German captain Gustave Shröder, who is determined to see his passengers to safety. But as they learn that Hitler's propaganda has turned the country against them, the mood changes to despair. They are turned away—first from Cuba, then the United States, and then Canada. 
<p>The story of Lisa and Sol is set against the tragic true history of the St. Louis. Denied entry from port after port, the captain was forced to return his Jewish passengers to Europe, where many died in the Holocaust. Through the eyes of Sol and Lisa, we see the injustice and heartbreak that were caused by the prejudice and hatred of so many.</p>"

Magnificent Monologues For Kids (hollywood 101),"Chambers Stevens', 'Renee Rolle-whatley', 'Steven Woolf","Magnificent Monologues for Kids provides 5-12 year-olds with original age-appropriate comedic and dramatic monologues, all 100% kid tested. Chambers Stevens, Los Angeles' premiere kids acting coach, introduces young actors to the joys and how-to's of performing monologues in preparation of auditions and classroom oral language presentations. More than 50 kid-friendly monologues are incorporated. Each monologue is named and subtitled for quick content perusal. A glossary of up-to-date industry terms, index and bibliography of magnificent performances by child actors in film are also included as a study and motivation aid. In the foreword, Steven Woolf, renowned repertory theater director, discusses the role of monologues in the development of today's actor. Monologues in the book are all original, easy to read, easy to understand, require a minimum of props and work in impromptu settings. Perfect for teachers of theater arts and language arts/speech, parents and counselors interested in increasing the self-confidence and self esteem of young people through the performance arts. Great for classroom, variety talent shows, parties, competitions, and ultimately, auditions. 
<p>There are many techniques used by parents, teachers and agents of social services to provide young people with tools they can utilize to promote self esteem and build self confidence. None are quite so affective as those which encompass the performing arts. Children are performers, almost by definition. They process their ever-changing, ever-growing world view by ""acting out"" what they see, hear, absorb. This makes the performing arts ideal for children. They become free to express attitudes, mannerisms and ways of being which they see as defining both themselves, as they are, and themselves, as they wish they could be. Our title, Magnificent Monologues for Kids, affords the curious child the opportunity for self-motivated expression. All the monologues were tested with kids; all absolutely loved performing them. Why? Chamber's unique ability to tap into the mindset of his students and express their world view, their way. These monologues, and the advice offered by Chambers, become pocketpals for avid student thespians. In the end, it's the realism kids hear expressed in his words that they clamor to act out in their own voice, in their own way. These monologues then are not only catalysts for confidence-building experiences, but also agents for building self esteem through the hands-on orientation endemic to the performing arts. As a publisher of quality material for children, we couldn't be more pleased to present this series, Hollywood 101, and its first title, Magnificent Monologues for Kids. Look for The Ultimate Commercial Book for Kids and Teens, too, and see just how much we can say in five short sentences!</p>

Eight years later, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for her discovery of Radium and Polonium.

This biography includes an essay by Sabine Seifert on the life of Marie Curie's little-recognized daughter and coworker, Irene Joliot-Curie, who was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1936."
An anthology of African art: the twentieth century,"Fall', ""N'goné And Pivin"", 'Jean Loup edited By]","M'Bokolo, Elikia
<p>The term ""Modern African Art"" is not an abuse of language. The 20th century has seen, but not properly documented, the birth, development, and maturation of contemporary art in sub-Saharan Africa, an art which was not simply imported in the 1950s but which finds its sources both in colonial realities and in local cultures and civilizations. ""Anthology of African Art: The Twentieth Century"" does not propose to document any one African art, but rather to open up this vast but underexplored field to include a diverse theoretical, historical, geographical, and critical map of this dense and ancient region. Contributions by more than 30 international authors recount the birth of art schools in the 1930s, the development of urban design and public art, and the importance of socially-concerned art during the Independence movements. From Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the Belgian Congo to Ghana, Senegal, and Angola, through the works of hundreds of artists working in every conceivable medium and context, this anthology manages the continental and unique feat of providing a thorough, expansive, diversified, and fully illustrated history of African art in the 20th century.<br>
Since 1991, Paris-based Revue Noire Editions has dedicated itself to the multidisciplinary artistic production of the African continent and the African diaspora. Publishers of the critically-acclaimed ""An Anthology of African Photography"", a comprehensive chronicle of African photography from the mid-1800s to the present, Revue Noire also produces a self-titled magazine devoted to contemporary African art and culture.

My Misspent Youth: Essays,Meghan Daum,"Meghan Daum is one of the most celebrated nonfiction writers of her generation, widely recognized for the fresh, provocative approach with which she unearths hidden fault lines in the American landscape. From her well-remembered New Yorker essays about the financial demands of big-city ambition and the ethereal, strangely old-fashioned allure of cyber relationships to her dazzlingly hilarious riff in Harper's about musical passions that give way to middle-brow paraphernalia, Daum delves into the center of things while closely examining the detritus that spills out along the way. She speaks to questions at the root of the contemporary experience, from the search for authenticity and interpersonal connection in a society defined by consumerism and media; to the disenchantment of working in a ""glamour profession""; to the catastrophic effects of living among New York City's terminal hipsters. With precision and well-balanced irony, Daum implicates herself as readily as she does the targets that fascinate and horrify her. In a review of The KGB Bar Reader, in which Daphne Merkin singled out Daum's essay about the inability to mourn a friend's death, Merkin wrote: ""It's brutally quick, the way this happens, this falling in love with a writer's style. Daum's story hooked me by the second line. Hmm, I thought, this is a writer worth suspending my routines for."""

Visual Supports For People With Autism: A Guide For Parents And Professionals (topics In Autism),"Marlene J. Cohen', 'Donna L.

Visual supports are particularly beneficial to people with autism because they help make abstract concepts concrete and capitalize on the user's inherent visual learning strengths. 
<p><i>Visual Supports for People with Autism</i> shows parents and educators how incorporating these aids while teaching can improve academic performance, behavior, interaction with others, and self-help skills. In a friendly, conversational-style, the authors, both certified behavior analysts, describe the deficits typical of autism-language, memory, temporal sequential skills, attention, motivation, and social skills-and present strategies to use visual supports to address those issues at school and home. This guide presents an abundance of examples, illustrated by dozens of black &amp; white and color photos, including:</p>

Mother Teresa,Navin Chawla,"Mother Teresa's name immediately conjures up a vision of a small, frail woman in a white sari, offering love and compassion to the poorest of the poor who live in the slums of Calcutta, in cardboard boxes in London, in the ghettos of New York, and in the shadow of the Vatican itself. In recognition of her unique work, the world has lavished on her its highest honors and awards, from the Nobel Peace Prize to the Order of Merit presented by Queen Elizabeth. These she has accepted only in the name of the poor, whom she and her Missionaries of Charity so devotedly serve - 'I am but a pencil in the hands of the Lord, it is his work', she has repeatedly said. Starting out with no resources or preconceived ideas, armed only with her faith, Mother Teresa has created an enormously successful religious order that has spread to over a hundred countries, setting up institutions for the destitute, the handicapped, orphans, the leprosy-affected and the dying. Yet her main work remains in the midst of the slums and the dirt of the streets."

"Zuppe: Soups From The Kitchen Of The American Academy In Rome, Rome Sustainable Food Project",Mona Talbott,"Much more than a collection of remarkable soups, Mona Talbott’s <i>Zuppe</i> is also a wise and gentle tutorial on the “the beauty and delicious rewards of frugality” and how the humblest foods can be the most profoundly satisfying. In addition to 50 recipes, Talbott shares approaches and techniques that can change the way a cook thinks about economy, improvisation, and using all the flavors and nutrients inherent in each ingredient.
<p>A Chez Panisse graduate, Talbott was chosen by Alice Waters to be Executive Chef of the innovative Rome Sustainable Food Project at the American Academy in Rome. There, while cooking for the Academy’s creative community of scholars, historians, artists, archaeologists, and architects, Talbott perfected a repertoire of dishes made from local, seasonal, organic ingredients. Central to the menu are soups.</p>
<p>Inspired by the traditions of cucina povera, the so-called “cuisine of the poor” that has been the source of so many brilliant Italian dishes, Talbott’s recipes waste nothing, employ the concept of arrangiarsi (“making do”), and skillfully transform leftovers. And, in another nod to the wisdom and economy of traditional kitchens, she also points out which soups can easily be made into one-dish meals with the addition of a single ingredient such as a poached egg, a piece of grilled toast, or even clams.</p>
<p>Organized seasonally, <i>Zuppe</i> also serves as a practical guide to using the bounty of farmers markets throughout the year.</p>"
Lonely Planet Signspotting: Absurd & Amusing Signs From Around The World,['Doug Lansky'],"<b>From The Publisher</b>
<p>As anyone who has spent time on the road knows, you often have to depend on signs...to navigate through a town, locate your hotel, even obey the law - a scary thought if you've ever come across any of the publicly posted absurdities that appear in this book. Signs about as easy to understand as a Swahili auctioneer (to a non-Swahili speaker) or as well-planned as the dance steps in a mosh pit with the help of signspotters around the globe, we've assembled a collection of some of the most unintentionally entertaining postings on the planet - we hope they confuse and amuse you!</p>
<p class=""null1"">From the Author</p>
<p>Signspotting is a visual tour through the 'Far Side' of travel -- a guide to the head-scratching public postings that dot the highways and byways around the world. As a longtime fan of Gary Larson's cartoons, the comical absurdity of these signs may have been what attracted me to start collecting them in the first place. The thing is, I never would have guessed that there's stuff out there stranger than what Larson dreamed up. It almost suggests that Larson didn't have such a delightfully warped mind after all -- he had just been out traveling. There's a part of you that wants to just laugh when you see these Monty Python-esque signs. And there's another more sensitive part saying, 'Wait a minute, these people are putting up signs as a favor to us. It's not their first language, they're doing their best, and we wouldn't do any better if we started putting up signs for tourists in other languages.' I figure that as long as we recognize that we would have all nationalities rolling in our streets with laugher if we attempted to be as thoughtful to them as they're trying to be to us, then there's no harm in enjoying the signs for what they are: side-splitting inadvertent comedy. Besides, some of the very best signs come from English-speaking countries where they should (in theory) know better. During the last four years, I have received well over 10,000 photos of funny signs. This book, you might say, is Signspotting's greatest hits collection. If you haven't seen these yet, you'll be amazed at what's decorating our planet.<br>

Jerusalem: chronicles from the Holy City,"['Delisle, Guy']","<p class=""null1"">""Neither Jewish nor Arab, Delisle explores Jerusalem and is able to observe this strange world with candidness and humor...But most of all, those stories convey what life in East Jerusalem is about for an expatriate.""—Haaretz</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guy Delisle expertly lays the groundwork for a cultural road map of contemporary Jerusalem, utilizing the classic stranger in a strange land point of view that made his other books, <i>Pyongyang, Shenzhen,</i> and <i>Burma Chronicles</i> required reading for understanding what daily life is like in cities few are able to travel to.&nbsp;In <i>Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City</i>, Delisle explores the complexities of a city that represents so much to so many. He eloquently examines the impact of the conflict on the lives of people on both sides of the wall while drolly recounting the quotidian: checkpoints, traffic jams, and holidays.&nbsp;When observing the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations that call Jerusalem home, Delisle’s drawn line is both sensitive and fair, assuming nothing and drawing everything. <i>Jerusalem</i> showcases once more Delisle’s mastery of the travelogue.</p>"

"Lights, Camera..travel! (lonely Planet Travel Literature)",['Don George'],"<p class=""null1"">Lights, Camera…Travel!</p>
<p>Since the Ancient Greeks, actors have been society’s storytellers. And ever since Hollywood first left the back lot, these storytellers have been traveling to far-flung corners of the world to tell those tales. We decided to ask some of the most widely traveled people in the film industry to sit down and tell us their own stories – personal, inspiring, funny, embarrassing and human experiences from their time on the road.</p>
<p>Featuring contributions by Alex Baldwin, Brooke Shields, Richard E. Grant, Neil LaBute, Bruce Beresford and Sandra Bernhard.</p>

Rookie Yearbook One,['Tavi Gevinson'],"<p class=""null1"">The first print publication edited by Tavi Gevinson, the editor in chief of <i>Rookie</i>, the website for teenage girls</p>
<p>Tavi Gevinson started her personal blog, <i>Style Rookie</i> (http://www.thestylerookie.com), in 2008, when she was eleven years old. It was a place where, from the confines of her bedroom in the suburbs, she could write about personal style and chronicle the development of her own. Within two years, the blog was averaging fifty thousand hits per day. Soon fashion designers were flying her around the world to attend and write about fashion shows, and to be a guest of honor at their parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Tavi’s interests grew beyond fashion, into culture and art and, especially, feminism. In September 2011, when she was fifteen, she launched <i>Rookie</i> (http://rookiemag.com), a website for girls like her: teenagers who are interested in fashion and beauty but also in dissecting the culture around them through a uniquely teen-girl lens. Rookie broke one million page views within its first six days. <i>Rookie Yearbook One</i> collects articles, interviews, photo editorials, and illustrations from the highly praised and hugely popular online magazine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its first year, <i>Rookie</i> has established a large inclusive international community of avid readers. In addition to its fifty-plus regular writers, photographers, and illustrators (many of whom are teenage girls themselves), <i>Rookie</i>’s contributors and interviewees have included prominent makers of popular culture such as Lena Dunham, Miranda July, Joss Whedon, Jon Hamm, Zooey Deschanel, David Sedaris, Elle Fanning, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, John Waters, Chloe Sevigny, Liz Phair, Dan Savage, JD Samson, Ira Glass, Aubrey Plaza, Daniel Clowes, Carrie Brownstein, Paul Feig, Bethany Cosentino, Kimya Dawson, Fred Armisen, and Winnie Holzman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a young teenager, Gevinson couldn’t find what she was looking for in a teen magazine; <i>Rookie</i> is the one she created herself to fill that void. Her coolheaded intellect shines in <i>Rookie</i>, arguably the most intelligent magazine ever made for a teen-girl audience. Gevinson writes with a humble but keen authority on such serious topics as body image, self-esteem, and first encounters with street harassment. She’s equally deft at doling out useful advice, such as how to do a two-minute beehive, or how to deliver an effective bitchface. <i>Rookie</i>’s passionate staffers and faithful readers have helped make <i>Rookie</i> the strong community that it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, Gevinson has written for <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>, <i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Lula</i>, and <i>Pop</i>, and is a contributing editor for <i>Garage</i> magazine. She has been profiled in <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>, and has been on the cover of <i>Pop</i>, <i>L’Officiel</i>, <i>Zeit</i> <i>Magazin</i>, and <i>Bust</i>. As a speaker, she has made numerous presentations at venues such as IdeaCity, TEDxTeen, L2 Forum, and the <i>Economist</i> World in 2012 Festival. Last year Lady Gaga called her “the future of journalism.”</p>"

Nagasaki: The Massacre Of The Innocent And Unknowing,['Craig Collie'],"<p><b>Using contemporary diaries and letters, mainly translated from Japanese, we follow a group of Nagasaki residents from the early morning of the day of the bombing of Hiroshima to midnight on the day of the second bombing in Nagasaki</b></p>
<p>In&nbsp;a compelling narrative based on eyewitness accounts, contemporary diaries, letters, and interviews, Craig Collie collects the stories of the many levels of devastation suffered on that fateful day in Nagasaki. The war was coming to an end at last. The people of Nagasaki knew this as they desperately tried to survive each day's shortages of food and warmth—ordinary people going about their lives as normally as they could manage. People like Nagai, the doctor who'd just been told he had leukemia; Father Tamaya, the Catholic priest who'd agreed to postpone a return to his rural parish; and Koichi, the tram driver. Because the bombing of Hiroshima had been so devastating and there was severe media censorship, they knew nothing of what had befallen that city except for unbelievable stories told by a few survivors who had just now arrived. Beyond Japan, forces they could never have imagined were mustering as the Americans prepared to drop their next atomic bomb on the armaments-manufacturing city of Kokura. Bad weather, however, sent the pilots and their terrible load to Nagasaki, where a group of 169 POWs&nbsp;were digging air-raid shelters and repairing bridges near what became the bomb's epicenter. And, above the heads of them all, the machinery of wartime politics stumbled on toward its catastrophic finale. This book&nbsp;comes as close as history will allow to being there when 80,000 people died as a result of the bomb, half of them&nbsp;instantaneously. The world had changed forever and the shock waves would ripple right up to the present day, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;continue to contemplate the terrible power of a nuclear future.</p>"

Big Questions,['Anders Nilsen'],"<p>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of 2011, included on Amazon.com, <i>Publishers Weekly</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp; NPR’S Best Comics lists</p>
<p>A haunting postmodern fable, <i>Big Questions</i> is the magnum opus of Anders Nilsen, one of the brightest and most talented young cartoonists working today. This beautiful minimalist story, collected here for the first time, is the culmination of ten years and more than six hundred pages of work that details the metaphysical quandaries of the occupants of an endless plain, existing somewhere between a dream and a Russian steppe. A downed plane is thought to be a bird and the unexploded bomb that came from it is mistaken for a giant egg by the group of birds whose lives the story follows. The indifferent, stranded pilot is of great interest to the birds—some doggedly seek his approval, while others do quite the opposite, leading to tensions in the group. Nilsen seamlessly moves from humor to heartbreak. His distinctive, detailed line work is paired with plentiful white space and large, often frameless panels, conveying an ineffable sense of vulnerability and openness.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Questions</i> has roots in classic fables—the birds and snakes have more to say than their human counterparts, and there are hints of the hero’s journey, but here the easy moral that closes most fables is left open and ambiguous. Rather than lending its world meaning, Nilsen’s parable lets the questions wander where they will.</p>"
Clockwork Angels,['Kevin J. Anderson'],"<p>A remarkable collaboration that is unprecedented in its scope and realization, this exquisitely wrought novel represents an artistic project between the bestselling science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson and the multiplatinum rock band Rush. The newest album by Rush, <i>Clockwork Angels</i>, sets forth a story in Neil Peart’s lyrics that has been expanded by him and Anderson into this epic novel. In a young man’s quest to follow his dreams, he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos. He travels across a lavish and colorful world of steampunk and alchemy with lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnivals, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life. The mind-bending story is complemented with rich paintings by the five-time Juno Award winner for Best Album Design, Hugh Syme.</p>"
Mad Like Tesla: Underdog Inventors And Their Relentless Pursuit Of Clean Energy,['Tyler Hamilton'],"<p>A search for the contemporary Nikola Tesla—considered a mad scientist by his society for predicting global warming more than 100 years ago—fuels this analysis of climate issues, which introduces thinkers and inventors who are working to find possible ways out of the energy crisis. From Louis Michaud, a retired refinery engineer who claims we can harness the energy of man-made tornadoes, to a professor and a businessman who are running a company that genetically modifies algae so it can secrete ethanol naturally, these individuals and their unorthodox methods are profiled through first-person interviews, exposing the social, economic, financial, and personal barriers that prevent them from making an impact with their ideas. The existing state of green energy technologies, such as solar, wind, biofuels, smart grid, and energy storage, is also explored, creating a sense of hope against a backdrop of climate dread.</p>"

When I Get Older: The Story Behind Wavin' Flag,"[""K'naan"", 'Sol Sol']","<p>“Wavin’Flag” has become an international anthem. Its powerful words of hope have crossed generations and borders, and have made K’NAAN an international star.</p>
<p>In his first book for children, <b>When I Get Older</b>, Somali-Canadian poet, rapper, singer, and songwriter K’NAAN tells his own story. Born in Somalia, he grew up in Mogadishu. His grandfather was a renowned poet who passed on his love of words to his grandson. When the Somali Civil War began in 1991, K’NAAN was just thirteen. His mother made the difficult decision to move her family so that they could grow up in safety. First in New York and then in Toronto, K’NAAN faced many challenges.</p>
<p>Like so many other immigrants, he had to make a place for himself in a world of alien customs, clothes, and&nbsp;language. His road was a hard one: he lost many friends to violence. But K’NAAN’s love of music, and his enormous talent, became a way for him to connect with his past, with his classmates, and eventually, to millions of people around the world. Not only does K’NAAN tell a story that will inspire and encourage young readers, but he provides a brief history of the Somalian conflict. The lyrics of “Wavin’ Flag” are also included.</p>
<p>Born Keinan Abdi Warsame, K’NAAN first came to prominence when he performed a spoken word piece before the&nbsp;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1999. A member of the audience, the singer Youssou N’Dour, was so impressed that he asked K’NAAN to take part in an album and to tour with him.</p>
<p>Since then, K’NAAN has performed in more than 86 countries and has received many honors, including three Juno Awards and the BBC Radio 3 Award for World Music. During the Vancouver Olympics, he worked with other Canadian musicians and artists under the name Young Artists for Haiti to produce a charity version of “Wavin’ Flag.” The song was adapted again to become the FIFA World Cup theme song. There are now twenty-two versions of the song, which hit #1 in nineteen countries.</p>"

Riding The Black Cockatoo,"['Danalis, John.']","<p>All through his growing-up years, John Danalis's family had an Aboriginal skull on the mantelpiece; yet only as an adult after enrolling in an Indigenous Writing course&nbsp;did he ask his family where it came from and whether it should be restored to its rightful owners. This is the compelling story of how the skull of an Aboriginal man, found on the banks of the Murray River more than&nbsp;40 years ago, came to be returned to his Wamba Wamba descendants. It is a story of awakening, atonement, forgiveness, and friendship.

Part history, part detective story, part cultural discovery and emotional journey, this is a book for young and old, showing the transformative and healing power of true reconciliation.</p>"

"Me, Myself & Prague: An Unreliable Guide To Bohemia",['Rachael Weiss'],"<p>Armed with a romantic soul and a pressing need to escape her overbearing family, Rachael Weiss heads for Prague with vague plans to write&nbsp;a great&nbsp;novel and perhaps, just perhaps, fall madly in love with an exotic Czech man with high cheekbones. They make it seem so easy, those other women who write of uprooting themselves from everything they know, crossing the world and forming effortless friendships with strangers—despite not understanding a word they say—while reinventing themselves in beautiful European cities. So it's not surprising that Rachael is completely unprepared for the realities that confront her in her strange new world. However, in this warm and witty tale of life in a foreign land, Rachael, somewhat to her own surprise, finds herself gradually creating a second home in Prague, complete with an eccentric and unlikely tribe of extended family and friends; and realizes along the way that while she's been striving so hard to become someone else, she has inadvertently grown to rather like the person she has always been.</p>"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Hark! A Vagrant</i> is an uproarious romp through history and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist and comics sensation Kate Beaton. No era or tome emerges unscasthed as Beaton rightly skewers the Western world's revolutionaries, leaders, sycophants, and suffragists while equally honing her wit on the hapless heroes, heroines, and villains of the best-loved fiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is, of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture never gets old. <i>Hark! A Vagrant</i> features sexy Batman, the true stories behind classic <i>Nancy Drew</i> covers, and Queen Elizabeth doing the albatross. As the 500,000 unique monthly visitors to harkavagrant.com already know, no one turns the ironic absurdities of history and literature into comedic fodder as hilariously as Beaton.</p>"

Lucio's Ligurian Kitchen,"['Lucio Galletto', 'David Dale']","<p>Liguria is another country. They do things differently there, particularly when it comes to food. Lucio Galletto grew up in Liguria—at the eastern end of the Riviera di Levante (coast of the rising sun). He didn't realize how special his region was until he fell in love with an Australian girl and traveled 12,000 kilometers to be with her. In 2008 Lucio, and writer David Dale, along with photographer Paul Green, returned to the birthplace of ravioli and pesto and wild-greens pie to investigate how the cooking of Lucio's region had evolved during his 25-year absence. They found a new breed of chefs, farmers, and fishermen adapting traditions to the environmental concerns of the 21st century. Still using the wonderful array of local herbs, vegetables, and seafood, they apply a lighter touch and a more adventurous spirit. In this stunningly photographed book, Lucio brings us the fruits of his travels—180 delicious recipes that respect the experience of the past and anticipate the demands of the future; dishes that are fun to cook, beautiful to look at, a pleasure to share, and kind to the body. And, importantly, that pay homage to the sunny Riviera di Levante from which Lucio's culinary journey began. This book was the winner of the 2008 Gourmand Award for Best Italian Cuisine Book (Australian Category), and the 2009 Cordon d'Or Cuisine Award for Best Illustrated Culinary Book.</p>"

It shows small business owners the essentials of record keeping, and why it's crucial to a business’s success to track financial data. The book gives business owners a greater understanding of the purpose and process of record keeping and a deeper understanding of their businesses. Mohr has helped hundreds of small business owners who didn't understand the importance of record keeping and always put it off until “later.” These business owners were almost literally buried under a pile of papers, overwhelmed by the immensity of the task at hand. Mohr shows business owners how to sort through the masses of information and paperwork, record what is important, and how to use that information to grow a business for success! Eighty percent of all small businesses started this year will be gone in 5 years. As Mohr says, starting a small business can be “like driving a car in a foreign country where you don't know what the road signs are telling you.” Numbers 101 for Small Business is a new series of easy-to-understand guides for small business owners, covering such topics as bookkeeping, analyzing and tracking financial information, starting a business, growing a business, and exiting a business. Using real life examples, Mohr teaches small business owners how to beat the odds and turn their ideas into successful, growing companies."

The Ring Of Death,['Sally Spencer'],"The second in a new series featuring DCI Monika Paniatowski - Nothing could have prepared DCI Monika Paniatowski for this.

Teaching At Home: A New Approach To Tutoring Children With Autism And Asperger Syndrome,['Olga Holland'],"""Faced with the apparent inability of her autistic son Billy to learn and socialize with other children at school, Olga Holland made the difficult decision to teach him at home. Where traditional educational approaches had produced limited results, the author's own method of teaching succeeded, over a period of two years, in enabling Billy to pass the ""Gifted and Talented Education"" test that allowed him to enter a class for gifted children."" ""Teaching at Home explains the author's approach to tutoring, focused on adapting to the demands of Billy's atypical mind and respecting his vivid imaginative world, while attracting and retaining his attention. The author describes her use of sensory and memory techniques, social stories and humor, and gives useful advice on issues such as understanding body language, adapting the teaching environment, devising homework schedules and coping with distractions."" Parents of children with autism or Asperger Syndrome who are considering homeschooling will find inspiration and encouragement in this account of Billy's impressive academic progress and development of social skills."
The Penelopiad (canongate Myths),['Margaret Atwood'],"""Homer's Odyssey is not the only version of the story. Mythic material was originally oral, and also local - a myth would be told one way in one place and quite differently in another. I have drawn on material other than the Odyssey, especially for the details of Penelope's parentage, her early life and marriage, and the scandalous rumors circulating about her. ""I've chosen to give the telling of the story to Penelope and to the twelve hanged maids. The maids form a chanting and singing Chorus which focuses on two questions that must pose themselves after any close reading of the Odyssey: What led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope really up to? The story as told in the Odyssey doesn't hold water: there are too many inconsistencies. I've always been haunted by the hanged maids; and, in The Penelopiad, so is Penelope herself."" - From Margaret Atwood's foreword to The Penelopiad"

Particular features of this book are the author's photographs, taken in some of the wildest and most inaccessible parts of the world, and his own very detailed plans and illustrations of many of the buildings described."

The rest is up to you..."

Treasures Of China: The Glories Of The Kingdom Of The Dragon,['John Chinnery'],"<i>Treasures of China</i> presents a portrait of a country and civilization that has fascinated outsiders for millennia. From the mysterious Xia (ca. 2000bce) to the last imperial rulers, the Qing (1644–1912), the history of the greatest imperial power in East Asia unfolds in seven chapters illuminated by over 170 stunning photographs, from the Crucible of a Civilization through to Imperial Zenith and Decline. Each section balances informative background with illuminating commentary that explains not only the art forms (from the magnificent bronze-casting to sublime ceramics, exquisite jade carving to ornate laquerwork), but reveals the nature and significance of its rich symbolism. It makes for a fascinating account of imperial power, war and invasion, as well as a journey of discovery."
Gandhi: A Political Life,['Kathryn Tidrick'],"<p class=null1>A major reinterpretation of Gandhiâs life, politics, religion and nation</p><p>Throughout his long and turbulent career as an Indian leader, first in South Africa and then in India, Gandhi sought to fulfill his religious aspirations through politics, and to reconcile politics with his private religious discipline. The Gandhi revealed here is not the secular saint of popular renown, but a difficult and self-obsessed man driven by a sense of unique personal destiny.</p><p>Penetrating and provocative, Tidrick draws on material previously ignored by Gandhi's biographers and explores the paradoxes within his life and beliefs. Did the nationalist leader truly believe that he was not just fighting for Indian independence but also global enlightenment? Gandhi never admitted his early influences and experiences, but how important were the more esoteric ideas he first encountered in the West?</p>"
"10,000 Ways To Die: A Director's Take On The Spaghetti Western",['Alex Cox'],"<p>""40 years ago as a graduate student I wrote a book about Spaghetti Westerns, called <i>10,000 Ways to Die</i>. It’s an embarrassing tome when I look at it now: full of half-assed semiotics and other attenuated academic nonsense. In the intervening period I have had the interesting experience of being a film director. So now, when I watch these films, I’m looking at them from a different perspective. A professional perspective, maybe . . . I’m thinking about what the filmmakers intended, how they did that shot, how the director felt when his film was recut by the studio, and he was creatively and financially screwed. <i>10,000 Ways to Die</i> is an entirely new book about an under-studied subject, the Spaghetti Western, from a director’s POV. Not only have these films stood the test of time; some of them are very high art.""&nbsp; —<i>Alex Cox</i></p>"

But because I am a woman I have never had the courage to lift my hand. And because I am a prostitute, I hid my fear under layers of make-up."" —Excerpt</p>
<p>This is a new edition of the best-selling novel with a specially commissioned new Foreword by Miriam Cooke.</p>

The S Word: A Short History Of An American Tradition...socialism,['John Nichols'],"<p><b>A short, sharp, irreverent rejoinder to right-wing red-baiting.</b></p>
<p>A few months before the 2010 midterms, Newt Gingrich described the socialist infiltration of American government and media as “even more disturbing than the threats from foreign terrorists.” John Nichols offers an unapologetic retort to the return of red-baiting in American political life—arguing that socialism has a long, proud, American history. Tom Paine was enamored of early socialists, Horace Greeley employed Karl Marx as a correspondent, and Helen Keller was an avowed socialist. <b>The “S” Word</b> gives Americans back a crucial aspect of their past and makes a forthright case for socialist ideas today.</p>"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlantic salmon is an extraordinary and mysterious fish. Here, Richard Shelton combines memoir and deep scientific knowledge to reveal, from the salmon's point of view, both the riverine and marine worlds in which it lives.

They were the super rich of their times, pampered beyond belief—the early 20th century Edwardian gentry, who lived like superstars, their every desire or need catered to by an army of&nbsp;butlers, servants, footmen, housekeepers, and grooms.&nbsp;Class, money, inheritance, luxury, and snobbery dominated every aspect of the lives of the upper crust Edwardian family.&nbsp;While below stairs the staff inhabited a completely different world, their very lives dependent on servicing the rich, pandering to their masters' every whim, and rubbing shoulders with wealth and privilege. While privy to the most intimate and darkest secrets of their masters, they&nbsp;faced ruin and shame if they ventured to make the smallest step outside the boundaries of their class-ridden world. From manners and morals to etiquette and style, this book opens the doors to the reality of the era behind&nbsp;TV's favorite stately home.</p>"
The Faith Of The Faithless: Experiments In Political Theology,"['Critchley, Simon , 1960-']","<p><b>Investigation into the dangerous interdependence of politics and religion.</b></p>
<p>The return to religion has perhaps become the dominant cliché of contemporary theory, which rarely offers anything more than an exaggerated echo of a political reality dominated by religious war. Somehow, the secular age seems to have been replaced by a new era, where political action flows directly from metaphysical conflict. <b>The Faith of the Faithless</b> asks how we might respond. Following Critchley’s <b>Infinitely Demanding</b>, this new book builds on its philosophical and political framework, also venturing into the questions of faith, love, religion and violence. Should we defend a version of secularism and quietly accept the slide into a form of theism—or is there another way?</p>
<p>From Rousseau’s politics and religion to the return to St. Paul in Taubes, Agamben and Badiou, via explorations of politics and original sin in the work of Schmitt and John Gray, Critchley examines whether there can be a faith of the faithless, a belief for unbelievers. Expanding on his debate with Slavoj Žižek, Critchley concludes with a meditation on the question of violence, and the limits of non-violence.</p>"

"Irregular Army: How The Us Military Recruited Neo-nazis, Gang Members, And Criminals To Fight The War On Terror",['Matt Kennard'],"<p><b>Reveals the US military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to extremists in its ranks.</b></p>
<p>Since the launch of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars—now the longest wars in American history—the US military has struggled to recruit troops. It has responded, as Matt Kennard’s explosive investigative report makes clear, by opening its doors to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, gang members, criminals of all stripes, the overweight, and the mentally ill. Based on several years of reporting, <b>Irregular Army</b> includes extensive interviews with extremist veterans and leaders of far-right hate groups—who spoke openly of their eagerness to have their followers acquire military training for a coming domestic race war. As a report commissioned by the Department of Defense itself put it, “Effectively, the military has a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy pertaining to extremism.”</p>
<p><b>Irregular Army</b> connects some of the War on Terror’s worst crimes to this opening-up of the US military. With millions of veterans now back in the US and domestic extremism on the rise, Kennard’s book is a stark warning about potential dangers facing Americans—from their own soldiers.</p>"

F: Hu Feng's Prison Years,['Mei Zhi'],"<p><strong>China's first literary dissident's Kafkaesque journey through the prisons of the Cultural Revolution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2013 English PEN Award winner</strong></p>
<p>Hu Feng, the ‘counterrevolutionary’ leader of a banned literary school, spent twenty-five years in the Chinese Communist Party’s prison system. But back in the Party’s early days, he was one of its best known literary theoreticians and critics—at least until factional infighting, and his short fuse, made him persona non grata among the establishment.</p>
<p>His wife, Mei Zhi, shared his incarceration for many years. <em>F</em> is her account of that time, beginning ten years after her and Hu Feng’s initial arrest. She herself was eventually released, after which she navigated the party’s Byzantine prison bureaucracy searching for his whereabouts. Having finally found him, she voluntarily returned to gaol to care for him in his rage and suffering, watching his descent into madness as the excesses of the Cultural Revolution took their toll.</p>
<p>Both an intimate portrait of Mei Zhi’s life with Hu Feng and a stark account of the prison system and life under Mao, <em>F</em> is at once beautiful and harrowing.</p>"
Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords And Their Godfathers,['Anabel Hernandez'],"<p><strong>Explosive, bestselling account of Mexico’s drug cartels and the government–business nexus that enables them.</strong></p>
<p>The product of five years of investigative reporting, the subject of intense national controversy, and the source of death threats that forced the National Human Rights Commission to assign two full-time bodyguards to Anabel Hernández, <em>The Lords of el Narco</em> has been a publishing and political sensation in Mexico.</p>
<p>The definitive history and anatomy of the drug cartels and the “war on drugs” that has cost more than 50,000 lives in just five years, the book explains in riveting detail how Mexico became a base for the mega-cartels of Latin America and one of the most violent places on the planet. Hernández reveals the complicity of Mexico’s government and business elite. At every turn, she names names—not just the <em>narcos</em> and their immediate accomplices, but also the politicians, policemen, functionaries, judges and entrepreneurs who have collaborated with them.</p>
<p>Hernández became a journalist after her father was kidnapped and killed and the police refused to investigate without a bribe. She gained national prominence in 2001 with her exposure of pharaonic spending on housekeeping at the presidential palace. All her previous books have also focused on corruption at the summit of power, under presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón.</p>"
"Film After Film: (or, What Became Of 21st Century Cinema?)",['J. Hoberman'],"<p><strong>How the digital turn and 9/11 have changed motion picture history.</strong></p>
<p>In this sly and thought-provoking volume, J. Hoberman turns an erudite eye to the study of twenty-first-century cinema and finds that, only a dozen years into the new millennium, the world of movies has already experienced a revolutionary transformation.</p>
<p>The advent of new digital technology has displaced the medium of photographic film—and, perhaps, the reality on which it once depended. With locations, sets and cameras now optional, the history of motion pictures has become the history of animation.</p>
<p>This sea change in filmmaking spanned the 2000 American presidential election and the trauma of 9/11, events that reshaped world politics and left an indelible imprint on the emerging aesthetic of the new century’s cinema. A rupture opened up in the evolution of film, presaging, as Susan Sontag forlornly predicted a few years earlier, the death of cinephilia, or at least cinephilia as we know it.</p>
<p>Witty and allusive, in the style of classic film theorist/critics such as André Bazin and Siegfried Kracauer, Film After Film expands on a much-discussed era-defining <em>Artforum</em> article by Hoberman before moving on to a chronicle of the Bush years in cinema (featuring reviews from Hoberman’s final decade at the <em>Village Voice</em>). The book concludes with considerations of the twenty-one central movies of the twenty-first century, which include works by Lars von Trier and Jia Zhangke as well as the hi-tech spectacles <em>WALL-E</em> and <em>Avatar</em>.</p>"

"First As Tragedy, Then As Farce",['Slavoj Zizek'],"<p>Billions of dollars have been hastily poured into the global banking system in a frantic attempt at financial stabilization. So why has it not been possible to bring the same forces to bear in addressing world poverty and environmental crisis?</p>
<p>In this take-no-prisoners analysis, Slavoj Zizek frames the moral failures of the modern world in terms of the epoch-making events of the first decade of this century. What he finds is the old one-two punch of history: the jab of tragedy, the right hook of farce.

"Dress Accessories, C. 1150- C. 1450 (medieval Finds From Excavations In London)","['Geoff Egan', 'Frances Pritchard']","<p>Brooches, rings, buckles, pendants, buttons, purses and other accessories were part of everyday dress in the middle ages. Over two thousand such items dating from the period 1150-1450 are described and discussed here, all found in recent archaeological excavations in London - then as now one of western Europe's most cosmopolitan cities, its social and economic activity compounded by the waterside bustle of the Thames. These finds constitute the most extensive and varied group of such accessories yet recovered in Britain, and their close dating and the scientific analysis carried out on them have been highly revealing. Important results published here for the first time show, for example, the popularity of shoddy, mass-produced items in base metals during the high middle ages and enable researchers to identify the varied products of rival traditions of manufacture mentioned in historical sources. Anyone needing accurate information on period costume will welcome this book, which will appeal to the general reader interested in costume and design, as well as to archaeologists and historians. THE AUTHORS are members of staff of the Museum of London.</p>"
Allen Brown's English Castles,['R. Allen Brown'],"<p>Castle studies have been shaped and defined over the past half-century by the work of R. Allen Brown. His classic English Castles, renamed here to acknowledge its definitive approach to the subject, has never been superseded by other more recent studies, and is still the foundation study of the English, and Welsh, castles built between the Norman Conquest and the mid 1500s. As the subject evolved, so too did this book, and for the most recent edition a considerable amount of French comparative material was added, though it remains essentially a study of English castles. For Allen Brown, castles were fortified residences (or residential fortresses), and developed, from European precursors, to support political and social realities as the Norman and Angevin kings secured their realm. Once these political ends had been largely met, the castle and castle-building entered a period of decline, and domestic and military interests went in opposite directions. This book, with numerous photographs and plans, remains the outstanding guide to the origins, purpose and identity of the great castles of England and Wales. R. ALLEN BROWN was also the author of The Normans, The Norman Conquest of England and The Normans and the Norman Conquest and founder of the Battle Conference on Anglo-Norman Studies, now in its twenty-sixth year.</p>"

Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle,"['Žižek, Slavoj']","<p>In order to render the strange logic of dreams, Freud quoted the old joke about the borrowed kettle: (1) I never borrowed a kettle from you, (2) I returned it to you unbroken, (3) the kettle was already broken when I got it from you. Such an enumeration of inconsistent arguments, of course, confirms exactly what it attempts to deny—that I returned a broken kettle to you ...</p>
<p>That same inconsistency, Zizek argues, characterized the justification of the attack on Iraq: A link between Saddam’s regime and al-Qaeda was transformed into the threat posed by the regime to the region, which was then further transformed into the threat posed to everyone (but the US and Britain especially) by weapons of mass destruction. When no significant weapons were found, we were treated to the same bizarre logic: OK, the two labs we found don’t really prove anything, but even if there are no WMD in Iraq, there are other good reasons to topple a tyrant like Saddam . . .</p>
<p>Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle analyzes the background that such inconsistent argumentation conceals and, simultaneously, cannot help but highlight: what were the actual ideological and political stakes of the attack on Iraq? In classic Zizekian style, it spares nothing and nobody, neither pathetically impotent pacifism nor hypocritical sympathy with the suffering of the Iraqi people.</p>

Something needed to happen quickly and be of considerable impact.&nbsp;The April 1942 Doolittle Raid on Japan was a way to achieve this. This book examines the planning, execution, and aftermath of this innovative, daring and risky attack, which would show that the Japanese navy and air forces were anything but invincible.</p>"
"Genes, Cells and Brains: The Promethean Promises of the New Biology","['Hilary Rose', 'Steven Rose']","<p>Our fates lie in our genes and not in the stars, said James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA. But Watson could not have predicted the scale of the industry now dedicated to this new frontier. Since the launch of the multibillion-dollar Human Genome Project, the biosciences have promised miracle cures and radical new ways of understanding who we are. But where is the new world we were promised?</p><p>In <b>Genes, Cells and Brains</b>, feminist sociologist Hilary Rose and neuroscientist Steven Rose take on the bioscience industry and its claims. Examining the establishment of biobanks, the rivalries between public and private genesequencers, and the rise of stem cell research, they ask why the promised cornucopia of health benefits has failed to emerge and reveal the questionable enterprise that has grown out of bioethics. The human body is becoming a commodity, and the unfulfilled promises of the science behind this revolution suggest profound failings in genomics itself.</p>"

Smart Things To Know About Six Sigma,['Andrew Berger'],"<p>Six Sigma is a target for operational performance and the name originates from the statistical term that uses the lower case Greek letter to mean standard deviation. If you improve the sigma (or standard deviation) of any process you are in effect reducing failure or defect rate of that process. But don’t let this description put you off. Six Sigma has long left its precise definition behind. It has now turned into a generic term – one which denotes the disciplined and relentless pursuit of higher levels of quality and lower levels of cost. And with companies such as GE, Honeywell, Texas and Polaroid claiming to have delivered financial benefits of more than $1 billion it’s easy to see why Six Sigma is growing at a phenomenal rate - across all sectors and geographies.</p>
<p>In <i>Smart Things to Know about Six Sigma</i> Andrew Berger shows managers and execs how to bridge the gap between the theory and the practical applications of Six Sigma. Berger offers a unique and integrated approach combining best practice examples with a practical mechanism for implementation.</p>
<p>Smart managers know they can’t ignore the growing trend, and in <i>Smart Things to Know About Six Sigma</i> Andrew Berger reveals the tools for becoming a Six Sigma Black Belt:</p>
<p>What are the problems you could solve with Six Sigma? How do you select the right projects? How do you devise the timescale?</p>
<p>The main process for Six Sigma is DMAIC (Define – Measure &amp; Analyse – Improve – Control), and is the best methodology for ensuring that targets are met.</p>
<p>Time spent in reconnaissance is rarely wasted. Learn what the ‘Define’ and ‘Project Charter’ phase is. How do you get started?</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis is the art and the science of Six Sigma. What are the best practice tools and benchmarks to help project teams in the Measure and Analyse phase?</p>
<p>Next step. It’s time to move to the IMPROVE phase. No problem… this is when the fun begins. But what should the project team really want to achieve during this phase? It’s all about prioritising and testing solutions and building the case for change.</p>
<p>Change is only complete when people in the organization adopt a ‘new way of doing things’ as the accepted way of doing things. But what are the wider implications for taking on the change and how do you sustain the change? Welcome to the CONTROL phase.</p>
<p>How do you successfully manage Six Sigma change to deliver real financial benefits? (Hiieeeeyah. Please come forward and pick up your belt).</p>
<p>Six Sigma can be used to improve any process. From product cycle times to defects reduction, and it can be used in almost any range of business. From high street financial institutions, to hospitals and to cardboard box manufacturers. In the next 3-4 years, you’ll see around 60% of companies implementing some form of Six Sigma. Be Smart. And see what all the fuss is about…</p>

The Secret Language Of Churches & Cathedrals: Decoding The Sacred Symbolism Of Christianity's Holy Buildings,['Richard Stemp'],"<p>Thanks to books and films like <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> and its sequel, <i>Angels and Demons</i>, interest in secret religious symbols has never been greater. This carefully researched guide takes the reader into some of the world's most famous churches, decoding messages that are hidden in plain sight-in stained-glass windows, statuary, patterned flooring, ornamentation, and even the buildings' architectural design: Why do fierce beasts and grotesque faces peer from the walls?

Sex Pistols: The Graphic Novel,"['Jim Mccarthy', 'Steve Parkhouse']","<p>Thanks to Steve Parkhouse's wonderfully vivid illustrations and Jim McCarthy's clever distillation of the script that rewrote rock 'n roll and much else besides, the Pistols' story returns to the rough and tumble of the comic strip from which it derived to much of its initial inspiration.</p>
<p>England's original punks explode from the pages with the same disrespect for authority that had the British establishment up in arms during the Queen's 25th anniversary jubilee.</p>
<p>And no one would have enjoyed this take on the Pistols more than the tale's real casualty, Sid Vicious, who devoured comics almost as much as he did the destructive stuff.<br>

Studio Ghibli: The Films Of Hayao Miyazaki And Isao Takahata,"['Colin Odell', 'Michelle Le Blanc']","<p>The animations of Japan’s Studio Ghibli are amongst the highest regarded in the movie industry.

No other film studio, animation or otherwise, comes close to matching Ghibli for pure cinematic experience. All their major works are examined here, as well the early output of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, exploring the cultural and thematic threads that bind these films together.</p>"

"The Gay Gospels: Good News For Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, And Transgendered People",['Keith Sharpe'],"<p>The place of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people in the Christian churches is a highly controversial issue. The stance of all the mainline churches is that homosexuality is sinful and incompatible with Christianity. In seeking to respond to attacks on their lives, identities and relationships LGBT Christians have moved over recent decades from a defensive position to a more affirmative position which asserts that there is evidence in the Bible and the Jesus tradition of validated homoerotic experience. This book presents a systematic overview of both the defensive and affirmative positions. In part one, The Defensive Testament, each of the so-called 'biblical texts of terror' used to demonise LGBT people is considered in turn and found wanting. None of them has anything to say about consensual same sex love. In part two, The Affirmative Testament, homoerotic elements in various Bible stories including the healing of the centurion's servant, Jesus and the beloved disciple, David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi are revealed to make visible the place of LGBT lives in the Biblical tradition. Taken together, these two testaments forcefully champion the equality of LGBT people in the Kingdom of God and represent a formidable challenge to ecclesiastical homophobia.</p>"

Hazel: A Life Of Lady Lavery 1880-1935,['Sinead McCoole'],"<p>Until now Lady Lavery has been remembered for the numerous portraits by her husband, the painter John Lavery, celebrated in ""The Municipal Gallery Re-visited' by W.B. Yeats, This first biography of Hazel tells the story the pictures cannot: ow a girl from boomtown Chicago became one of the most stylish society hostesses in London, and turned her husband's studio into a hub of Anglo-Irish diplomacy, from the 1921 Treaty negotiations through the tumultuous early years of the Irish Free State. Using hitherto-unpublished letters and scrapbooks assembled by Hazel herself, Sinead McCoole gives an intimate account of Hazel's artistic and political preoccupations, and of her extraordinary effect upon the male politicians of Ireland and Britain, for whom she and her salon often represented the only common ground.</p>
<p>Romance and politics converged in her relationships with two hard men of nationalist Ireland who each met violent deaths: Michael Collins, whose view on the Treaty were influenced by Hazel, and Kevin O'Higgins, whose passionate letters to Hazel reveal the inner man beneath the political carapace. Hazel also forged durable social and political alliances with the pillars of British government - Winston Churchill, Ramsay MacDonald and Lord Londonderry among other - while relishing her friendships with leading writers and artists of the day such as George Bernard Shaw, J.M. Barrie, Lennox Robinson and Evelyn Waugh.</p>
<p>This lavishly illustrated, richly documented life of Lady Lavery relates how one beautiful American woman reinvented herself as 'a simple Irish girl' came to personify Eirr on Ireland's banknotes, 'living and dying ... as though some ballad-singer had sung it all'.</p>"

The Boys Of '67: Charlie Company's War In Vietnam (general Military),['Andrew Wiest'],"<p>When the 160 men of Charlie Company (4th Battalion/47th Infantry/9th ID) were drafted by the US Army in May 1966, they were part of the wave of conscription that would swell the American military to 80,000 combat troops in theater by the height of the war in 1968. In the spring of 1966, the war was still popular and the draftees of Charlie Company saw their service as a rite of passage. But by December 1967, when the company rotated home, only 30 men were not casualties—and they were among the first vets of the war to be spit on and harassed by war protestors as they arrived back the U.S.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In his new book, <i>The Boys of ’67</i>, Andy Wiest, the award-winning author of <i>Vietnam’s Forgotten Army</i> and <i>The Vietnam War 1956-1975</i>, examines the experiences of a company from the only division in the Vietnam era to train and deploy together in similar fashion to WWII’s famous 101st Airborne Division.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Wiest interviewed more than 50 officers and enlisted men who served with Charlie Company, including the surviving platoon leaders and both of the company’s commanders. (One of the platoon leaders, Lt Jack Benedick, lost both of his legs, but went on to become a champion skier.) In addition, he interviewed 15 family members of Charlie Company veterans, including wives, children, parents, and siblings. Wiest also had access to personal papers, collections of letters, a diary, an abundance of newspaper clippings, training notebooks, field manuals, condolence letters, and photographs from before, during, and after the conflict.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As Wiest shows, the fighting that Charlie Company saw in 1967 was nearly as bloody as many of the better publicized battles, including the infamous ‘Ia Drang’ and ‘Hamburger Hill.’ As a result, many of the surviving members of Charlie Company came home with what the military now recognizes as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder—a diagnosis that was not recognized until the late 1970s and was not widely treated until the 1980s. Only recently, after more than 40 years, have many members of Charlie Company achieved any real and sustained relief from their suffering.&nbsp;</p>"

Dali,['Eric Shanes'],"As a one of the foremost painters of the 20th century, Dalí, like Picasso and Warhol, can boast of having overturned the art of the previous century and directed contemporary art toward its present incarnation.

A megalomaniac and an artist who above all understood the force of marketing and publicity, Dalí disorients the viewer in order to draw him into the artist's world. On his canvases, images and colours crash together to express and mock certain ideas, creating a subversive eroticism that taps into the subconscious of the avid voyeurs that we are.<br>
The author, Eric Shanes, explores the twists and turns of Dalí's mad genius, commenting on the masterpieces of the painter so as to show the diversity and scope of his talent, leaving the reader blown away and bewitched by this Prince of Metamorphosis. This work opens up the sweet, mad universe of this megalomaniac genius and invites us to let ourselves be overcome . . . Dalí is, first and foremost, an absolute."

Battles Of The Dark Ages: British Battlefields Ad 410 To 1065,"['Marren, Peter.']","Britain was a place of conflict in the Dark Ages, between the departure of the Romans and the Norman Conquest. Clashes of allegiance, competition for territory and resources, and intense rivalries among the warlords and kings gave rise to frequent outbreaks of fighting. This was the time of legendary military leaders, like Arthur, Alfred and Canute, and of literally hundreds of battles.

Drawing upon the latest scholarship, this book gathers 100 of the most significant sinographs, placing them within their historical, artistic, and cultural contexts. Each word is traced through the ages, from picture drawings to multifaceted modern characters, and every entry explores the characters’ significance in Chinese culture, from words such as dragon, phoenix, mountain, and heaven to abstract concepts of love, truth, wisdom, and luck. Superb calligraphy accompanies the text–often shown full-page for impact—along with lavish reproductions of Chinese brush paintings, scrolls, ceramics, and textiles."

This beautiful, blinkered couple do the unthinkable and run away from home, abandoning their two teenage children. Their sudden departure is an act of glorious wilfulness. Life in the countries they visit is nothing more than a backdrop to their love affair.

Gustave Courbet (pageperfect Nook Book),['Georges Riat'],"Courbet, ein Kind des Materialismus und des Positivismus,<br>
war ohne Zweifel einer der komplexesten Maler des 19.<br>
Jahrhunderts. Er symbolisierte die Ablehnung der Traditionen<br>

Wahrheit zu konfrontieren, dass er die Malerei von<br>
konventionellen Regeln befreite. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an war<br>

Dieser Text über Courbet ist das Resultat jahrelanger<br>
intensiver Forschungen und analysiert sorgfältig<br>

American Grafitti (pageperfect Nook Book),['Margo Thompson'],"Das vorliegende Buch präsentiert eine neue Analyse der Verbindungen zwischen dem Kunstgenre Graffiti und dem Werk Jean-Michel Basquiats und spricht insofern sicherlich ein breites Publikum an. Es gibt gegenwärtig nur äuserst wenige Studien zu dieser Thematik, was diese originelle Analyse umso wichtiger macht.

Fiesta Femenina: Celebrating Women In Mexican Folktale,['Mary-joan Gerson'],"Deep in the lush Mexican forests, amidst the tall mountains and the rushing rivers, dwells a great goddess.

Amerikanischer Realismus (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Der Amerikanische Realismus ist weder eine Kunstbewegung noch eine Schule, vielmehr ist er ein durch eine ausergewöhnliche Vielfalt gekennzeichnetes Phänomen, das nur schwer zu definieren ist. Er wird oft als der erste eigene Kunststil der USA betrachtet und zerfällt in eine Reihe von Kategorien, etwa den aregionalen Realismus"", den Genre-Realismus oder auch den Porträt-Realismus, je nach Ort, Sujet und Modell. So könnte sich ein Maler, der die indianischen Ureinwohner im Westen der USA oder die Seeleute an der Ostküste porträtiert, durchaus als Vertreter des Regionalen<br>
Porträt-Realismus bezeichnen.<br>
Eine einheitliche Auffassung des Amerikanischen Realismus ist daher kaum möglich. Doch unbesehen aller Unterschiede gibt es eine frappierende Gemeinsamkeit der ihm zugeordneten Künstler: ihr Anliegen, der typisch amerikanischen Lebensart (dem American Way of Life) sowie ihrem Verständnis von Freiheit Ausdruck zu verleihen. Natürlich hängt das Ergebnis der Bemühungen jedes Einzelnen von seinem subjektiven Empfinden, seiner individuellen Wahrnehmung, seinem Intellekt, seinem familiären Hintergrund, seiner Erziehung und Ausbildung ab und nicht zuletzt auch von regionalen und ethnischen Einflüssen. Das Spektrum dieser heterogenen Kunst reicht von Winslow Homers poetisch angehauchten Aquarellen aus den 1860er Jahren über die fast unheimlich und stark symbolträchtig wirkenden Bilder eines Andrew Wyeth bis hin zu den in melancholisches Licht getauchten Szenen eines Edward Hopper der 50er und 60er Jahre des 20. Jahrhunderts.<br>
Dieser Band präsentiert ein über hundert Jahre umfassendes Kaleidoskop des Amerikanischen Realismus. Den Anfang machen US-amerikanische Maler, die noch stark der Tradition der europäischen Kunst verpflichtet sind und sich allmählich von dieser lossagen; am Ende haben wir die Vertreter der modernen Generation, deren auf amerikanischem Boden gewachsene schöpferische und teilweise rebellische Ideen auch in Europa groses Aufsehen erregen und die ihre Eigenständigkeit als eine Art neue Pioniere beweisen.<br>"
Fra Angelico (pageperfect Nook Book),['Stephan Beissel'],"Der Maler Fra Angelico hat als einer der ersten die von dem<br>

Anmut und Gefühl zu betonen, ordnen ihn in die Reihe der<br>
wichtigsten Maler der Frührenaissance ein. Mit Hilfe einer<br>
Reihe grosartiger Illustrationen und einer künstlerischen<br>

Michelangelo (pageperfect Nook Book),['EugÃ¨ne MÃ¼ntz'],"Der Name Michelangelo ist verbunden mit monumentalen Werken wie der Sixtinischen Kapelle, dem David, der Pietà und unzähligen anderen. Der französische Schriftsteller Stendhal bemerkte in seiner Geschichte der italienischen Malerei, dass azwischen der griechischen Antike und Michelangelo nichts existiert als mehr oder weniger begabte Nachahmungen"". Das Opus Michelangelos hat unfraglich die Prüfung der Zeit überstanden, aber wie war es möglich, dass er in wenigen Jahren künstlerische Geheimnisse aufdeckte, die seinen antiken Vorfahren in nichts nachstanden?<br>
Als kreatives Genie und Übermensch war Michelangelo ein unvergleichlicher Künstler der italienischen Renaissance und er wird aufgrund seiner Errungenschaften sowie seines Einflusses vollkommen zu Recht an die Seite Leonardo da Vincis gestellt. Dieses Buch versammelt Michelangelos beeindruckendsten Werke in einem praktischen Format und ist so das ideale Geschenk für alle Kunstliebhaber."

Frida Kahlo (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Detrás de los retratos de Frida Kahlo se ocultan tanto la historia de su vida como la de su obra. Es precisamente esta combinación la que atrae al espectador. La obra de Frida es un testimonio de su vida. Pocas veces se puede aprender tanto acerca de un artista con sólo contemplar lo que él inscribe dentro del marco de sus cuadros. Frida Kahlo es sin lugar a dudas la ofrenda de México a la historia del arte. Tenía apenas dieciocho años cuando un terrible accidente cambió su vida para siempre, dejándola discapacitada y agobiada de un dolor físico permanente. Pero su carácter explosivo, su férrea determinación y su inquebrantable ahínco la ayudaron a formar su talento artístico.<br>
<br>
A su lado estuvo siempre el gran pintor y muralista mexicano Diego Rivera, cuyo obsesivo donjuanismo no le impidió a Frida conquistarlo con sus encantos, su talento y su inteligencia. Ella aprendió rápidamente a aprovechar el éxito de su compañero para explorar el mundo, creando así su propio legado y rodeándose con gran esmero de un muy estrecho grupo de amigos. Su vida personal fue turbulenta: muchas veces dejó de lado su relación con Diego mientras cultivaba sus relaciones amorosas con personas de ambos sexos. Pese a esto, Frida y Diego lograron salvar su deteriorado idilio. La historia y las pinturas que Frida nos dejó revelan el valiente relato de una mujer en constante búsqueda de sí misma."

Virgin Portraits (pageperfect Nook Book),['Klaus Carl'],"During the Renaissance, Italian painters would traditionally depict the wives of their patrons as Madonnas, often rendering them more beautiful than they actually were. Over centuries in religious paintings, the Madonna has been presented as the clement and protective mother of God. However, with the passing of time, Mary gradually lost some of her spiritual characteristics and became more mortal and accessible to human sentiments. Virgin Portraits illuminates this evolution and contains impressive works by Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rubens, Fouquet, Dalí, and Kahlo."
Egon Schiele (pageperfect Nook Book),['Jeanette Zwingenberger'],"Egon Schiele (1890-1918) ist einer der grosen Maler des Expressionismus. Von Gustav Klimt unterrichtet brach er, wie seine Vorgänger der Wiener Secession, schon früh mit den Traditionen österreichischer Kunst. In seinen zahlreichen Selbstporträts und Aktmalereien bewahrte Schiele stets seine erotische und sinnliche, aber auch qualvolle Kunstvorstellung. Die Texte und Bilder in dieser Great Masters-Ausgabe zeigen das ausergewöhnliche Talent eines Künstlers, der unglücklicherweise bereits im Alter von 28 Jahren an Krankheit verstarb."
Antoni Gaudí (pageperfect Nook Book),['Jeremy Roe'],"El libro lleva a cabo un análisis crítico de la arquitectura de Antoni Gaudí, de acuerdo con las últimas investigaciones académicas, e incluye ilustraciones documentales y un ensayo fotográfico de su trabajo. Los dos primeros capítulos ofrecen una introducción a la vida de Gaudí y al contexto sociocultural de la Barcelona en la que desarrolló su extraordinario y original estilo. Los siguientes cuatro capítulos ofrecen un estudio pormenorizado de su trabajo. Los dos primeros hacen un seguimiento del desarrollo de Gaudí como arquitecto en función de sus aportes a dos áreas de la arquitectura. En primer lugar, sus obras seculares y domésticas, como la excepcional Casa Milà, y, en segundo lugar, sus diseños y edificaciones completas para la Iglesia, entre las que se incluyen el palacio episcopal de Astorga. Los dos últimos capítulos ofrecen una visión de la obra de Gaudí a lo largo de gran parte de su vida, pero se centran en los edificios construidos bajo el impulso de su mecenas, Eusebi Güell, por un lado, y en la monumental iglesia de la Sagrada Familia, célebre en todo el mundo. Asimismo, se ofrece un análisis crítico de todos sus edificios para poder identificar el desarrollo de su característico estilo arquitectónico."
Pablo Picasso (pageperfect Nook Book),['Victoria Charles'],"Este libro contiene numerosas obras creadas por Picasso entre 1881 y 1914. El primer estilo del artista está marcado por la influencia de El Greco, Munch y Toulouse-Lautrec, quien lo descubrió cuando aún era un estudiante en Barcelona. Picasso, fascinado por la expresión psicológica durante su Período Azul (1901-1904), manifestó una miseria moral: sus escenas de género, naturalezas muertas y retratos están impregnados de melancolía. La pasión de Picasso luego se volcó a las figuras de acróbatas: el Período Circo.<br>
Desde 1904, la fecha de su llegada a París, su estética evolucionó considerablemente. La influencia de Cézanne y las esculturas ibéricas lo condujeron hacia el cubismo, caracterizado por la multiplicación de los puntos de vista sobre los planos de la pintura. Además de la selección de las primeras pinturas de Picasso, este libro presenta numerosos dibujos, esculturas y fotografías."
Me And My Cat,['Carmel Reilly'],"Every cat owner believes that his or her cat understands every word that they say. Every cat owner believes that cats are far more intelligent than dogs - they're just too cool to show it. Every cat owner believes that their cat should be on TV starring in advertisements for everything from furniture and carpets to central heating and, yes, cat food. And those Andrex puppies have had it their own way for far too long... Every cat owner, in fact, is a cat lover. If they're not cat lovers when the cat first comes along - you don't purchase a cat, they choose to live with you - then they will be within a very short space of time. There are stories, of course, that every cat owner loves to tell. It may be that the cat became hugely and unusually distressed the day a relative died unexpectedly on the other side of town. It may be about how the cat is a constant source of comfort during bad times, or how the cat faces up to urban foxes in the garden. It may simply be a story about how the cat is a loving companion. Cat lovers simply love telling cat stories!"

Viet Cong And Nva Tunnels And Fortifications Of The Vietnam War,"['Gordon Rottman', 'Lee Ray', 'Chris Taylor']","Field fortifications and tunnel systems are typically thought of as defensive and active protective measures, but the VC/NVA also employed them offensively. It was common for extensive field works to be constructed to support assaults and sieges on US fire-support bases and remote camps. Their tactics reflected attempts to counter the massive firepower they faced: when directly engaging the enemy they employed “hugging” tactics (moving in and remaining closely engaged, even intermingling units, to prevent the enemy from bringing his artillery and close air support to bear). Their field works included defended villages, base camps, fortified complexes, hilltop defenses, trench systems, individual fighting positions, crew-served weapon positions, bunkers, caches, and extensive tunnel systems. Camouflage and deceptive measures, and the employment of obstacles and booby traps went hand-in-hand with such field works. This book examines these unique fortifications."

Byzantine Art (pageperfect Nook Book),['Charles Bayet'],"For more than a millennium, from its creation in 330 CE until its fall in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was a cradle of artistic effervescence that is only beginning to be rediscovered. Endowed with the rich heritage of Roman, Eastern, and Christian cultures, Byzantine artists developed an architectural and pictorial tradition, marked by symbolism, whose influence extended far beyond the borders of the Empire. Today, Italy, North Africa, and the Near East preserve the vestiges of this sophisticated artistic tradition, with all of its mystical and luminous beauty. The magnificence of the palaces, churches, paintings, enamels, ceramics, and mosaics from this civilisation guarantees Byzantine art's powerful influence and timelessness."

Remington (pageperfect Nook Book),['Frederic Remington'],"Frederic Remington (1861-1909) was one of the last American artists to offer his contemporaries a vision of the American Old West, that wild terrain with its immense prairies, herds of bison and the last American Indians. A painter, but above all an illustrator popular in his time, Remington skilfully captivated the public's attention by presenting a realistic view of this primitive way of life on the brink of submitting to invading civilisation. Authentically capturing its roughness, force and also its colours, Remington quickly became the representative of American painting in the eyes of the world. Though he mainly concentrated on the attitudes of his characters and animals and not on his landscapes, his photographic style, with a nearly impressionist touch, renewed a genre and lent an added realism to his subjects. <br>
Painter and sculptor, Remington also knew how to sculpturally express the ardour of these strong men and wild animals battling with the evolution of a new continent. The galloping horse, still recognized today as his signature subject, magnificently illustrates the power of freedom emanating from these masterpieces."
Kahlo (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Frida Kahlos Portraits erzählen die Geschichte ihres Lebens - ein Werk, das aus Klagen der Wut und Verzweiflung entstand und sich mit einer kraftvollen und künstlerisch einzigartigen Schaffenskraft verbindet. Schon im Alter von sechs Jahren erkrankte Kahlo an Kinderlähmung und mit 18 Jahren sollte ein folgenschwerer Busunfall ihr Leben für immer verändern. Sie trug bleibende körperliche Schäden davon und litt für den Rest ihres Lebens an fortwährenden Schmerzen. Nur ihrem explosiven Charakter, ihrer unbeirrbaren Bestimmtheit und harten Arbeit ist die Entwicklung ihres künstlerischen Talents zu verdanken.<br>
Frida Kahlo gelang es, sich selbst einen Freiraum in der chauvinistischen Gesellschaft Mexikos zu schaffen, und dies, trotz ihres zweifachen Nachteils: körperliche Behinderung und weibliches Geschlecht. Ihr Werk hat heute, aufgrund seiner Innovativität und seiner multikulturellen Werte, eine grose Bedeutung im kulturellen Erbe ihrer Heimat Mexiko. Ihr Leben und die Bilder, die Kahlo schuf, offenbaren die einzigartige Geschichte einer couragierten Frau auf der langen Reise zu sich selbst."

Gently Floating,['Hunter Alan'],"Gently wades through a torrent of suspects when a body is found floating face down in the river. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing - that's if you can call having too many suspects, too many potential murderers, 'a good thing'. What Gently has to work out is which of them had the cold blooded nerve to smash the victim's skull and dump him in the river."
O'keeffe (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) zählt zu den bekanntesten US-amerikanischen Malerinnen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Zwischen ihrer Geburt und ihrem Tod spielte sich die gesamte Geschichte der Moderne in den Vereinigten Staaten wie in einem Hollywoodfilm ab. In einer Epoche, in der Frauen für eine Rolle als Ehefrau und Mutter bestimmt waren, widersetzte sich Georgia O'Keeffe den Konventionen und wurde gleichzeitig die Ehefrau von Alfred Stieglitz, berühmter Fotograf und charismatische Figur in der Entwicklung des modernen Amerika. Motive ihrer an der Grenze zur gegenstandslosen Malerei angesiedelten und als Interpretation der Welt in weiblicher Begrifflichkeit verstandenen Werke sind häufig Blumen, Flammen und später auch Stadtansichten, Wüstenlandschaften oder Knochen. Zugleich wird in den reinen Bildlandschaften O'Keeffes eine erotische Ausstrahlung wahrgenommen. Der Autor zeichnet hier sowohl den persönlichen Lebensweg einer modernen Frau als auch die Entwicklung ihres Schaffensprozesses nach. Dabei begnügt er sich nicht damit, die persönlichen Erfahrungen heranzuziehen, welche die Künstlerin geformt haben, sondern er bezieht zudem auch ihren künstlerischen Nachlass mit ein und berücksichtigt auserdem den in neuerer Zeit erforschten Zusammenhang von Weiblichkeit und künstlerischem Schaffen."

Gothic Art (PagePerfect NOOK Book),"['Victoria Charles', 'Klaus Carl']","Gothic art finds its roots in the powerful architecture of the cathedrals of northern France. It is a medieval art movement that evolved throughout Europe over more than 200 years.<br>Leaving curved Roman forms behind, the architects started using flying buttresses and pointed arches to open up cathedrals to daylight. A period of great economic and social change, the Gothic era also saw the development of a new iconography celebrating the Holy Mary - in drastic contrast to the fearful themes of dark Roman times. Full of rich changes in all of the various art forms (architecture, sculpture, painting, etc.), Gothic art paved the way for the Italian Renaissance and International Gothic movement."

Gustav Klimt (pageperfect Nook Book),['Patrick Bade'],"Gustav Klimt (1862-1918), fondatore del movimento della Secessione Viennese, fu uno degli artisti più influenti della fine del XIX secolo. Attraverso questo movimento Klimt espresse il suo assoluto disprezzo per l'arte ""ufficiale"", caratterizzata dall'opposizione al cambiamento e dal rifiuto a legittimare una certa visione del Modernismo.

Icons (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nikodim Pavlovich Kondakov'],"Icon painting has reached its zenith in Ukraine between the 11th and 18th centuries. This art is appealing because of its great openness to other influences - the obedience to the rules of Orthodox Christianity in its early stages, the borrowing from Roman heritage or later to the Western breakthroughs - combined with a never compromised assertion of a distinctly Slavic soul and identity.<br>
This book presents a handpicked and representative selection of works from the 11th century to the late Baroque period."

The Portrait Of Mr W.h,"['Wilde, Oscar , 1854-1900']","In 1609, the first edition of Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i> was published, featuring the mysterious dedication: “To Mr W.H.” Ever since, the identity of Mr W.H. has been the subject of a series of fascinating theories—but none quite so ingenious as that of Oscar Wilde’s <i>The Portrait of Mr W.H.</i> Cambridge scholar Cyril Graham spent his days performing in Shakespeare’s plays, and, being somewhat effeminate in nature, he was cast in the female roles. And then he made a rather startling discovery—the “Mr W.H.” to whom Shakespeare dedicated his Sonnets could be none other than Will Hughes, the boy-actor of Shakespeare’s plays! But when no one shares his conviction, he resolves to find another way to convince them."
The Nva And Viet Cong,"['Kenneth Conboy', 'Simon McCouaig']","In 1940 Japan placed Vietnam under military occupation, restricting the local French administration to a figurehead authority. Seizing the opportunity, the Communists organised a Vietnamese independence league, the Viet Minh, whose armed forces became known as the PAVN (more commonly known to the West as the Vietcong, or NVA) and prepared to launch an uprising against the French at the war's end. This text details the history, organisation and uniforms of the People's Army of Vietnam from its origins in the fight against colonialism, through two separate wars against the US and Khmer Rouge, to its role in the modern era."

Anthony Van Dyck (pageperfect Nook Book),['Victoria Charles'],"La carrera del pintor flamenco del siglo XVII, Van Dyck, fue tan corta como deslumbrante. Fue alumno de Rubens y se convirtió rápidamente en el pintor favorito de príncipes y reyes y fue el retratista de las familias inglesas e italianas de la nobleza. Con sus composiciones rigurosas, Van Dyck dotaba a sus modelos de dignidad, grandeza y espiritualidad. Damas orgullosas, señores retozando con sus caballos: Van Dyck sabía cómo representar la elegancia indiferente y el tedio de una sociedad refinada.<br>
<br>
Fue un pintor barroco con un estilo reluciente, jugaba con una paleta clara y matizada, y reproducía las prendas más virtuosas: el terciopelo, el raso y la seda.<br>

Cubism (pageperfect Nook Book),"['Guillaume Apollinaire', 'Dorothea Eimert']","Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: five young women that changed modern art forever. Faces seen simultaneously from the front and in profile, angular bodies whose once voluptuous feminine forms disappear behind asymmetric lines - with this work, Picasso revolutionised the entire history of painting. Cubism was thus born in 1907. Transforming natural forms into cylinders and cubes, painters like Juan Gris and Robert Delaunay, led by Braque and Picasso, imposed a new vision upon the world that was in total opposition to the principles of the Impressionists. Largely diffused in Europe, Cubism developed rapidly in successive phases that brought art history to all the richness of the 20th century: from the futurism of Boccioni to the abstraction of Kandinsky, from the suprematism of Malevich to the constructivism of Tatlin.<br>
Linking the core text of Guillaume Apollinaire with the studies of Dr. Dorothea Eimert, this work offers a new interpretation of modernity's crucial moment, and permits the reader to rediscover, through their biographies, the principal representatives of the movement."
Angel City,['Mike Ripley'],"London in the early 1990s; supposedly the New Age ‘Caring Nineties’. But the streets, it turns out, are not paved with gold, but covered with the homeless living in leeping-bags and cardboard boxes, and often littered with a far more dangerous form of flotsam. For Angel, the city divides into several layers of underworlds and sub-cultures: callous crime and corruption, the growing drug culture, the seedier side of the gay scene, the young and homeless. There is also a more literal underworld where the role-playing game of Dungeons and Dragons can shift from fantasy to real violence at the flick of a wizard’s wand … But most serious of all is that Angel is down on his luck and flat broke. The situation is critical. So critical, he might even have to get a job..."

Andrea Mantegna And The Italian Renaissance (pageperfect Nook Book),['Joseph Manca'],"Mantegna was born in 1431. He trained in painting at the Padua School where Donatello and Paolo Uccello had previously attended. Even at a young age commissions for Andrea's work flooded in, for example the frescoes of the Ovetari Chapel of Padua.<br>
In a short space of time Mantegna found his niche as a modernist due to his highly original ideas; the use of perspective in his works. His marriage with Nicolosia Bellini, the sister of Giovanni, paved the way for his entree into Venice.<br>
Mantegna reached an artistic maturity with his altarpiece of Pala San Zeno. He remained in Mantua and became the artist for one of the most prestigious courts in Italy - the Court of Gonzague. Despite his links with Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, Mantegna refused to adopt their innovative use of colour or leave behind his own technique of engraving. The Bridal Suite is considered his most accomplished work."

Naive Art (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Naive art first became popular at the end of the 19th century. Until that time, this form of expression, created by untrained artists and characterised by spontaneity and simplicity, enjoyed little recognition from professional artists and art critics. Influenced by primitive arts, naive painting is distinguished by the fluidity of its lines, vivacity, and joyful colours, as well as by its rather clean-cut, simple shapes.<br>
Naive art counts among it artists: Henri Rousseau, Séraphine de Senlis, André Bauchant, and Camille Bombois. This movement has also found adherents abroad, including such prominent artists as Joan Miró, Guido Vedovato, Niko Pirosmani, and Ivan Generalic."

Claude Monet (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Para Monet, el acto de creación siempre fue una dolorosa lucha. Su obsesión por expresar emociones y transmitir el efecto de la luz sobre la naturaleza fue mucho más intensa que la de sus contemporáneos. En sus palabras: ""Las técnicas vienen y van... el arte siempre es el mismo: una transposición de la naturaleza que requiere tanto de la voluntad como de la sensibilidad. Me esfuerzo y forcejeo con el sol... debería pintar con oro y piedras preciosas""."
Paul Cézanne (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Paul Cézanne, Zeitgenosse der Impressionisten, durch die er am Anfang seines Schaffens beeinflusst wird, hat sich sehr schnell an seinen persönlichen Interessen orientiert, die aus ihm den aVater der modernen Malerei"" machten. Er hat Braque und Picasso wesentlich beeinflusst. Zu Lebzeiten wenig beachtet und von den Kritikern verachtet, setzt sich Cézanne mit einer neuen Sicht der Natur durch, die auf dem Studium der Farben und des Raumes basiert, welche er durch breite, fliesende Striche schafft. Dieses Buch präsentiert eine reiche Auswahl an Bildern des Künstlers, die er in verschiedenen Epochen gemalt hat. Sie ermöglichen es, die stilistische Entwicklung Cézannes genauso wie die Unterschiedlichkeit seiner Themen nachzuvollziehen: Landschaften wie Die Ufer der Marne oder Stillleben wie Früchte und Porträts wie Der Raucher sowie Selbstbildnisse.

Bonnard And The Nabis (pageperfect Nook Book),['Albert Kostenevitch'],"Pierre Bonnard was the leader of a group of post-impressionist painters who called themselves the Nabis, from the Hebrew word meaning 'prophet'. Bonnard, Vuillard, Roussel and Denis, the most distinguished of the Nabis, revolutionized the spirit of decorative techniques during one of the richest periods in the history of French painting. Influenced by Odilon Redon and Puvis de Chavanne, by popular imagery and Japanese etchings, this post-impressionist group was above all a close circle of friends who shared the same cultural background and interests. An increasing individualism in their art often threatened the group's unity and although tied together by a common philosophy their work clearly diverged. This publication lets us compare and put into perspective the artists within this fascinating group. The works presented in this collection offer a palette of extraordinary poetic expressions: candid in Bonnard, ornamental and mysterious in Vuillard, gently dream-like in Denis, grim and almost bitter in Vallotton, the author shares with us the lives of these artists to the very source of their creative gifts."

Geranium (botanical),['Kasia Boddy'],"They are sometimes called storksbills and originated in South Africa. They may be star-shaped or funnel-shaped, and they range in color from white, pink, and orange-red to fuchsia and deep purple. The geranium and its many species, much loved and also much loathed, have developed since the seventeenth century into one of the most popular garden plants. In this book, Kasia Boddy tells the story of geranium’s seemingly inexorable rise, unearthing the role it has played in everything from plant-hunting and commercial cultivation to alternative medicine, the philanthropic imagination, and changing styles in horticultural fashion.&nbsp;Boddy shows how geraniums became the latest fad for wealthy collectors and enterprising nurserymen after they were first collected by Dutch plant-hunters on the sandy flats near present-day Cape Town. She explains that the flower would not be rare for long—scarlet hybrids were soon found on every cottage windowsill and in every park bedding display, and the backlash against the innocent plant followed quickly on the heels of its ubiquity. Today, geraniums can be found throughout the world, grown as annuals in the regions too cold for them to regenerate. In addition to exploring the history of geraniums, Boddy reveals the plant’s other uses, including how they are cultivated and distilled for their scents of citrus, mint, pine, rose, and various spices to use in perfumes. With their edible leaves, they are also used to flavor desserts, cakes, jellies, and teas, and some people believe that certain species provide an effective treatment for a cough.&nbsp;Featuring over one hundred illustrations, <i>Geranium</i> shows how the plant is portrayed in painting, literature, film, and popular culture, and provides an intriguing example of the global industrialization of plant production."

The Story Of Lingerie (pageperfect Nook Book),"['Muriel Barbier', 'Shazia Boucher']","What is the social merit or purpose of all those bras and panties on perfectly sculpted bodies that we see spread across billboards and magazines? Many women indulge in lingerie to please men. Yet, ever since Antiquity, women have always kept lingerie hidden away under outer garments. Thus, lingerie must be more than erotic bait. Authors Muriel Barbier and Shazia Boucher have researched iconography to explore the relationship of lingerie to society, the economy and the corridors of intimacy. They correlate lingerie with emancipation, querying whether it asserts newfound freedoms or simply adjusts to conform to changing social values. The result is a rigorous scientific rationale spiced with a zest of humour. And the tinier lingerie gets, the more scholarly attention it deserves."

"Nuclear Dawn: The Atomic Bomb, From The Manhattan Project To The Cold War",['James Delgado'],"When President Obama and others say they want to end America's dependence on foreign oil, the vision is usually presented in terms of ""a new Manhattan Project."" So what really was the Manhattan Project? According to James Delgado, at the start of the project in 1942, the element plutonium only existed in microscopic quantities. By June 16, 1945, the date of the world's first nuclear bomb test, America had a fully-operational plutonium industry capable of producing hundreds of pounds of the fissionable material. In just three short years, nuclear weapon technology had progressed from infancy to the world stage. <br>
<br>
Delgado, the co-host of the National Geographic Television series ""The Sea Hunters,"" tells the breathtaking story of the original Manhattan Project and its aftermath. While most previous authors have focused on either the scientific or the social history of the events, Delgado's is the first to spotlight the military and political phases of the atom bomb. In crisp prose, he covers the background of the bomb in the labs in Europe, Britain, and America, but the story picks up speed after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war by America.<br>
<br>
While most people recognize Robert Oppenheimer as the father of the bomb, readers of <i>Nuclear Dawn</i> will be surprised to learn that gave birth more in the sense that Henry Ford gave birth to the auto industry. In Delgado's narrative, Oppenheimer's role as master organizer and astute business manager is emphasized. What's more, few before Delgado have understood how deeply involved the US Army was in the project. From the very beginning, the program was run by army officers, financed by secret wartime military funds--to the tune of billions of dollars, staffed by army engineers and scientists, and made possible by army bureaucracy. Delgado also shows that without the army's ordnance expertise at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer's team could not have turned nuclear technology into a workable bomb.<br>
<br>
Several other unique aspects of <i>Nuclear Dawn</i> turn on the military's role in the project. For example, Delgado tells the full story of the army air force's 509th fighter battalion, which was headed by an iconoclastic colonel named Paul Tibbets. Tibbets' battalion consisted of over 1,200 pilots and crew dedicated to a singular task: delivering an atomic bomb to Japan. Delgado tells how as part of their training, the Utah-based crews would fly practice sorties to Cuba and back, over and over again. <br>
<br>
Another little-known aspect of the Manhattan Project drawn out be Delgado is the post-war bickering that quickly arose between the army and navy over who would control the bomb. James Delgado's new book fills a very important gap in our understanding of the enormous changes that the United States military underwent during WWII.

Magical Paths: Labyrinths & Mazes In The 21st Century,['Jeff Saward'],"Wind your way through a maze or a labyrinth: two symbolic journeys, both rooted in myth and mystery.

Jasper Johns (pageperfect Nook Book),['Catherine Craft'],"Zu einer Zeit, als der abstrakte Expressionismus die amerikanische Malkunst beherrscht und die Betonung auf kühnen Farben, einem fast brutalen malerischen Duktus und zumeist abstrakten Kompositionen liegt, beschreitet Jasper Johns mit seinen amerikanischen Flaggen, Schiesscheiben, Zahlen und Buchstaben ganz eigene Wege. Obwohl - oder weil - er seine Bilder offensichtlich mit groser Sorgfalt und Präzision malt, wirken sie zurückhaltend, kühl und ruhig, ja, distanziert und jedenfalls weit entfernt von den emotionalen Feuerwerken vieler seiner berühmten Zeitgenossen.<br>
aEs begann damit, dass ich ein Bild der amerikanischen Fahne malte. Durch die Verwendung dieses Designs sparte ich mir Arbeit, ich musste nichts Eigenes entwerfen. Also nahm ich mir weitere ähnliche Dinge vor, etwa Schiesscheiben, bestehende Dinge, die wir alle kennen. Dies gab mir den Raum, auf anderen Ebenen zu arbeiten. Zum Beispiel war für mich die Malerei immer eine Fläche; beim Malen in einer einzigen Farbe wurde dies besonders deutlich. Ich gelangte auch zu der Meinung, dass ein Bild von seinem Betrachter keinen speziellen Fokus verlangen sollte, anders als etwa ein Gang zur Kirche. Ein Bild sollte man anschauen wie einen Heizkörper"".<br>
Im Gegensatz zu den Statements der meisten anderen Künstler im New York der 1950er Jahre waren Johns' Bemerkungen stets frei von modischen Begriffen wie Angst und Zweifel. Er schien seine Sujets bewusst und gezielt im Rahmen einer visuellen und intellektuellen Aktivität auszuwählen, losgelöst von persönlichen Gefühlen und idealistischen Vorurteilen oder Erwartungen. Jüngere Künstler empfanden seine Werke nicht so sehr als kalt und gefühllos, sondern eher als ehrlich und klarsichtig, besonders im Vergleich zu den übersteigerten Ausdrucksformen des abstrakten Expressionismus.<br>
Durch seine Darstellung von allgemein bekannten Gegenständen schien Johns die damals vorherrschende abstrakte Malerei von sich zu weisen. Gleichzeitig besitzen seine Motive, die Flaggen, Zahlen, Zielscheiben, jedoch ein entscheidendes Merkmal der klassischen Abstraktion, nämlich eine Flächigkeit, die sie sozusagen mit der Bildebene eins werden lässt.<br>
Die Autorin zeigt, wie es Jasper Johns mit seinem Werk gelingt, die Polarität zwischen Abstraktion und Repräsentation, die über Jahrzehnte die Debatte um die moderne Kunst beherrscht hatte, aufzuheben. Mit einem Mal war es nun möglich, die Beziehung der Kunst zur Welt in einem ganz neuen Licht zu sehen. Sie befasst sich auch mit der Frage, wie es kommt, dass Johns im Alter von nur 27 Jahren mit seiner ersten Ausstellung in der Leo Castelli Galerie mit einem Schlag zu einem der bekanntesten Künstler der zeitgenössischen Kunstszene wurde und diese Stellung bis heute beibehalten hat.<br>"

Born Amish,"['Ruth Irene Garrett', 'Deborah Morse-kahn']","""But what was your life like before?"" 
<p>This is the question that RUTH IRENE GARRETT, nee Miller, has been asked again and again by the thousands of inspired and fascinated guests who have attended her lectures and programs on her life growing up Amish to young womanhood, when she fell in love with an ""Englisher"" and left the Amish community to begin her new life out in the world.</p>
<p>Now, working with co-author and friend DEBORAH MORSE-KAHN, we learn about Ruth Irene Garrett's early life as a child growing up in the Amish farming community of Kalona, Iowa: school, games, and chores; work, crafts, and foods; clothing, farming and tumbling about with many brothers and sisters. We learn about the expectations for girls and boys in Amish families, of social roles and understandings about courtship and marriage, about adult baptism and a life of faith in the Amish Church.</p>
<p> <i>Born Amish</i> is richly illustrated with wonderful color photographs of young people and families in Amish life throughout the American Midwest.</p>"

The Gnostic Bible: The Pistis Sophia Unveiled,['Samael Aun Weor'],"""It came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and instructing them..."" (The Pistis Sophia) 
<p>The Apostles wrote down what Jesus taught them during those eleven years, resulting in ""The Pistis Sophia,"" the most important Gnostic scripture. Includes an extensive commentary by Samael Aun Weor. ""The Pistis Sophia"" is a sophisticated and deeply mystical teaching given by Jesus about the suffering of Sophia as she attempts to ascend to the highest spiritual truth. This scripture is remarkable for its profound mysticism, its clear rebuke of unethical behavior, and its perspective on the spiritual role of women. Having read this text, it becomes very clear why the established religious powers attempted to obliterate the Gnostics, but failed. Study of this teaching also inspires a re-evaluation of how the Christian Gospels have been interpreted for centuries.</p>
<p>About this scripture, the commentary author Samael Aun Weor said, """"The Hebrew Bible clearly connotes the Word of the Eternal One. However, we, the Gnostics, also have our very special Bible. I want to emphatically declare that this is The Pistis Sophia, whose original is in Coptic. It was found underground in Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs. The Pistis Sophia contains all the words of the adorable Savior of the world. It was written by the Apostles. Thus, all the Esoteric-Christic instructions that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples on the Mount of the Olives and other holy places is written within this book. This book had been conserved in secret for many centuries. In this book, the Adorable One left an extraordinary, formidable body of doctrine.""</p>"

The Lighthouse,"['Moore, Alison , 1971-']","<i>The Lighthouse</i> begins on a North Sea ferry, on whose blustery outer deck stands Futh, a middle-aged, recently separated man heading to Germany for a restorative walking holiday.
<p>Spending his first night in Hellhaus at a small, family-run hotel, he finds the landlady hospitable but is troubled by an encounter with an inexplicably hostile barman.</p>
<p>In the morning, Futh puts the episode behind him and sets out on his week-long circular walk along the Rhine. As he travels, he contemplates his childhood; a complicated friendship with the son of a lonely neighbour; his parents' broken marriage and his own. But the story he keeps coming back to, the person and the event affecting all others, is his mother and her abandonment of him as a boy, which left him with a void to fill, a substitute to find.</p>
<p>He recalls his first trip to Germany with his newly single father. He is mindful of something he neglected to do there, an omission which threatens to have devastating repercussions for him this time around.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Futh, sunburnt and blistered, comes to the end of his circular walk, returning to what he sees as the sanctuary of the Hellhaus hotel, unaware of the events which have been unfolding there in his absence.</p>

An Accidental Athlete: A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Middle Age,['John The Penguin Bingham'],"<p class=""null1"">A funny thing happened on my way to middle age. I became an athlete. And not just any athlete, but a runner—all without taking a running step until I was 43 years old.</p>
<p>Known by fans as ""The Penguin"" for his back-of-the-pack speed, John Bingham is the unlikely hero of the modern running boom. In this warm, witty memoir, the best-selling author and columnist recalls his childhood dreams of athletic glory, sedentary years of unhealthy excess, and a life-changing transformation from couch potato to ""adult-onset athlete.""</p>

How They See Us: Meditations On America,['Nadir Atlas'],"<p class=""null1"">Americans live in a pre-Copernican universe: we think the world revolves around us. Seventeen writers from abroad offer a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>A superpower without parallel since the British Empire, the United States is a source of incessant fascination to the rest of the world.

You Let Some Girl Beat You?: The Story Of Ann Meyers Drysdale,['Ann Meyers Drysdale'],"<p>""Annie was one of the best players ever. I didn't say male or female; I said ever.""—Bill Russell, former Boston Celtics player</p>
<p>Ann Meyers Drysdale is one of the greatest stars in the history of basketball. But her rise wasn't without controversy. Her 1979 NBA bid to play with the Indiana Pacers brought a barrage of criticism. But Ann simply wanted to play among the best. She had always competed with the guys, and she never let anyone keep her down. In <i>You Let Some Girl Beat You?</i> she shares her inspirational story for the first time.</p>
<p>A female first in many categories, Meyers Drysdale was the first woman ever signed to a four-year athletic scholarship to UCLA, where she remains the only four-time Bruin basketball All American, male or female. Ann was also the only woman ever asked to compete in ABC Sports' <i>Superstars</i>, pitting her against elite athletes like Mark Spitz, Joe Frazier, O.J. Simpson, and Mark Gastineau.</p>
<p>After her athletic career <b>Ann Meyers Drysdale</b> went on to do color commentary on all the national stations. She also married Don Drysdale, legendary pitcher and announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, making them the first ever married couple enshrined in their respective sport's Hall of Fame. Today Ann continues to break through barriers. She is the only female vice president in the NBA (she is vice president of the Phoenix Suns), and is also the general manager of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, which has won two WNBA championships since she took over four years ago. <i>The New York Times</i> featured her prominently in a piece in August 2011 called ""Pioneers Continue to Shepherd Women's Basketball."" <i>Time</i> magazine recently named her one of the ten greatest female athletes of all time.</p>"

Peak Performance: The First Welsh Woman To Climb Everest,['Tori James'],"<p>&nbsp;‘You fall you’re dead,’ the voice inside my head told me.

The Pathseeker (the Contemporary Art Of The Novella),['Imre Kertesz'],"<p><b>""There's no such thing as chance...only injustice.""</b></p>
<p>From the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for “writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history...""</p>
<p>The acclaimed Hungarian Holocaust survivor Imre Kertész continues his investigation of the malignant methodologies of totalitarianism in a major work of fiction.</p>
<p>In a mysterious middle–European country, a man identified only as “the commissioner” undertakes what seems to be a banal trip to a nondescript town with his wife—a brief detour on the way to a holiday at the seaside—that turns into something ominous. Something terrible has happened in the town, something that no one wants to discuss. With his wife watching on fearfully, he commences a perverse investigation, rudely interrogating the locals, inspecting a local landmark with a frightening intensity, traveling to an outlying factory where he confronts the proprietors ... and slowly revealing a past he's been trying to suppress.</p>
<p>In a limpid translation by Tim Wilkinson, this haunting tale lays bare an emotional and psychological landscape ravaged by totalitarianism in one of Kertsz's most devastating examinations of the responsibilities of and for the Holocaust.</p>
<p><b>The Contemporary Art of the Novella</b> series is designed to highlight work by major authors from around the world. In most instances, as with Imre Kertész, it showcases work never before published; in others, books are reprised that should never have gone out of print. It is intended that the series feature many well-known authors and some exciting new discoveries. And as with the original series, The Art of the Novella, each book is a beautifully packaged and inexpensive volume meant to celebrate the form and its practitioners.</p>"

Circle Of Six: The True Story Of New York's Most Notorious Cop Killer And The Cop Who Risked Everything To Catch Him,"['Jurgensen', 'Randy']","<p><i>Circle of Six</i> is the true story of what is perhaps the most notorious case in the history of the New York Police Department. It details Randy Jurgensen's determined effort to bring to justice the murderer of Patrolman Phillip Cardillo, who was shot and killed inside Harlem's Mosque #7 in 1972, in the midst of an all-out assault on the NYPD from the Black Liberation Army. The New York of this era was a place not unlike the Wild West, in which cops and criminals shot it out on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Despite the mayhem on the streets and the Machiavellian corridors of Mayor Lindsay's City Hall, Detective Jurgensen single-handedly took on the Black Liberation Army, the Nation of Islam, NYPD brass, and City Hall, capturing Cardillo's killer, Lewis 17X Dupree. He broke the case with an unlikely accomplice, Foster 2X Thomas, a member of the Nation of Islam who became Jurgensen's witness. The relationship they formed during the time before trial gave each of the two men a greater perspective of the two sides in the street war and changed them forever. In the end, Jurgensen had to settle for a conviction on other charges, and Dupree served a number of years. The murder case is still officially unsolved. In 2006 the NYPD re-opened the case, and it is once again an active investigation with full media attention.</p>
<p>The book has received acclaim from current New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, as well as former Commissioner William Bratton.</p>"
Freeman,['Leonard Jr. Pitts'],"<p><i>Freeman</i>, the new novel by Leonard Pitts, Jr., takes place in the first few months following the Confederate surrender and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Upon learning of Lee's surrender, Sam—a runaway slave who once worked for the Union Army—decides to leave his safe haven in Philadelphia and set out on foot to return to the war-torn South. What compels him on this almost-suicidal course is the desire to find his wife, the mother of his only child, whom he and their son left behind 15 years earlier on the Mississippi farm to which they all ""belonged.""</p>
<p>At the same time, Sam's wife, Tilda, is being forced to walk at gunpoint with her owner and two of his other slaves from the charred remains of his Mississippi farm into Arkansas, in search of an undefined place that would still respect his entitlements as slaveowner and Confederate officer.</p>
<p>The book's third main character, Prudence, is a fearless, headstrong white woman of means who leaves her Boston home for Buford, Mississippi, to start a school for the former bondsmen, and thus honor her father’s dying wish.</p>
<p>At bottom, <i>Freeman</i> is a love story—sweeping, generous, brutal, compassionate, patient—about the feelings people were determined to honor, despite the enormous constraints of the times. It is this aspect of the book that should ensure it a strong, vocal, core audience of African-American women, who will help propel its likely critical acclaim to a wider audience. At the same time, this book addresses several themes that are still hotly debated today, some 145 years after the official end of the Civil War. Like <i>Cold Mountain</i>, <i>Freeman</i> illuminates the times and places it describes from a fresh perspective, with stunning results. It has the potential to become a classic addition to the literature dealing with this period. Few other novels so powerfully capture the pathos and possibility of the era particularly as it reflects the ordeal of the black slaves grappling with the promise—and the terror—of their new status as free men and women.</p>"

Sartre For Beginners,['Donald D. Palmer'],"<p><i>Sartre For Beginners</i> is an accessible, yet sophisticated introduction to the life and works of the famous French philosopher, Jean Paul Sartre. Sartre was a member the French underground during World War II, a novelist, a playwright, and a major influence in French political and intellectual life. The book opens with a biographical section, introducing the significant events in the life of the man who coined the term, “Existentialism.” Then it examines Sartre’s early philosophical works. Ideas from Sartre’s other fictional and dramatic works are discussed, but the greatest part of the book is the presentation of the main concepts from Sartre’s <i>Being and Nothingness</i> (1943). These ideas include the topics of consciousness, freedom, responsibility, absurdity, “bad faith”, authenticity and the hellish confrontation with other people. Finally, the book deals with Sartre’s modification of his earlier existentialism to compliment his conversion to a kind of “existential” Marxism. <i>Sartre For Beginners</i> summarizes the work of the most renowned philosopher of the 20th century.</p>"

Taj Mahal: A Story Of Love And Empire (wonders Of The World Book),"['Elizabeth Mann', 'Alan Witschonke']","<p><i>The Magnificent Mughals of India.</i></p>
<p>Shah Jahan, ruler of India, murdered three of his brothers in his bloody rise to power. Yet when his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, suddenly died, the grief-stricken emperor built the world's most beautiful tomb as a monument to her memory.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth emperor of the Mughal dynasty. The Mughals combined the brute force and fierce ambition of their legendary ancestor Genghis Khan with a delicate artistic sensitivity. Theirs was a world where even forts were architectural gems, where emperors had their life stories told in exquisite miniature paintings, and where each new ruler competed with the previous one by building a grander palace, fort, mosque and city.</p>
<p>The <b>Taj Mahal</b> tells the story of this remarkable dynasty through its greatest artistic achievement.

A new generation of artists--as well as some who never abandoned figurative painting in the first place--is relishing the solitary, slow, subtle set of processes involved in not just painting, but painting people.

In this brightly colored book, the alphabet is presented in both Spanish and English, and includes the four additional letters—and whimsical animals—that make the Spanish alphabet so much fun.</p>

<p><i>Entangled</i> rides a growing wave of interest in parallel dimensions and imaginary worlds (<i>The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>The Golden Compass</i> are recent Hollywood examples) and will have immediate appeal to readers of Philip Pullman, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Kate Mosse, among others.</p>
<p>But <i>Entangled</i> has the added merit of being grounded in solid anthropological and scientific research. Hancock calls on his years of research into cutting-edge issues, including the ""Neanderthal Enigma,"" the nature of consciousness, the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, parallel realms, time travel, and near-death and out-of-body experiences.</p>"

"Recent History Of United States In Political Cartoons: A Look Bok (law, Politics, And Society)",['Chip Bok'],"<p>History books are often sprinkled with editorial cartoons to illuminate the issues of a period of time.

It begins in Vietnam and the waning years of the Nixon administration, the launching point of a thousand cartoon careers, and ends in the current war in Iraq. This book looks at many issues, (the economy, military spending, race relations, religion, and culture) which have remained issues over the last 25 years and seven presidents, they simply increase and decrease over time. One of the lessons drawn from this effort is that nothing ever gets resolved. All the big questions keep coming back in one form or another, making for interesting reading.</p>"

The Meat Free Monday Cookbook: A Full Menu For Every Monday Of The Year,['Meat Free Monday Campaign'],"<p>In 2009, Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney launched the Meat Free Monday campaign as a simple and straightforward idea to show everyone the value of eating less meat – and to make it easier for us to do so. Cutting down the amount of meat in our diet has a huge range of environmental and personal benefits, including significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with livestock production, boosting our health by increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables in our diet, and helping us save money by offering substitutes for expensive meat and fish. Often, though, our vegetarian repertoire is limited, with the result that our enthusiasm to continue with a meat-free day wanes when we are confronted with yet again eating the same dish. With menus for each of the 52 weeks of the year – two main recipes, plus four other ideas for each meal of the day – The Meat Free Monday Cookbook addresses this problem and is aimed at everyone who cares about the environment, is happy to eat vegetarian one day a week, but needs inspiration and guidance to do so. Packed with vibrant spring soups, inventive summer salads, appetizing fall casseroles and comforting winter stews, the recipes include such enticing dishes as Grilled Figs with Ricotta, Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes, Sicilian Cauliflower Pasta, Mexican Cornbread, Pilau Rice with Cashews, French Bean, Roquefort and Walnut Salad, Watermelon Granita, Hot Mozzarella Sandwich, Roasted Halloumi Wrap and Onion and Walnut Muffins, and cover everything from alternatives to the ubiquitous ham sandwich in your packed lunch and the traditional cooked breakfast to satisfying snacks for when hunger strikes. With contributions from Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney, as well as celebrity and chef supporters of the campaign such as Skye Gyngell, Giorgio Locatelli, Yotam Ottellenghi, Tom Aikens, Kevin Spacey, Pink, Twiggy, Woody Harrelson, Vivienne Westwood and Pamela Anderson, The Meat Free Monday Cookbook is guaranteed to tempt even the most confirmed carnivore. The Meat Free Monday campaign was launched by Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney in 2009 and its message is One Day a Week Can Make a World of Difference. The campaign aims to encourage everyone to do their bit to help protect our planet by demonstrating that by giving up meat for one day each week you can save money, reduce your environmental impact and live a healthier life.</p>"

Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self,['Robert Waggoner'],"<p>Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self is the account of an extraordinarily talented lucid dreamer who goes beyond the boundaries of both psychology and religion. In the process, he stumbles upon the Inner Self. While lucid (consciously aware) in the dream state and able to act and interact with dream figures, objects, and settings, dream expert Robert Waggoner experienced something transformative and unexpected. He was able to interact consciously with the dream observer - the apparent Inner Self - within the dream. At first this seemed shocking, even impossible, since psychology normally alludes to such theoretical inner aspects as the Subliminal Self, the Center, the Internal Self-Helper in vague and theoretical ways. Waggoner came to realize, however, that aware interaction with the Inner Self was not only possible, but actual and highly inspiring. He concluded that while aware in the dream state, one has both a psychological tool and a platform from which to understand dreaming and the larger picture of man's psyche as well. Waggoner proposes 5 stages of lucid dreaming and guides readers through them, offering advice for those who have never experienced the lucid dream state and suggestions for how experienced lucid dreamers can advance to a new level. Lucid Dreaming offers exciting insights and vivid illustrations that will intrigue not only avid dreamworkers but anyone who is interested in consciousness, identity, and the definition of reality.<br></p>"

"Buddha, Vol. 8: Jetavana",['Osamu Tezuka'],"<p>Osamu Tezuka’s vaunted storytelling genius, consummate skill at visual expression, and warm humanity blossom fully in his eight-volume epic of Siddhartha’s life and times. Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha’s ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka’s Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one’s life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers’ attention.</p>
<p>Tezuka himself was a humanist rather than a Buddhist, and his magnum opus is not an attempt at propaganda. Hermann Hesse’s novel or Bertolucci’s film is comparable in this regard; in fact, Tezuka’s approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humor.</p>"

Baksheesh (a Kati Hirschel Istanbul Mystery),['Esmahan Aykol'],"<p>Praise for the first Kati Hirschel Istanbul mystery:</p>
<p>""The heroine is an offbeat amateur sleuth with a distinctive narrative voice. Fans of such female detectives as Amanda Cross's Kate Fansler and Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fisher will find a lot to like.""—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>
<p>Kati Hirschel, the owner of Istanbul's only mystery bookstore, is fed up. It all started when her lover Selim insisted that she behave like the Turkish wife of a respectable lawyer. Looking demure and making witty small talk were the only requirements. Then her landlord announced an outrageous rent increase on her Istanbul apartment.</p>
<p>She has no desire to move in with Selim. She'd rather learn the art of bribing government officials in order to find a new place. Kati is offered a large apartment with a view over the Bosphorus at a bargain price. Too good to be true until a man is found murdered there and she becomes the police's prime suspect. In her second novel Esmahan Aykol takes us to the alleys and boulevards of cosmopolitan Istanbul, to posh villas and seedy basement flats, to the property agents and lawyers, to Islamist leaders and city officials—in fact everywhere that baksheesh helps move things along.</p>
<p><b>Esmahan Aykol</b> was born in 1970 in Edirne, Turkey. She lives in Istanbul and Berlin. She has written three Kati Hirschel novels. <i>Baksheesh</i> is the second and has been published in Turkish, German, French, and Italian.

Located only 150 miles north of a major city, the range is home to beautiful alpine gardens, stunning vistas, and a carefully maintained network of hiking trails.

It is a recipe for challenge, adventure - and tragedy. Not Without Peril offers extensive and intimate profiles of twenty-two climbers who found trouble on the Presidential Range from 1849 to 1994. Summer snowstorms, raging rivers, impenetrable fog banks, and a single misplaced step are all part of the dangers awaiting even the most careful hiker. Veteran journalist Nicholas Howe sifted through crumbling archives, interviewed dozens of participants, and hiked the mountains to retrace each fateful journey. The result is a compelling story of our changing relationship with the mountains we love and the risks they pose. (6 x 9, 320 pages, maps, b&amp;w photos)</p>"
"A Day In The Life Of Ancient Rome: Daily Life, Mysteries, And Curiosities",['Alberto Angela'],"<p>The roar of frenzied spectators inside the Coliseum during a battle between gladiators. A crowd of onlookers gathered around a slave driver. The wondrous plenty of banquets where flamingos are roasted whole and wine flows like rivers. The silence of the baths and the boisterous taverns . . . Many books have dealt with the history of ancient Rome, but none has been able to bring its readers so near to daily life in the Imperial capital.</p>
<p>This extraordinary voyage of exploration, guided by Alberto Angela with the charm of a born story- teller, lasts twenty- four hours, beginning at dawn on an ordinary day in the year 115 A.D., with Imperial Rome at the height of its power. The reader wakes in a rich patrician home and discovers frescoes, opulent furnishings and richly appointed boudoirs. Strolling though the splendors of the Roman Forum, one overhears both erudite opinions from learned orators and local ribaldry floating out from the public latrines. One meets the intense gazes of Roman matriarchs strolling the streets, looks on as a banquet is prepared, and is afforded a peek into the sexual habits and fetishes of Roman patricians and plebs. For all those who have ever dreamed of traveling back in time, Alberto Angela's narrative style will come as a welcome change to dry historical tomes. Rich in atmosphere and historical information, <i>A Day in Ancient Rome</i> is a voyage into a world both distant to us in time and surprisingly near in its habits, mores, and passions.</p>"

"Madness, Rack, And Honey: Collected Lectures","['Ruefle, Mary , 1952-']","<p>This is one of the wisest books I've read in years... -<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p>
<p>No writer I know of comes close to even trying to articulate the weird magic of poetry as Ruefle does. She acknowledges and celebrates in the odd mystery and mysticism of the act—the fact that poetry must both guard and reveal, hint at and pull back... Also, and maybe most crucially, Ruefle’s work is never once stuffy or overdone: she writes this stuff with a level of seriousness-as-play that’s vital and welcome, that doesn’t make writing poetry sound anything but wild, strange, life-enlargening fun. -<i>The Kenyon Review</i></p>
<p>Profound, unpredictable, charming, and outright funny...These informal talks have far more staying power and verve than most of their kind. Readers may come away dazzled, as well as amused... -<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>
<p>This is a book not just for poets but for anyone interested in the human heart, the inner-life, the breath exhaling a completion of an idea that will make you feel changed in some way. This is a desert island book. -<i>Matthew Dickman</i></p>
<p>The accomplished poet is humorous and self-deprecating in this collection of illuminating essays on poetry, aesthetics and literature... -<i>San Francisco Examiner</i></p>
<p>Over the course of fifteen years, Mary Ruefle delivered a lecture every six months to a group of poetry graduate students. Collected here for the first time, these lectures include ""Poetry and the Moon,"" ""Someone Reading A Book Is A Sign Of Order In The World,"" and ""Lectures I Will Never Give."" Intellectually virtuosic, instructive, and experiential, <i>Madness, Rack, and Honey</i> resists definition, demanding instead an utter—and utterly pleasurable—immersion.</p>
<p><b>Mary Ruefle</b> has published more than a dozen books of poetry, prose, and erasures. She lives in Vermont.</p>"

Steinbeck Novels 1942-1952: The Moon Is Down / Cannery Row / The Pearl / East Of Eden (library Of America),['John Steinbeck'],"<p>This third volume in The Library of America's authoritative edition of <b>John Steinbeck</b>'s writings shows one of America's most enduring popular writers continuing restlessly to explore new subject matter and new approaches to storytelling.</p>
<p><b>The Moon Is Down</b> (1942), set in an unnamed Scandinavian country under German occupation, dramatizes the transformation of ordinary life under totalitarian rule and the underground struggle against the Nazi invaders. In <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945) Steinbeck paid tribute to his closest friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, in the central character of Doc, proprietor of the Western Biological Laboratory and spiritual and financial mainstay of a cast of philosophical drifters and hangers-on. The comic and bawdy evocation of the main street of Monterey's sardine-canning district has made this one of the most popular of all Steinbeck's novels. Steinbeck's long involvement with Mexican culture is distilled in <b>The Pearl</b> (1947). Expanding on an anecdote he had heard about a boy who found a pearl of unusual size, Steinbeck turned it into an allegory of the corrupting influence of sudden wealth. <b>The Pearl</b> appears here with the original illustrations by José Clemente Orozco.</p>
<p>Ambitious in scale and original in structure, <b>East of Eden</b> (1952) recounts the violent and emotionally turbulent history of a Salinas Valley family through several generations. Drawing on Biblical parallels, <b>East of Eden</b> is an epic that explores the writer's deepest and most anguished concerns within a landscape that for him had mythic resonance.</p>"
Teun Hocks,['Teun Hocks'],"<p>Though Dutch artist Teun Hocks-performer, photographer, painter-is widely known and shown around the world, this will be his first English-language book. In it, Hocks plays his signature role, which Janet Koplos describes as an innocent Everyman in an always strange and often funny world, in scenes that range from burlesque to tragicomic. His lonely Buster Keaton-like persona perseveres through odd and unforgiving environments, struggling to find stable ground in an unstable, even absurd, universe. Life's complications and challenges take the form of impossible Rube Goldbergian contraptions fraught with psychological implications. Each engaging image captures one moment of an implied narrative, triggering questions about how the protagonist ever got himself into such a fix and what in the world will happen next. Hocks begins by sketching out various one-man narratives, and then poses himself in a carefully plotted setup against his own painted backdrop. After photographing the scene, he paints in oil on top of the resulting oversize gelatin silver print. In addition to his painted photographs,<i>Teun Hocks</i> includes drawings, Polaroids and studio shots that illuminate the artist's creative process. The wit, elaborate technique and rich colors of Hocks's images combine to form an irrepressibly original oeuvre.</p>"

"Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, And Suffering Behind The Symbol Of Perfection",['Deirdre Kelly'],"<p>Throughout her history, the ballerina has been perceived as the embodiment of beauty and perfection— the feminine ideal. But the reality is another story. From the earliest ballerinas in the 17th century, who often led double lives as concubines, through the poverty of the corps de ballet dancers in the 1800’s and the anorexic and bulimic ballerinas of George Balanchine, starvation and exploitation have plagued ballerinas throughout history.</p>
<p>Using the stories of great dancers such as Anna Pavlova, Isadora Duncan, Suzanne Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, and Evelyn Hart, Deirdre Kelly exposes the true rigors for women in ballet. She rounds her critique with examples of how the world of ballet is slowly evolving for the better. But to ensure that this most graceful of dance forms survives into the future, she says that the time has come to rethink ballet, to position the ballerina at its center and accord her the respect she deserves.</p>"

Gender & Sexuality For Beginners,['Jaimee Garbacik'],"<p>We should not need to prove our experiences, defend our realities, or negotiate basic human rights. But we do.</p>
<p>What does sexual orientation mean if the very categories of gender are in question? How do we measure equality when our society's definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" leave out much of the population? There is no consensus on what a ""real"" man or woman is, where one's sex begins and ends, or what purpose the categories of masculine and feminine traits serve. While significant strides have been made in recent years on behalf of women's, gay and lesbian rights, there is still a large division between the law and day-to-day reality for LGBTQIA and female-identified individuals in American society. The practices, media outlets and institutions that privilege heterosexuality and traditional gender roles as ""natural"" need a closer examination.</p>
<p>Gender and Sexuality For Beginners considers the uses and limitations of biology in defining gender. Questioning gender and sex as both categories and forms of compulsory identification, it critically examines the issues in the historical and contemporary construction, meaning and perpetuation of gender roles. Gender and Sexuality For Beginners interweaves neurobiology, psychology, feminist, queer and trans theory, as well as historical gay and lesbian activism to offer new perspectives on gender inequality, ultimately pointing to the clear inadequacy of gender categories and the ways in which the sex-gender system oppresses us all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gender and Sexuality For Beginners examines the evolution of gender roles and definitions of sexual orientation in American society, illuminating how neither is as objective or ""natural"" as we are often led to believe.</p>"
Welcome to Hell: Three and a Half Months of Marine Corps Boot Camp,['Patrick Turley'],"<p>Welcome to Hell, the drill instructor announced to the small crowd of young men staring at him apprehensively, his words charging the atmosphere with a foreboding intensity. Three and one half months of hellish and seemingly outrageous demands would be made of those who would endure the journey through the fires of boot camp. These young men would find a pride in themselves that would last forever. Those survivors of boot camp training often look back, with a smile and even a laugh, at what they endured from the DI. Patrick Turley, driven to enlist by the events of 9/11, captures these anxious times perfectly in vivid detail establishing an emotional bond with the reader throughout his journey from man to Marine, and John Patrick Shanley said it only as a former Marine and Pulitzer Prize winner could: It's great to have gone to Marine Corps boot camp.

1968; The Year That Saved Ohio State Football,['David Hyde'],"1968 begins in the mens' room of an exclusive Columbus restaurant and ends two years later in The Rose Bowl, an unwitting but flawless metaphor for Ohio State University's rise to the pinnacle of college football. Between these two events occurs one of the great adventure stories in the history of the sport. Against a backdrop of national turmoil and international crises, Coach Wayne Woodrow Hayes uncharacteristically brings into his lagging program new young coaches and an impressive bunch of extraordinary kids, including the first significant number of African-Americans. There is an irreverent military school lineman who begins the school's lifting program by bringing his own weights, a Brooklyn fullback who can't believe Ohio's open spaces, a running back with New Jersey street-gang cred, and a homegrown quarterback with a bad back and an unassailable talent. All of them labor under the shadow of Hayes, the promethean figure who would leave an indelible legacy as one of the century's great coaches--sly, mercurial, pugnacious, maddeningly contradictory, a larger-than-life figure who carries the football ambitions of an entire state on his beefy shoulders. 1968 is a rich tapestry of scenes and stories throughout an incandescent season, including some of the best football dialogue ever written. In scene after scene, the raw intensity of an unforgettable season pulls the reader along to its breathless climax in Pasadena when the Super Sophs take on one of college's greatest running backs. It's a story that has everything--great drama, achievement, colorful characters, and the complex unfolding of Woody Hayes's multifaceted personality. Near the end of a chaotic decade, the Buckeyesprovide a badly needed feel-good lift to an entire state. And just as Woody predicted, they found themselves a large, inextricably bound family, tied forever by the commonalities of blood--literally theirs--sweat, tears, laughter, and, of course, their near-miraculous season."

Democracy in America,"['Tocqueville, Alexis De , 1805-1859']","Alexis de Tocqueville, a young aristocratic French lawyer, came to the United States in 1831 to study its penitentiary systems. His nine-month visit and subsequent reading and reflection resulted in <i>Democracy in America</i> (1835—40), a landmark masterpiece of political observation and analysis. Tocqueville vividly describes the unprecedented social equality he found in America and explores its implications for European society in the emerging modern era. His book provides enduring insight into the political consequences of widespread property ownership, the potential dangers to liberty inherent in majority rule, the importance of civil institutions in an individualistic culture dominated by the pursuit of material self-interest, and the vital role of religion in American life, while prophetically probing the deep differences between the free and slave states. The clear, fluid, and vigorous translation by Arthur Goldhammer is the first to fully capture Tocqueville's achievements both as an accomplished literary stylist and as a profound political thinker."
"Dada: Zurich, Berlin, Hannover, Cologne, New York, Paris","['Dickerman, Leah , 1964-']","Along with Russian constructivism and surrealism, Dada stands as one of the three most significant movements of the historical avant-garde. Born in the heart of Europe in the midst of World War I, Dada displayed a raucous skepticism about accepted values. Its embrace of new materials, of collage and assemblage techniques, of the designation of manufactured objects as art objects as well as its interest in performance, sound poetry, and manifestos fundamentally shaped the terms of modern art practice and created an abiding legacy for postwar art. Yet, while the word Dada has common currency, few know much about Dada art itself. In contrast to other key avant-garde movements, there has never been a major American exhibition that explores Dada specifically in broad view. <i>Dada</i>—the catalogue to the exhibition on view in 2006 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and The Museum of Modern Art in New York presents the hybrid forms of Dada art through an examination of city centers where Dada emerged: Zurich, Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, New York, and Paris. Covered here are works by some 40 artists made in the period from circa 1916, when the Cabaret Voltaire was founded in Zurich, to 1926, by which time most of the Dada groups had dispersed or significantly transformed. The city sections bring together painting, sculpture, photography, collage, photomontage, prints and graphic work. <br>
 <br>
Relying on dynamic design and vivid documentary images, <i>Dada</i> takes us through these six cities via topical essays and extensive plate sections; an illustrated chronology of the movement; witty chronicles of events in each city center; a selected bibliography; and biographiesof each artist—accompanied by Dada-era photographs."
The Elegance Of The Hedgehog,['Muriel Barbery'],"An enchanting <i>New York Times</i> and international bestseller and award-winner about life, art, literature, philosophy, culture, class, privilege, and power, seen through the eyes of a 54-year old French concierge and a precocious but troubled 12-year-old girl.
<p>Renée Michel is the 54-year-old concierge of a luxury Paris apartment building. Her exterior (“short, ugly, and plump”) and demeanor (“poor, discreet, and insignificant”) belie her keen, questing mind and profound erudition. Paloma Josse is a 12-year-old genius who behaves as everyone expects her to behave: a mediocre pre-teen high on adolescent subculture, a good but not outstanding student, an obedient if obstinate daughter. She plans to kill herself on the sixteenth of June, her thirteenth birthday.</p>
<p>Both Renée and Paloma hide their true talents and finest qualities from the bourgeois families around them, until a wealthy Japanese gentleman named Ozu moves into building. Only he sees through them, perceiving the secret that haunts Renée, winning Paloma's trust, and helping the two discover their kindred souls. Moving, funny, tender, and triumphant, Barbery's novel exalts the quiet victories of the inconspicuous among us.</p>"
A Mennonite Woman: Exploring Spiritual Life And Identity,['Dawn Ruth Nelson'],"As Sara Wenger Shenk, President-Elect, Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary, puts it, ""Rooting Mennonite spirituality within the earthy settledness of her grandmother's story, Nelson lovingly shows the way toward a spirituality of pilgrimage, in the company of Jesus"" In a book that is part narrative, part theology, part spiritual memoir, Dawn Ruth Nelson draws on a Mennonite background, encounter with Irish Catholic faith, and the spiritual life she discovers in her grandmother and her own everyday life to propose contemporary forms of spiritual formation and expression. ""Although Nelson's six suggestions for contemporary spirituality are focused on Mennonite tradition and experience,"" observes Joann Wolski Conn, Professor of Christian Spirituality, Neumann University, ""their transforming power make them applicable for anyone desiring Christian formation."" C. Arnold Snyder, Professor of History, Conrad Grebel University College, comments that ""Nelson's search leads from her grandmother's life in Mennonite community, through peace work in Ireland and engagement with the Roman Catholic tradition, and finally to the essential inner/outer balance of the Anabaptist spiritual tradition-a response of discipleship made possible by the spiritual connection to the living vine, Jesus Christ."""

Five of the Few,['Steve Darlow'],"Churchill's 'Few' will forever be remembered by history as men who thwarted the seemingly invincible German war machine, when all seemed lost. They countered the full force of the Luftwaffe in the daylight battles during the summer of 1940, and in the night skies of the winter and spring of 1940/41. They were at the time, and still are, perceived as knights of the air, as our heroes. Now, five distinguished RAF airmen, four pilots and one radar operator/navigator, who fought that air battle during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, have recounted their experiences in detail to author Steve Darlow. Their stories have never before been published, and they talk engagingly of their service life, combats, losses, injuries, friendships and fears - flying Spitfires, Hurricanes, Blenheims, Beaufighters and Havocs. One pilot tells of the time he fell victim to the enemy - 'My Spitfire stopped being a flying machine, it became a lump of metal. I was going down with it and I couldn't get out. I broke the seat by standing on it. The pressure throwing me into the bottom was terrific . . . ' A Beaufighter radar operator remembers being involved in shooting down a German aircraft - 'He took a vertical dive, struck the ground and exploded with a shower of incendiaries. I felt like a child with a new toy. I had at last proved myself but for some reason I suddenly felt a little sad.' But Five of the Few is not just about the experiences of these men during 1940/41. They would also distinguish themselves in subsequent air campaigns - night defense of the UK, offensive operations over the continent and support to D-Day and beyond. In between the aerial combats and ground attack operations, promotions, decorations and command responsibilities would come their way. But not all would make it through safely to the end of the war. One would end up behind barbed wire. Collectively Five of the Few is a war story of youth maturing, through aspiration and idealism, courage and bravado, fear and heroism, memory and reflection. It is a reminder of why so much was owed, and still is, by so many to so few."

Food Of Life: Ancient Persian And Modern Iranian Cooking And Ceremonies,['Najmieh Batmanglij'],"Completely redesigned for today's generation of cooks and food enthusiasts, the 25th Anniversary Edition ofFood of Life: Ancient Persian and Modern Iranian Cooking and Ceremonies by Najmieh Batmanglij (Mage; 640 pages); provides a treasure trove of recipes, along with an immersive cultural experience for those seeking to understand this ancient and timeless cuisine. This edition is a more user-friendly edition of the award-winning and critically acclaimed cookbook series which began in 1986. Food of Life provides 330 classical and regional Iranian recipes as well as an introduction to Persian art, history and culture. The book's hundreds of full color photographs are intertwined with descriptions of ancient and modern Persian ceremonies, poetry, folktales, travelogue excerpts and anecdotes. The 2011 Edition of Food of Life is a labor of love. The book began in exile after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as a love letter to Batmanglij's children. Today, as accomplished adults in their own fields, her two sons, Zal and Rostam, encouraged her to redesign the book for their generation.
<p>Food of Life propels Persian cooking into the 21st Century, even as it honors venerable traditions and centuries of artistic expression. It is the result of 30 years of collecting, testing and adapting authentic and traditional Persian recipes for the American kitchen. Most of its ingredients are readily available throughout the U.S. enabling anyone from a master chef to a novice to reproduce the refined tastes, textures, and beauty of Persian cuisine. Food-related pieces from such classics as the 10th century Book of Kings, and 1,001 Nights to the miniatures of Mir Mosavvar and Aq Mirak, from the poetry of Omar Khayyam and Sohrab Sepehri to the humor of Mulla Nasruddin are all included. Each recipe is presented with steps that are logical and easy to follow. Readers learn how to simply yet deliciously cook rice, the jewel of Persian cooking, which, when combined with a little meat, fowl, or fish, vegetables, fruits, and herbs, provides the perfect balanced diet.</p>
<p>The full-color Food of Life 25th Anniversary Edition contains 50% more pages than its 2009 predecessor and special added features:<br>

<p>Batmanglij's cookbooks reflect the tradition and culture of her Persian background and the multi-tasking demands of a busy mother and professional. She views preparing a meal not only as a culinary experience, but also as a means to bring family and friends together. She encourages her readers to do as she was taught in Iran: to cook, to laugh, to tell jokes and stories, and to recite poetry. Over the past quarter century, Batmanglij's books have acted as both a beacon and a bible to Iranian-American and mixed-ethnicity families in the English-speaking world. Food of Life is one of the few volumes whose breadth ranges from the exacting measures that go into cooking a perfect bowl of rice to the intricacies of a traditional ancient Persian marriage ceremony. Her life and her work meet at the vortex of feminism, tradition, ceremony, and the nourishment of body and mind, proving that none of these concepts need be foreign to one another.</p>
<p>ABOUT PERSIAN FOOD<br>
You know more about Persian food than you might think. When you ask for oranges, pistachios, spinach, or saffron, you are using words derived from Persian that refer to foods either originating in the region or introduced from there, for Persia was a great entrepôt of the ancient and medieval worlds. The land was the first home of many common herbs, including basil cilantro, and spices such as fenugreek and cumin, as well as vegetables that include fava beans and chickpeas. Iran was also home to scores of familiar preparations, including sweet and sour sauces, kababs, noodles, marzipan, and baklava. Such preparations are most delicious in their original forms, which you will find in the recipes in this book.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE PERSIAN NEW YEAR<br>
The publication of this book coincides with the arrival of the Persian new year, Nowruz. Nowruz is the most important holiday for Iranians all over the world. Nowruz ceremonies consist of a series of symbolic rituals dating back to pre-Islamic ancient times. Nowruz is not a religious holiday but a celebration of the earth, which everyone can enjoy wherever they are and whatever their religion may be. The Nowruz celebrationalways begins on the first day of spring marked by the vernal equinox, or Tahvil, when the sun crosses the celestial equator. This year Nowruz falls on March 20 at 7:21 PM Eastern DST.</p>
<p>To welcome the new year, Iranians thoroughly clean and rearrange their homes. They buy new clothes, bake pastries, germinate seeds, color eggs, and prepare a menu of green dishes as signs of renewal. Troubadours, called Haji Firuz or ""heralds of rebirth,"" disguised with makeup and wearing red outfits, sing and dance through the streets with tambourines, kettle drums, and trumpets to spread good cheer and the news of the coming new year. In every Iranian household a ceremonial setting called sofreh-ye haft sinn is spread to symbolize rebirth and renewal, and to welcome the arrival of the new year (see page 562).</p>
<p>ABOUT THE USE OF PERSIAN AND IRANIAN IN FOOD OF LIFE<br>
All the recipes come from the land Europeans have long called Persia. That name is the Hellenized form of Pars, the southwestern province that was the homeland of the rulers of the first Persian Empire. They, however, called themselves Iranians and their country Iran, the name of their ancestral tribes. Nowadays the words are used interchangeably, describing a people whose civilization and cuisine are ancient indeed. Cooking plays important roles in every culture, but Persian cuisine can claim a relationship to its native land that is uniquely deep and intricate. This book celebrates the central place of food in the life of Iran, a story extending back almost 4,000 years, when recipes were first recorded in a cuneiform script on clay tablets.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE BOOK'S TITLE<br>
Food of Life, the title of the book, comes from the Persian words nush-e jan, literally ""food of life""—a traditional wish in Iran that a dish will be enjoyed. For the updated 1993 edition the title was changed to New Food of Life.Now, for the 25th anniversary edition the title returns to its original name, Food of Life.</p>"

Home And Away: A Story Of Family In A Time Of War,"['Nancy French', 'David French']","David French picked up the newspaper in the comfort of his penthouse in Philadelphia, and read about a soldier - father of two - who was wounded in Iraq. Immediately, he was stricken with a question: Why him and not me?<br>
 This is the story of what happens when a person - rather a family - answers the call to serve their nation. David was a 37-year-old father of two, a Harvard Law graduate and president of a free speech organization. In other words, he was used to pushing pencils, not toting M16s.<br>
 His wife Nancy was raising two children and writing from home. She was worrying about field trips and playdates, not about her husband going to war.<br>
 HOME AND AWAY chronicles not just a soldier at war, but a family at war - a husband in Iraq, a wife and children at home, greeting each day with hope and fear, facing the challenge with determination, tears, and more than a little joy."

East Wind,"['Ruth Hunt', 'Maria Zeitner Linke']","East Wind is the incredible story of Maria Zeitner Linke—of her indomitable spirit and courageous faith as she faced the death camps and prisons of Stalin's Russia. “Only one who has felt the nearness of death can truly be grateful for each new day, no matter how much suffering it might bring.” 
<p>Thus speaks Maria Linke, survivor of nine years' imprisonment in the death camps and prisons of Stalin's Russia following World War II. There have been many “God is faithful amid the horrors of war” stories, and although East Wind fits this description, it is far more than just another war story. The unusual aspects of Maria's life make this book so arrestingly different. The winsome portrait of a childhood lived on the banks of the Volga River as the daughter of a wealthy pre-Revolution German industrialist . . . The tragedy of banishment to Siberia and life among the nomadic tribes there . . . The flight from a burning Cossack village and escape to Germany during the Russian Revolution . . . Teen years in lively Berlin . . . World War II and her work as an interpreter in the labor camps of Germany . . . Her arrest as a spy by the advancing Russian armies . . . Miraculous escapes from death . . . Romance . . . The infamous Waldeheim trials . . . And transcending it all, the rare sense of humor that could find laughter in the most horrible of circumstances.</p>
<p>East Wind is a powerful book. Historically, its scope is broad. Spiritually, its impact is tremendous. It will be a long time before you find another story that will move you as much as Maria's. From the Publisher: First published in 1976 as a hardcover, The Berean Call is pleased to present this new facsimile of the 1987 paperback edition, with a special commemorative cover design utilizing authentic historical images (see photo section inside book).</p>
<p>As an apologetics and discernment ministry, TBC encourages the broadcasting and defense of the true Gospel of Christ worldwide and seeks to support the modern persecuted church around the globe. It is our conviction that this true account must be kept in print not only as an inspirational testimony to the faithfulness of God but also as a matter of valuable historical record to the generations unfamiliar with the trials of World War II.

<p>From the back cover: Nine years in a Soviet prison camp would seem an eternity to most of us. For Maria, it was an investment in eternity. This is the true story of Maria Zeitner Linke—a story of survival and courage in the death camps of Stalin's Gulag after World War II. But more than that, it is the story of how one woman turned her sorrow into an opportunity for growth, ministry, and strengthened commitment to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In nine years, Maria moved through six different camps, including the infamous Buchenwald, which the Soviets had taken over from the Nazis after the war. In the process, Maria touched the lives of many people and helped them turn their own mourning into dancing. This book, which will remind many readers of the works of Corrie ten Boom and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, offers encouragement and hope to anyone who has ever wondered, “How would I react if my faith were really put to the test?” It comes to terms with the true meaning of “practicing patience in tribulation.”</p>
<p>Maria Zeitner Linke was born in Russia in 1908 to German parents and spent six years of her childhood in the rugged work camps of Siberia. She came to the United States in 1957 and became a citizen in 1963. She died of cancer in 1978.</p>

"Twilight Of The Gods: A Swedish Waffen-ss Volunteer's Experiences With The 11th Ss-panzergrenadier Division 'nordland', Eastern Front 1944-45",['Thorolf Hillblad'],"Few new personal accounts by Waffen-SS soldiers appear in English; even fewer originate from the multitude of non-German European volunteers who formed such an important proportion of this service's manpower. Twilight of the Gods was originally written in Swedish, and published in Buenos Aires shortly after the end of WWII. Erik Wallin, a Swedish soldier who volunteered for service with the Waffen-SS, and participated in the climactic battles on the Eastern Front during late 1944 and 1945, later telling his story to this book's editor, Thorolf Hillblad.<br>
<br>
Wallin served with the Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion, 11th SS-Panzergrenadier Division Nordland, a unit composed mainly of non-German volunteers, including Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. The division enjoyed a high reputation for its combat capability, and was always at the focal points of the fighting on the Eastern Front in the last year of the war. During this period it saw combat in the Baltic, in Pomerania, on the Oder, and finally in defence of Berlin, where it was destroyed.<br>
<br>
Erik Wallin served with his unit in all of these locations, and provides the reader with a fascinating glimpse into these final battles. The book is written with a 'no holds barred' approach which will captivate, excite and maybe even shock the reader - his recollections do not evade the brutality of fighting against the advancing Red Army. Twilight of the Gods is destined to become a classic memoir of the Second World War. <br>"

Sweet Home: Over 100 Heritage Desserts And Ideas For Preserving Family Recipes,['Rebecca Miller Ffrench'],"Food writer and stylist Rebecca Ffrench comes from a long line of dessert lovers. She fondly remembers the special bonding time her grandparents had over dessert. The smell of fresh baked brownies transports her back into her mother’s kitchen where there was always some kind of foil-covered treat waiting on the counter. And, even today, she rarely lets the week go by without baking something for her family. Just as she remembers her mother’s warm, chocolatey pudding cake more fondly than her Monday meatloaf, Rebecca wants her own kids’ memories of dessert to be equally vivid. It was this very sense of nostalgia for these family heirloom recipes that planted the seeds for her first cookbook. After the loss of a beloved aunt, Rebecca came into possession of the aunt’s journal. It turned out that this journal was not only filled with memories but also a lifetime of recipes—recipes that would have been lost had they not been recorded and passed on. This inspired Rebecca to begin recording her family’s history and heritage through cakes and cookies, pies and puddings, tarts and treats, and in this book, she includes more than 75 of her family’s favorite “I’m home!” treats, from an ooey-gooey “Go-To” Hot Fudge Pudding Cake to a moist, dense Coconut Bunny Cake that Rebecca’s dad perfected to please his granddaughters. Any recipe you pick from her list sounds lush and tempting: Love Struck Sour Cherry Pie, Norwegian Custard Buns, Spiced Apple Cider Doughnuts, No-Fail Caramel Sauce, Criss-Cross Apricot Coffeecake—the list goes deliciously on and on. Broken down into Preserving, Celebrating, Giving, and Creating, SWEET HOME teaches readers not only how to make delectable desserts, but how to keep your family’s traditions alive. Whether she’s preserving her Norwegian heritage by making Cloudberry Krumkaker Cones, celebrating Halloween with a Spooktacular Cheesecake, giving Kahlua Pound Cake through the post, or creating a new family tradition by making her father’s Chocolate Mudslide Cookies, Rebecca Miller Ffrench shows you how easy—and delicious—it is to make your home a sweet one. Add in the warm and winning headnotes on family and baking, tips to make each dish a success, and a special Baking Notes and Pantry section, and SWEET HOME is a recipe for a dessert classic—the perfect go-to guide for families wanting to preserve their history through recipes and food."

"Novels And Stories, 1959-1962 (library Of America)",['Philip Roth'],"For the last half century, the novels of Philip Roth have re-energized American fiction and redefined its possibilities. Roth's comic genius, his imaginative daring, his courage in exploring uncomfortable truths, and his assault on political, cultural, and sexual orthodoxies have made him one of the essential writers of our time. By special arrangement with the author, The Library of America now inaugurates the definitive edition of Roth's collected works. This first volume presents <i>Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories</i>, the book that established Roth's reputation on publication in 1959 and for which he won the National Book Award, and his first novel, <i>Letting Go</i> (1962).
<p>The title novella, <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, the story of a summer romance between a poor young man from Newark and a rich Radcliffe co-ed, is both a tightly wrought tale of youthful desire and a satiric gem that takes aim at the comfortable affluence of the postwar boom. Here and in the stories that accompany it, including ""The Conversion of the Jews"" and ""Defender of the Faith,"" Roth depicts Jewish lives in 1950s America with an unflinching sharpness of observation.</p>
<p>In <i>Letting Go</i>, a sprawling novel set largely against the backdrop of Chicago in the 1950s, Roth portrays the moral dilemmas of young people cast precipitously into adulthood, and in the process describes a skein of social and family responsibilities as they are brought into focus by issues of marriage, abortion, adoption, friendship, and career. The novel's expansiveness provides a wide scope for Roth's gift for vivid characterization, and in his protagonist Gabe Wallach he creates a nuanced portrait of a responsive young academic whose sense of morality draws him into the ordeals of others with unforeseen consequences.</p>"
An Ecology Of Enchantment: A Year In The Life Of A Garden,['Des Kennedy'],"For the past 36 years, <b>Des Kennedy</b> and his family have lived largely outside their hand-built house in intimate contact with the Earth —&nbsp;its creatures, its changing seasons, and its weather patterns.

Undaunted by setbacks and&nbsp;lusting for the perfect garden, Kennedy takes readers with him on a gardening journey rich with insights and adventures. The effects of devastating snow storms; the slow-food cuisine of rutabagas, parsnips, and carrots; the gardener's inalienable right to dress in rags; the outlandish behaviour and florid oratory induced by flowering poppies — these and scores of other topics meander through the book's gardening year alternately informing, inspiring, and amusing.<br>"

<br>
In Me and My Hair you’ll hear the voices of women from around Britain talking about their hair - whether it’s their longing to have ‘Shirley Temple’ curls, the visits of the nit nurse, their first home perm, roasting under hood dryers, going platinum blonde, hilarious experiments with hair extensions, or fears of going grey."

Vulcan Test Pilot: My Experiences In The Cockpit Of A Cold War Icon,['Tony Blackman'],"In 2007 a restored Avro Vulcan Mark 2 - XH558 - took to the skies to help commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Falklands conflict. To coincide with this the memoirs of one of its test pilots, Tony Blackman, was published to great acclaim. Now the first book about test flying this monumental delta-wing aircraft which dominated the history of the late 20th century is available in paperback. <br>
<br>
Tony is the ideal man to write such a tale as he flew no less than 105 of the 136 built, logging 850 flights at over 1,327 hours. His book describes in layman's terms what it was like to tame the first prototypes and to master the unusual characteristics necessitated by the Vulcan's shape. <br>
<br>
Although Tony puts the developments, demonstrations, incidents and accidents in their political and historical context, his story is a highly personal one. He explains how this awesome aircraft became a national treasure and captured the imagination of the whole country. His words, descriptions and hitherto largely unpublished photographs will make people feel as he did the excitement of handling such an incredibly powerful monster always in the knowledge that he had to be in complete charge all the time as the monster could and did bite back."

Ironies Of Faith: The Laughter At The Heart Of Christian Literature,"['Esolen, Anthony M.']","In Ironies of Faith, celebrated Dante scholar and translator Anthony Esolen provides a profound meditation upon the use and place of irony in Christian art and in the Christian life. Esolen explores the ironies of time (for Christians believe in divine Providence, but live in a world whose moments pass away); the ironies of power (for Christians believe in an almighty God who took on human flesh, and whose ""weakness"" is stronger than death); the ironies of love (for man seldom knows whom to love, or how, or even whom it is that in the depths of his heart he loves best); and the figure of the Child (for Christians believe that unless we become like unto one of these little ones, we shall not enter the Kingdom of God).
<p>This finely wrought study draws from Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare, Tolkien, Mauriac, Milton, Herbert, Hopkins, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky, among others, including the anonymous author of the medieval poem Pearl. Such authors, Anthony Esolen believes, teach us that the last laugh is on the world, because that grim old world, taking itself so seriously that even its laughter is a sneer, will finally-despite its proud resistance-be redeemed. That is the ultimate irony of faith.</p>"
Dashiell Hammett: Crime Stories And Other Writings (library Of America),['Dashiell Hammett'],"In the stories and novellas he wrote for Black Mask and other pulp magazines in the 1920s and 1930s, Dashiell Hammett took the detective story and turned it into a medium for capturing the jarring textures and revved-up cadences of modern American life. In this volume, The Library of America collects the finest of these stories: 24 in all, along with some revealing essays and an earlier version of his novel The Thin Man.
<p>Mixing melodramatic panache and poker-faced comedy, a sensitivity to place and a perceptive grasp of social conflict, Hammett's stories are hard-edged entertainments for an era of headlong change and extravagant violence. For the heroic sagas of earlier eras Hammett substituted the up-tempo, devious, sometimes nearly nihilistic exploits of con men and blackmailers, fake spiritualists and thieving politicians, slumming socialites and deadpan assassins.</p>
<p>As a guide through this underworld he created the Continental Op, the nameless, laconic detective, world-weary and unblinking, who serves as protagonist of most of these stories. The deliberately unheroic Op is separated only by his code of professionalism from the brutality and corruption that run rampant in stories such as ""Zigzags of Treachery,"" ""Dead Yellow Women,"" ""Fly Paper,"" and ""$106,000 Blood Money.""</p>
<p> Hammett's years of experience as a Pinkerton detective give even his most outlandishly plotted mysteries a gritty credibility, and his intimate knowledge of San Francisco made him the perfect chronicler of that city's waterfronts, back alleys, police stations, and luxury hotels. By connecting crime fiction to the realities of American streets and American speech, his Black Mask stories opened up new vistas for generations of writers and readers.</p>"
Memories Of The Southern Civil Rights Movement By Danny Lyon (2010) Hardcover,['Danny Lyon'],"In the summer of 1962, Danny Lyon, a twenty-year-old University of Chicago history student, packed a Nikon Reflex and an old Leica in an army bag and hitch-hiked south. Within a week he was in jail in Albany, Georgia, looking through the bars at another prisoner, Martin Luther King, Jr. Lyon soon became the first staff photographer for the Atlanta-based Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which already had a reputation as one of the most committed and confrontational groups fighting for civil rights. In Memories of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, Lyon tells the compelling story of how a handful of dedicated young people, both black and white, forged one of the most successful grassroots organizations in American history. In addition to his own photographs, Lyon includes here a selection of historic SNCC documents such as press releases, telephone logs, letters, and minutes of meetings. This combination of pictures, contemporary eyewitness reports, and text creates both a work of art and an authentic work of history. As SNCC's staff photographer, Danny Lyon was present at some of the most violent and dramatic moments of civil rights history: Black Monday in Danville, Virginia; the aftermath of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the March on Washington in 1963; the violent winters of 1963 and 1964 in Atlanta; and the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. But Lyon's photographs are more than just a record of marches, jailings, and protests. They take us inside the movement - to the meetings, organizing work, and voter registration drives that were the less visible but no less important side of the struggle. By the time Danny Lyon left SNCC and the South in 1964, there was an emerging focus on black consciousness in the organization. The movement was changing course and pointing North. Many people have since forgotten the idealistic and truly multiracial character of the movement's early years. Lyon's pictures, taken d

Biting The Wax Tadpole: Confessions Of A Language Fanatic,"['Little, Elizabeth , 1981-']","In this decidedly unstuffy look at the staid world of languages, Elizabeth Little uses her favorite examples from languages dead, difficult, and just plain made-up to reveal how language study is the ticket to traveling the world—without leaving the comforts of home. Little’s exploration of “word travel” includes:
<p>• Shona, a language lacking distinct words for “blue” or “green”<br>
• Why Icelandic speakers must decide if the numbers 1-4 are plural<br>
• Which language is the only one lacking verbs<br>
• Just what, exactly, the Swedish names of IKEA products mean</p>
<p>Fully illustrated with hilarious sidebars, <i>Biting The Wax Tadpole</i> also addresses classic cases of mistranslation. For example, when Chinese shopkeepers tried to find a phonetic written equivalent of Coca-Cola, one set of characters they chose were pronounced “ke-kou ke-la.” It sounded right, but it translated literally as “bite the wax tadpole.” Not quite what Coke had in mind, but in this off-kilter ode to the words of the world, it’s just another example of language taking you someplace interesting.</p>"

The book discusses what to pack and what to leave behind: products and services that make traveling with children easier; what to know when children travel alone; entertaining travel games; and trips abroad, from metric diapers to baby jet lag. In addition, it lists dozens of resources and references: travel agencies that specialize in families; addresses and phone numbers for children's museums and national parks; where to see dinosaurs; online resources; and special tips on surviving Disneyland."

James Agee: Film Writing And Selected Journalism (loa #160): Agee On Film / Uncollected Film Writing / The Night Of The Hunter / Journalism  And Film Reviews (library Of America James Agee Edition),['James Agee'],"James Agee brought to bear all his moral energy, slashing wit, and boundless curiosity in the criticism and journalism that established him as one of the commanding literary voices of America at mid-century. In 1944 W. H. Auden called Agee's film reviews for <i>The Nation</i> ""the most remarkable regular event in American journalism today."" Those columns, along with much of the movie criticism that Agee wrote for <i>Time</i> through most of the 1940s, were collected posthumously in <i>Agee on Film: Reviews and Comments</i>, undoubtedly the most influential writings on film by an American.
<p>Whether reviewing a Judy Garland musical or a wartime documentary, assessing the impact of Italian neorealism or railing against the compromises in a Hollywood adaptation of Hemingway, Agee always wrote of movies as a pervasive, profoundly significant part of modern life, a new art whose classics (Chaplin, Dovzhenko, Vigo) he revered and whose betrayal in the interests of commerce or propaganda he often deplored. If his frequent disappointments could be registered in acid tones, his enthusiasms were expressed with passionate eloquence. This Library of America volume supplements the classic pieces from <i>Agee on Film</i> with previously uncollected writings on Ingrid Bergman, the Marx Brothers, Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Lifeboat</i>, Vittorio De Sica's <i>Shoeshine</i>, and a wealth of other cinematic subjects.</p>
<p>Agee's own work as a screenwriter is represented by his script for Charles Laughton's unique and haunting masterpiece of Southern gothic, <i>The Night of the Hunter</i>, adapted from the novel by Davis Grubb. This collection also includes examples of Agee's masterfully probing reporting for <i>Fortune</i>—on subjects as diverse as the Tennessee Valley Authority, commercial orchids, and cockfighting—and a sampling of his literary reviews, among them appreciations of William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, S. J. Perelman, and William Carlos Williams.</p>"

Ken Jones: Boots & Spikes,['Steve Lewis'],"Ken Jones was a former British Lions, Wales and Newport wing as well as a sprinter good enough to win an Olympic silver medal. He died at the age of 84 in 2006. Jones started his rugby career with local side Blaenavon and Pontypool before joining Newport in time for the 1946-47 season. He won 44 caps for Wales - 43 of them in consecutive matches - which was a Welsh record until overtaken by Gareth Edwards. Jones scored 17 tries for Wales. He also played three Tests for the British and Irish Lions during the 1950 tour to New Zealand.<br>
 An all-round athlete, Jones represented Britain at the 1948 Olympics in London and won silver in the 4x100m relay. He and his teammates were actually presented with gold medals because the USA were disqualified. But he had to return the medal because the USA had been reinstated!<br>
 Jones captained Britain at the European Games in Berne in 1954 and represented Wales at the Empire Games in 1954 in Vancouver. He was the Welsh sprint champion for seven consecutive years, using that pace on the rugby field to score 146 tries in 293 games for Newport, captaining the side in 1950-51 and 1953-54. For his services to sport, Jones was awarded the OBE in 1960."

Train Your Brain: 60 Days To A Better Brain,['Dr Ryuta Kawashima'],"This innovative brain health workbook has sold over 2.5 million copies globally!
<p>Dr. Kawashima, a prominent neurologist in Japan, developed this program of daily simple math calculations that can help boost your brain power, improve your memory, and stave off the mental effects of aging. The exercises in this book have even been shown to help those suffering from Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The idea, Dr. Kawashima says, is to ""work out the brain much like we work out the rest of our bodies. It has long been known that regular exercise helps slow the deterioration of our muscles, and the same is true for our brains.""</p>
<p><i>From the Author</i></p>
<p>""I have developed a program of keeping your brain young that consists of a daily program of simple calculations. It may sound too simple to be true, but my research has shown that this activity increases regional cerebral blood flow to the largest portions of the brain and stimulates the creation of neural pathways.</p>
<p>We all age, and it is only natural that our brains age too. The good news is that mental decline is not inevitable. We can keep our bodies younger and healthier through regular exercise. The same is true for the brain - if you exercise your brain, you can prevent your cerebral function from deteriorating.</p>

Philip Roth: Novels 1967-1972: When She Was Good / Portnoy's Complaint / Our Gang / The Breast (library Of America),['Philip Roth'],"This second volume presents four extraordinarily diverse works displaying the range and originality of his fictional art.
<p><i>When She Was Good</i> (1967) is the trenchant portrait of Lucy Nelson, a young midwestern woman whose perception of her own suffering turns her into a ferocious force, ""enemy-ridden and unforgivingly defiant,"" as Roth would later describe her. A small-town 1940s America of restrictive social pressures and foreclosed opportunities provides the novel's background.</p>
<p>The publication of the hilarious <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> (1969) was a cultural event that turned Roth into a reluctant celebrity. The confession of a bewildered psychoanalytic patient thrust through life by his unappeasable sexuality yet held back by the iron grip of his unforgettable childhood, Portnoy unleashed Roth's comic virtuosity and opened new avenues for American fiction.</p>
<p>In <i>Our Gang</i> (1971), described by Anthony Burgess as a ""brilliant satire in the real Swift tradition,"" Roth effects a savage takedown of the administration of Richard Nixon (who figures here as Trick E. Dixon). Written before the revelations of the Watergate scandal, <i>Our Gang</i> continues to resonate as a broad and outraged response to the clownish hypocrisy and moral theatrics of the American political scene.</p>
<p>The Kafkaesque excursion <i>The Breast</i> (1972) introduces David Kepesh in the first volume of a trilogy that continues with <i>The Professor of Desire</i> (1977) and <i>The Dying Animal</i> (2001). <i>The Breast</i> prompted Cynthia Ozick to remark, ""One knows when one is reading something that will permanently enter the culture.""</p>"

The Solar House: Passive Solar Heating And Cooling,"['Chiras, Daniel D.']","This text presents a relatively nontechnical description of passive solar heating and cooling principles that can be used in the construction of homes heated and cooled simply through the absorption or dissipation of sunlight. The author, who has designed a number of these homes, discusses region-specific design strategies, the integration of environmentally friendly back-up heat, the maintenance of indoor air quality, and step- by-step design processes.

H. P. Lovecraft: Tales (loa #155) (library Of America),['H. P. Lovecraft'],"This volume brings together 22 tales, the very best of Howard Phillips Lovecraft's fiction. Early stories such as ""The Outsider,"" ""The Music of Erich Zann,"" ""Herbert West - Reanimator,"" and ""The Lurking Fear"" demonstrate Lovecraft's uncanny ability to blur the distinction between reality and nightmare, sanity and madness, the human and the non-human. ""The Horror at Red Hook"" and ""He"" reveal the fascination and revulsion Lovecraft felt for New York City; ""Pickman's Model"" uncovers the frightening secret behind an artist's work; ""The Rats in the Walls"" is a terrifying descent into atavistic horror; and ""The Colour Out of Space"" explores the eerie impact of a meteorite on a remote Massachusetts valley."
Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits 1905-1920,"['Augustus F. Sherman', 'Peter Mesenholler']","Throughout his tenure as a registry clerk with the Immigration Division of Ellis Island, Augustus F. Sherman systematically photographed more than 200 families, groups, and individuals while they were being held by customs for special investigations. This volume collects and provides an essential revaluation of Sherman's striking portraits, which predate August Sander's cataloging efforts by several years. A historical document of unprecedented worth, <i>Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits</i> includes almost one-hundred portraits taken from 1905 through 1920. The subjects are frequently dressed in elaborate national costumes or folk dress, emphasizing the variety and richness of the cultural heritage that came together to form the United States. Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, Russian vegetarians, Greek priests, and Ghanaian women in elaborately patterned dresses, are treated with equal gravitas. The resulting body of work presents a unique and powerful picture of the stream of immigrants who came through Ellis Island. In its time, the material contributed to the larger project of ethnographic categorization and typology typical of the early twentieth century, much as Edward S. Curtis's portraits romanticized the last Indians or John Thomson's Street Life in London identified and codified social class in the late 1800s. Though originally taken for his own personal study, Sherman's work appeared in the public eye as illustrations for publications with titles such as Alien or American, and hung on the walls of the custom offices as cautionary or exemplary models of the new American species. <br> <br>In this book, Peter Mesenh ller, Research Associate with theRautenstrauch-Joest-Museum of Anthropology in Cologne, Germany, provides new critical context and analysis of this rich collection, but also addresses the individual images as powerful, engaging photographs created by a master portraitist. <br> <br>The publication is accompanied by a traveling exhibition that will open at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum in the summer of 2005."

Among the 54 works gathered in this collection, which brings together the first four English-language volumes of Singer's stories, is his enduring parable of probity and goodness, ""Gimpel the Fool,"" as well as the disturbing supernatural tales that explore irrational undercurrents of human personality and collective life.

Ulysses S. Grant: Defender Of The Union (civil War Generals),['Earle Rice'],"Ulysses S. Grant was born to a family of humble means. Though initially reluctant to do so, he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point. After serving with distinction during the Mexican War, Grant found that postwar army life would not earn him enough money to care for his family. Seven years later, Grant returned to uniform with the outbreak of the Civil War. His willingness to fight, his organizational skills, and his bravery won him rapid promotion. He led several crucial campaigns in the West, culminating in the decisive capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863. President Lincoln then appointed him as the army's supreme commander. After months of bitter fighting, Grant accepted Confederate general Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. Grant was elected president in 1868 and served two terms. After leaving office, Grant died in 1885, just days after finishing his memoir. Ulysses S. Grant: Defender of the Union explores his life and his complex time for a new generation of readers."

Off To Class: Incredible And Unusual Schools Around The World,['Susan Hughes'],"When North American kids picture a school, odds are they see rows of desks, stacks of textbooks, and linoleum hallways. They probably don’t picture caves, boats, or train platforms — but there are schools in caves, and on boats and on train platforms. There’s a whole world of unusual schools out there!
<p>But the most amazing thing about these schools isn’t their location or what they look like. It’s that they provide a place for students who face some of the toughest environmental and cultural challenges, and live some of the most unique lifestyles, to learn. Education is not readily available for kids everywhere, and many communities are strapped for the resources that would make it easier for kids to go to school. In short, it’s not always easy getting kids off to class — but people around the world are finding creative ways to do it.</p>
<p>In <i>Off to Class</i>, readers will travel to dozens of countries to visit some of these incredible schools, and, through personal interviews, meet the students who attend them, too.

"Me, Stressed Out? (peanuts Wisdom)",['Charles M Schulz'],"""It seems beyond the comprehension of people that someone can be born to draw comic strips, but I think I was,"" said Charles M. Schulz, creator of PEANUTS. ""My ambition from earliest memory was to produce a daily comic strip."" And that was exactly what Schulz did everyday since PEANUTS debuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 26, 1922, Schulz was nicknamed ""Sparky"" after Barney Google's horse ""Sparkplug."" He began his fascination with comic strips early, reading the Sunday comics from four different newspapers with his father each week. With encouragement from his father, a barber, and his mother, Schulz enrolled in a correspondence course in cartooning at what is now the Art Instruction School, Inc. in Minneapolis. His career in cartooning was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the Army and soon embarked for Europe in the fight against Germany. Upon his return, Schulz landed his first job in cartooning at Timeless Topix, a Catholic comic magazine. Soon after, he took on a second job as a teacher at Art Instruction, where he worked with Charlie Brown, Linus and Frieda, who later lent their names to the PEANUTS comic strip. Schulz's first break came in 1947 when he sold a cartoon feature called ""Li'l Folks"" to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ""Li'l Folks"" ran as a weekly feature for two years. In 1948 he sold a cartoon panel to the Saturday Evening Post and would go on to sell 15 more panels between 1948-50. In 1950, after many mailbox rejections, Schulz boarded a train from St. Paul to New York with a handful of drawings for a meeting with United Feature Syndicate. On October 2 of that year, PEANUTS, named by the syndicate,debuted in seven newspapers. When asked if he thought the strip would be a success, Schulz replied, ""Sure, I thought it would last; in fact, when I started out I thought, 'I'll be drawing this for the rest of my life.'"" Almost 50 years later, PEANUTS appears in over 2,600 newspapers worldwide and Charles M. Schulz has become a household name. The strip has maintained its universal appeal throughout five distinctly different decades. ""As a youngster, I didn't realize how many Charlie Browns there were in the world,"" said Schulz. ""I thought I was the only one. Now I realize that Charlie Brown's goofs are familiar to everybody, adults and children alike."" Schulz would work six weeks ahead on daily and Sunday strips and, unlike many cartoonists, drew every comic strip without the assistance of an art staff. He also wrote all the scripts and storyboards for the PEANUTS television specials, earning him five Emmy and two Peabody Awards, and was involved in all aspects of the PEANUTS publishing and licensing programs through United Media Licensing in New York. His company, Creative Associates, was formed in 1970 to handle his business affairs and assist in maintaining the high quality standards associated with PEANUTS. Obviously, even after producing almost 18,000 comic strips, Schulz remained dedicated to PEANUTS. When questioned about the overwhelming devotion to his work, Schulz explained, ""Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."" Among other numerous honors, Schulz received two Reuben Awards from the National Cartoonists Society (Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Humor Strip) and was inducted into the Cartoonist Hall of Fame. Although the strip remained his first love, Schulz was an avid sports enthusiast with a long-time passion for golf (he regularly participated in the Pro Am at Pebble Beach, California). He also enjoyed tennis. Above all, he loved ice-skating and the game of hockey, and was the only non-hockey professional to be presented the coveted Lester Patrick Award for his contributions to the game. To share skating with his community, he built the Redwood Empire Ice Arena near his home in Santa Rosa, California. On February 12, 2000, Charles Schulz died in Santa Rosa, CA, of complications from colon cancer. It was only hours before his last original strip was to appear in Sunday papers. His wife, Jeannie, his five children, two stepchildren, and their families survive him."
Healing: A Journal Of Tolerance And Understanding,"['Muhammad Ali', 'Thomas Hauser', 'Richard Dominick']","""Muhammad Ali is the most loved person in the world. Everywhere he goes, wherever he goes, people of all colors and religions crowd around, hoping to get close to him. I've seen it happen so many times, and each time, I ask myself, 'If we can all get together and have a meeting of the minds on Ali, why can't we all get together, period?' I look at this man and I say to myself, 'God is trying to tell us something.'"" -- Thomas Hauser 
<p><i>Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding</i> Is a joint project by Muhammad Ali and Thomas Hauser (who authored the international bestsellers <i>Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times</i> and <i>Muhammad Ali: In Perspective</i>), as part of a multi-dimensional, international campaign to combat bigotry and prejudice.</p>
<p>This beautifully designed hardcover journal has been fashioned to encourage its readers to reflect on issues of tolerance, brotherhood and understanding. An introductory essay, written by Ali and Hauser, discusses these powerful issues and promotes empathy and awareness. Subsequent pages of the journal contain one or more illuminating quotations by a philosopher, a public figure or from a religious text, with space available on alternate pages for the reader to record his or her own thoughts.</p>
<p><i>Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding</i> can help each of us make a difference and Muhammad Ali is the ideal person to teach us how. Ali and Hauser's message is simple: ""If today's world is to be truly to be healed, that healing must be achieved one person at a time. The tolerance and understanding necessary to heal must come from each and every one of us, arising out of our everyday conduct, until decency reaches a flood tide.""</p>

Hardcore Troubadour: The Life And Near Death Of Steve Earle,['Lauren St John'],"<p>If Steve Earle weren't a living, breathing person he'd be a character in a blues song, a raucous ballad that would tell the tale of a gifted rebel who drank too much, lost his career and almost all of his women in a blizzard of heroin and crack-cocaine addiction, and lived wildly and extravagantly on the wrong side of the law.</p>
<p>Along the way, Earle has welded rock to country, the Beatles to Springsteen, Celtic to Americana, punk to bluegrass and has produced multiple Grammy-nominated albums and one enduring classic: Guitar Town. Like Hank Williams and Robert Johnson he has wandered across the American South; like Janis Joplin he has a huge capacity for self-destruction that matches an appetite for life in all its extremes. Like Stephen Foster, he is a storyteller and songwriter of rare skill and force whose sincerity echoes through all his work.</p>
<p>A heroin addict since the age of fourteen, six times married to five different women, a man who took a four-year 'vacation in the ghetto', Steve Earle none the less survived. And he came back with an artistic and personal vision intact, determined to change society for the better even as he seemed set to live his life for the worse.</p>
<p>Lauren St John has been allowed unrestricted access and cooperation by Steve, his family and friends. In exchange, she has written a hauntingly clear-eyed, unvarnished and uncompromising life of one of American music's talismanic sons.</p>"

How to Think About God: A Guide for the 20th-Century Pagan,['Mortimer J.

Without relying on faith, mysticism, or science (none of which, according to Dr. Adler, can prove or disprove the existence of God), he uses a rationalist argument to lead the reader to a point where he or she can see that the existence of God is not necessarily dependent upon a suspension of disbelief. Dr. Adler provides a nondogmatic exposition of the principles behind the belief that God, or some other supernatural cause, has to exist in some form. Through concise and lucid arguments, Dr. Adler shapes a highly emotional and often erratic conception of God into a credible and understandable concept for the lay person."

Requiem For The Heartland: The Oklahoma City Bombing,"['Cohen', 'David']","In an age of constant and instantaneous visual communication, we see disasters and calamities played out before our eyes every day. Images of plane crashes and typhoons, famines and war, murders and abuse come tumbling into our homes with soul-numbing regularity. 
<p>But the April 19, 1995, terrorist blast in Oklahoma City was somehow different. This wasn't Bosnia or Rwanda or even New York City. This was the heart of America. And if little children could not be completely safe at 9:02 in the morning in the America's Kids day care center in Oklahoma City, we all knew in a flash that none of us could ever be completely safe anywhere.</p>
<p>When we got over our initial shock, most Americans wondered, ""What can I do to help?"" There came a great outpouring of aid and concern. Rescuers flew to Oklahoma City from all over the country. Money and supplies were sent. Condolence posters were signed in 62 shopping malls. Prayers were sent over the Internet. Cards and letters arrived by the truckload. Enough flowers were sent to provide fresh bouquets for every household in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>We believe that it was America's reaction to the event, more than the event itself, that defines who we are. A few evil people blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, but it was a multitude of good-hearted Americans who came to the rescue and picked up the pieces. As often happens, it was the worst among us who managed to bring out our best.</p>
<p>More than 20 photographers contributed their film to make this book. As professionals, they must remain detached from the horror they witness, but this professional necessity does not stop them from caring deeply. This book was born of a desire on the part of the photographers, editors, writers, publishers, printers and bookstores to give something back, to somehow help the people who suffered.</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to the victims and their families and to all of the heroes of Oklahoma City (Editor's Note ).</p>"
Why I Am a Muslim : An American Odyssey,['Asma Gull Hasan'],"In the wake of 9-11, the activities of Osama Bin Laden and Hamas, and the recent Gulf War, the Western press have been filled with information and mis-information about the true nature of Islam. Is it a feudal misogynist belief system that is a threat to Western values? Is it an ideology of oppression? Or, is it a faith tradition that is as varied as Christianity, a big tent that includes not only the extremists that we read about in the daily press, but also a majority of followers who are committed to an authentic spirituality that embraces many of the values shared by the mainstream in Europe and America? Why I Am a Muslim is a gentle analysis of those issues. Part memoir and part guide, it represents the side of Islam that is left out of the daily newspapers. For Asma Hasan, being a Muslim is not merely a matter of birth, but a matter of choice. In seven chapters, she presents seven reasons why she is committed to Islam and why it is a viable spiritual option for anyone.<p> Based on her understanding of the Qur'an and her upbringing as a Muslim, she articulates a vision of Islam that is ethnically diverse, tolerant of others, and supportive of the rights of women. She presents a spiritual tradition that contains a rich mystical tradition and that allows individuals to have a direct relationship with God. Why I Am a Muslim is an important book that will provide readers everywhere with an understanding and appreciation of a frequently misunderstood religious tradition. Hasan successfully articulates a vision of one of the world's great religions that readers within and without Islam will find engaging and challenging.</p>"
Muhammad Ali In Perspective,"['Thomas Hauser', 'Muhammad Ali']","It wasn't easy, doing what Ali did in Atlanta. But this is a man who, all his life, has come up with one incredibly gutsy performance after another. There was no way he could beat Sonny Liston. So he went out and beat Sonny Liston. There was no way he'd give up his title. So as an act of principle, he gave up the heavyweight championship of the world. He beat George Foreman, when everyone knew he couldn't. He won the heavyweight crown for a third time, against Leon Spinks, when he was too old to win. Each time the world thought Ali was out of miracles, he performed another miracle. That's Muhammad Ali, In Perspective. And what you had in Atlanta was a wonderful reaffirmation of just how much Muhammad Ali means to the world. Three billion people were watching. Three billion people were in love with one man. Three billion people, even if it was just for a moment, had all the hate and petty prejudices removed from their hearts, and felt nothing but love. That's a miracle."

A Witness To Genocide: The 1993 Pulitzer Prize-winning Dispatches On The Ethnic Cleansing Of Bosnia,['Roy Gutman'],"Straight from today's front-page headlines comes this shocking firsthand account of the current genocide perpetrated by Bosnia's Serbs against that country's Muslims. A Witness to Genocide is a compilation of Newsday foreign correspondent Roy Gutman's reports from Bosnia, which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. Gutman and photographer Andree Kaiser (whose photos illustrate this book) were the first Western journalists to visit the death camps, and Gutman was the first to interview the survivors and report on the atrocities that were taking place there. His articles were partly responsible for the United Nations' condemnation of the camps and insistence that the International Red Cross be allowed to inspect them. The articles include survivors' accounts of being transported to the camps in cattle cars in which many died of starvation or suffocation, the systematic murder of prisoners, the government-ordered rape of all Muslim girls and women, and the destruction of the six-hundred-year-old Muslim cultural heritage, including over half of all mosques, historical sites, and libraries. Not since the Holocaust have such widespread, blatant, and unrestrained atrocities been committed against a defenseless minority.

Veerappan: India's Most Wanted Man,['Sunaad Raghuram'],"""Veerappan: poacher, smuggler, killer - a fugitive who for more than three decades has sustained a crime frenzy as action packed and outlandish as anything Hollywood (or even Bollywood) could conjure."" ""Determined to escape the crushing poverty of his childhood village, Veerappan was lured to a life of crime in his adolescence and eventually amassed a gang with as many as 150 members. He has kidnapped wealthy men, poached precious resources, and viciously ambushed police, killing more than a hundred. He stole such great quantities of explosives from nearby granite operations that the government ordered the industry to shut down. Yet to this day he has eluded capture, despite the government's creation of a special task force, the sole purpose of which is to stop him."" ""The impenetrable Indian jungle provides him with shelter and refuge, while villagers, whether from fear or admiration, protect him from the police, so that year after year he has grown bolder and more power hungry. His most audacious act to date - the kidnapping of India's biggest film star - caused nationwide public upheaval and brought the film industry to a halt, while his demands for ransom presented the government with a crippling legal dilemma."" Investigative journalist Sunaad Raghuram's researched report follows Veerappan's violent progression from a small-time poacher to the bloodthirsty criminal who has flouted the entire Indian police force and government for decades. Using the personal testimony of Veerappan's family members and closest associates, Raghuram recounts this outlaw's crimes and examines his personal life as well, including a surprisingly touching first person account of what Veerappan's wife has endured. Veerappan: India's Most Wanted Man details the methods and madness of a man alternately hailed as a messiah and condemned as a murderer."

Anna And The Duke,['Kathryn Smith'],"<h3 align=""center"">Chapter One</h3>
<i>Scotland, 1818</i>
<p>""Why don't you just pick one, then?""</p>
<p>Standing waist deep in the chilly waters of Loch Glenshea, Ewan MacLaughlin slicked his wet hair back from his face and stared dumbly at his cousin Jamie. ""Pick one what?""</p>
<p>With a sigh and an expression of exasperation, Jamie jerked his head in the direction of the shore. ""One of them.""</p>
<p>A crowd of girls from the village had gathered to watch the boys swim. Some of the girls were trying to goad the others into joining them, for the day was sunny and hot and they'd all been working since sunrise. None of the girls was actually brazen enough to wade in, however.</p>
<p>Ewan scoffed as the sound of giggling drifted across the water. ""What would I want to pick one of them for?""</p>
<p>Jamie scowled, drawing his dark auburn eyebrows together. ""Are ye daft as well as stubborn? So the rest of us might actually have a chance of choosing one as well!""</p>
<p>Ewan truly had no idea what his cousin was talking about, and he was certain he was neither stupid nor stubborn, but as he studied the girls on the shore he noticed that most of them were watching him. An uncomfortable realization settled in his chest. He'd never thought of himself as much of a catch before, but as an eligible, landowning young man of twenty-four, he realized that he was definitely seen as a catch.</p>
<p>I don't want one!"" he blurted with absolute certainty, his heart pounding in his chest. The idea of spending the rest of his life with one of those girls — any girl-filled him with dread.</p>
<p>Wanting to put a stop to this ridiculous conversation, he dove under the surface of the loch, each powerful stroke ofhis arms taking him farther away from his cousin and his absurd questions.</p>
<p>Him, a husband? The very thought filled him with horror. While many of the girls of his village were bonny to be sure, there was not one who caught his interest more than the others. Not one that set his heart pounding or made his palms damp. He couldn't imagine spending the rest of his life with a single one of them. What would they have in common? And what would they think of a husband who sometimes stayed up half the night reading or painting? A sensible Scottish lass would think him as daft as Jamie seemed to think him.</p>
<p>Lungs close to bursting, Ewan broke the surface of the lake, only to find Jamie coming up behind him, his long chestnut hair trailing like seaweed behind him. His cousin's fair skin had finally started to tan rather than burn, but he was still several shades lighter than Ewan. Jamie's complexion was the only delicate thing about him. He was pure Scot through and through-as strong as an ox and just as stubborn as one too. He had to be. It was the only way his family had survived The Clearances. They'd been kicked off their land by the wealthy landowners, and Jamie came to his cousin Ewan looking for work to support his family-and work he did. It was Ewan, the lord of the land, who wasn't a true Scot. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't change the fact that English blood also ran in his veins.</p>
<p>""What do you mean you don't want one?"" Jamie demanded, treading water beside him. ""You'll not find a more bonny lot anywhere-not even in the court of King George himself."" The statement wasn't meant to be insulting, of that Ewan was certain, but it stung all the same.</p>
<p>Ewan averted his gaze so his cousin couldn't see the guilt there. He was certain it was his father's blood — <i>English</i> blood-that made him want to taste the world beyond his tiny village of Lodi Glenshea, beyond Hadrian!s wall to the southern lands of England. He had no good reason to feel such a pull toward his father's homeland. In fact, he resisted it violently. His father had deserted Ewan and his mother years ago, leaving his mother to waste away and eventually die broken and in much lowered circumstances. Ewan had been very young, but memories of his mother were burned into his mind.</p>
<p>Ewan's one memory of him was of his father leaving after his mother's funeral. It was fuzzy, for he'd been just a wee lad of three. At the time, Ewan was glad to stay in Scotland with people he knew, but as he grew older he wondered why his father hadn't taken him with him, why he had left his son to struggle to keep his home standing and his people prosperous. He also wondered why he still thought about his father after all these years. He deserved none of Ewan's curiosity. He certainly didn't deserve the small bit of his son's heart that still ached at the thought of his father not wanting him.</p>
<p>""I have no desire to take a wife, Jamie:' he replied softly. He'd seen what marriage had done to his mother. He had no desire to afflict anyone with that kind of suffering — nor have it put upon him for that matter.</p>
<p>But even as the bitter thoughts ran through his head, they were chased by memories of the kind of marriage his grandparents shared — one of hard work, love, and laughter. He knew that his mother and father's marriage hasn't been a normal one.</p>
<p>Jamie snorted. ""You don't have to marry her, Ewan. Just pay more attention to her than the others so they'll give up hoin' you'll pick one of them and start lookin' at the rest of us...</p>

Belle And The Beau,['Beverly E. Jenkins'],"<h3 align=""center"">Chapter One</h3>
<p><i>April 1859</i></p>
<p><i>Whittaker, Michigan</i></p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Belle Palmer's feet burned like they were on fire. She knew the pain came from all the walking she'd been doing in the too-large boots, and that the soles of her feet were probably raw and covered with blisters, but she couldn't stop and rest. It had now been five days since slave catchers descended on their small party of Kentucky runaways, and Belle and her pa had been separated in the bedlam that followed as everyone ran for their lives. Five days of sleeping on the ground; five days of eating whatever she could find in the fields; and five days of being lost and alone. She'd come North looking for freedom and found only the freedom to starve. With no idea where she was or how to find someone she could trust, she had no choice but to keep moving. The White man who'd guided them into Michigan told them all what to look for should a disaster occur. Folks friendly to escaped slaves hung colored quilts out on their clotheslines; other houses had little Black-faced jockeys out front, and if the lantern in the jockey's hand was lit, it meant fugitives were welcomed. Belle had passed many farmhouses but had seen no such signs.</p>
<p>She'd also committed to memory the secret phrases Underground Railroad conductors sometimes asked to determine if a runaway was indeed who they claimed to be. She remembered all the corresponding answers but couldn't find anyone to ask her the questions.</p>
<p>The early April weather had turned colder last night. She pulled her threadbare coat tighter and forced back the tears filling her eyes from the agony in her feet. Her ugly, homespun trousers were nomatch for the Michigan chill and she shivered in the gray dawn air. She thought about home and what she'd be doing if she dadn't come Nor&amp; She'd be just getting up from her pallet on the floor in her mistress' room and seeing to breakfast. Belle tried not to think about food because her stomach ached with emptiness.</p>
<p>The sudden sound of wagon wheels made Belle quickly seek cover in the thick undergrowth beside the narrow dirt road. Hidden by die weeds she prayed whoever it was would drive on by. Her heart was beating so loud she just knew the sound of it could be heard back home.</p>
<p>""Hey, you boy. Come on out.""</p>
<p>The male voice froze her. She'd been seen. What should she do? Maybe if she didn't show herself the man on the wagon would think he'd only imagined seeing someone and move on.</p>
<p>""We know you're in there,"" called another voice — female this time. ""We won't hurt you:'</p>
<p>To Belle's ears, the girl sounded young.</p>
<p>""I'll bet you're hungry,"" the male voice added. ""We can get you something to eat.'</p>
<p>Belle found that offer so tempting she almost stood right then and there, but held off Suppose they were slave catchers, she asked herself Although she didn't remember hearing of any catchers that rode with young women, this was the North and maybe such things occurred here.</p>
<p>""It's going to get colder and colder today,"" the man pointed out. ""Wouldn't you rather be someplace warm?""</p>
<p>Belle wanted that too. Her nights of sleeping on the ground bad taken their toll. Her clothes were filthy, her body as well. She was tired, sore and sick to death of being lost alone in this strange land. For a few moments more she pondered his offers, then decided she didn't care if they were catchers or not, she just wanted to stop running.</p>
<p>Bolstered by the last of her courage, Belle stood to meet her fate. To her surprise, the young man and girl had brown skin just like hers. They were Colored, she saw with astonished eyes, and were more finely dressed than anyone she knew back home. The man had on a well-tailored brown suit, his female companion a simple gray cloak and matching bonnet that fit her as if it had never belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>He was walking in the brush toward her and even as Belle took a wary few steps backward, she realized hecouldn't be but a few years older than she. He was hand-some too. The dark brown skin and matching eyes were setin a face that had very pleasant features. ""I won't hurtyou, "" he assured her in a gentle voice. ""What's your name?""</p>
<p>""Belle""</p>
<p>His brown eyes assessed her dirty face beneath her battered hat, and then her filthy, ill-fitting clothes. ""That's a funny name for a boy.""</p>
<p>She almost took offense, but being tall and thin, and dressed Re a boy, she said instead, ""Yes it is, but I'm a girl.""</p>
<p>He had the decency to look chagrined. ""Sorry, miss:' He then asked, ""Are you seeking deliverance?""</p>
<p>Belle paused. It was one of the secret questions. Even though Belle knew how to respond she hesitated because the guide also warned them to be extremely cautious when approached by strangers; some folks, both Black and White preyed upon runaways for monetary gain.</p>
<p>But with nothing left to lose, Belle replied, ""Yes. Is deliverance near.</p>
<p>He assessed her for a long moment more before offering, ""Yes, it is:'</p>
<p>Belle wanted to drop to her knees and weep with joyful relief She knew he could see the sheen of tears in her eyes, but he left her dignity by not calling attention to them.</p>
<p>""My name is Daniel Best and that's my sister Josephine back there on the wagon.""</p>
<p>Belle looked out at the girl who seemed to be carefully scanning the road ahead and behind, then heard her call out, ""Come on, Dam. Bring him along before we're seen.""</p>
<p>""He's a <i>she,</i> Jo,"" her brother called back...</p>

The Savage manifesto you hold in your hands shows how Obama is circumventing the Constitution to push through his radical agenda—and, most important, how we can restore our country to the power and prestige that Barack Obama and his corrupt and degenerate ""czars"" are trying to destroy."" ""The Naked Marxist can and must be stopped. Obama's trickle up poverty is infecting all that we hold to be true and self-evident. Here's how:"" ""Impoverishing The Middle Class: Obama's confiscatory taxes, the socializing of our health-care system, and other legislative initiatives are taking away our earnings and our power to choose how we live our lives and putting it in the hands of corrupt and pro-Socialist cohorts."" ""Erasing Our Border With Mexico: The Homeland Security department that can't shoot straight is gutting the Constitution in the name of protecting illegal aliens when it should be focusing on keeping out the terrorists and drug dealers."" ""Defunding The Military And Putting Our Troops In Harm's Way: Obama's beatnik policy of taking apart our nuclear arsenal and destroying NASA, while implementing PC Rules of Engagement that don't allow our troops to protect themselves, is dangerously weakening our security and ending our military dominance."" ""Lining The Pockets Of His Wall Street Buddies: While our 401(k)'s suffer, Obama and his Wall Street heavy contributors are creating their own legislation that is driving down stock prices while allowing his biggest campaign contributors to make trillions of dollars."" ""Propagandizing The Media: Once a forum for free speech, Obama's administration has systematically overrun the media in a hostile takeover with threats and false promises that serve only to pull the wool over the sheeple's eyes."" ""Ignoring The Tea Party—the Voice Of The People: No longer a representative government, Obama is blatantly disregarding, and even suppressing, the fastest-growing collective voice in the nation right now—that of the patriotic Tea Party. His Union-Crony Purple Shirts have shown up at town-hall meetings and peaceful protests to intimidate and antagonize the democratic process.""

"Brave Men, Gentle Heroes: American Fathers And Sons In World War Ii And Vietnam",['Michael Takiff'],"<p><b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> presents the frank, moving, and harrowing stories of men who served in World War II and of their sons who served in Vietnam — fathers and sons bonded as deeply by their common experience in war as by blood.</p>
<p>These are men who served in the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps. Officers and enlisted men, career servicemen and citizen soldiers. Men of European, African, Asian, Latino, and Native American ancestry. Men who speak with the authentic voices of an Indiana farmer, a Brooklyn bus driver, a Louisiana businessman, a Seattle machinist. The contrasts between World War II and Vietnam are everywhere in these compelling accounts: the clear aims of World War II, the muddled goals of Vietnam; the heroes' welcome accorded World War II veterans, the scorn heaped upon their sons. But the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> are also rich with elements intrinsic to all wars and all soldiers: courage, honor, service, duty, youth, adventure, fear, idealism, love of country and of family, exasperation with military bureaucracy. In these pages you will find war's carnage and war's heroism, war's purpose and war's futility, war's meaning and war's tragic meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Taken together, the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> tell the history of two wars, each the defining experience of a generation. This is history told not at the level of presidents and generals, but through the recollections of men who shouldered the rifles, manned the ships, and flew the planes. We're familiar with the effects of the two wars on world politics. But what did they do to American families? Molded by the awful crucible of war, these seemingly ordinary men offer extraordinary insights into what it means to be a warrior, an American, a father, and a son.</p>
<p><b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> is a book for those who have been to war and those who have been spared its horror. It is a book for individuals to reflect upon and families to share.</p>"

<i>Discovering the Body</i> is a gripping novel filled with psychological suspense, sensitivity, and emotional complexity. With this stunning debut, Mary Howard has crafted an electrifying and hauntingly evocative novel of truth and perception, of the ties we tell others-and the lies we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>Two years ago Linda Garbo left her graphic design job in Minneapolis to open a printmaking studio in a small town in Iowa with the encouragement of Luci Cole, a weaver and an old friend from art school. Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy.</p>
<p>A beautifully crafted tour de force of significant depth, passion, and power, <i>Discovering the Body</i> is a completely beguiling meditation on perception, loss, memory, and redemption whose conclusion proves to be as significantly haunting as it is satisfying.<br>

"Clean, Sweet Wind : Sailing with the Last Boatmakers of the Carribean",['Douglas C. Pyle'],"<p>A generation ago, before waves of tourism submerged traditional ways, Douglas Pyle spent half a decade sailing his small sloop from island to island in the eastern Caribbean, seeking out native whalers, fishermen, and traders to learn how they built their boats. <i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i>, his story of that time, is as much a portrait of an island people as it is a record of their work upon the sea. In these pages we glimpse a society as vivid as the aquamarine waters of the reefs and the patched sails of graceful boats.</p><p>As he explored the family traditions of the Antillean seafarers, Pyle found himself admiring one boatbuilder in particular, Haakon Mitchell of Bequia. Mitchell had been a fisherman until an accident cost him a hand; when Pyle met him, he and his sons were building a vessel for inter-island trade. Starting first as an observer, then as a helper, Pyle finally became one of the family, working on the new sloop each day and taking meals with Mitchell and his sons. Their lifelong friendship is a central theme of <i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i>.</p><p>But this is more than a lyrical evocation of a place and time. In his years among the islands Pyle collected information on all the different boat types sailing at the time. The second half of the book is a journey from Trinidad to the Virgin Islands, with a look at each type.</p><p><i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i> captures Antillean speech, beliefs, and hospitality with as faithful an accuracy as it renders the graceful designs of Caribbean boats. The result is both a detailed study of traditional watercraft and one of the finest regional narratives yet written.</p>"

Sam Halpern, who is ""like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair,"" has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""That woman was sexy. . . . Out of your league? Son, let women figure out why they won't screw you. Don't do it for them.""</p>

Vagina: A New Biography,['Naomi Wolf'],"<p>An astonishing work of cutting-edge science and cultural history that radically reframes how we understand the vagina—and consequently, how we understand women—from one of our most respected cultural critics and thinkers, Naomi Wolf, author of the modern classic <b>The Beauty Myth</b>.</p>
<p>When an unexpected medical crisis sends Naomi Wolf on a deeply personal journey to tease out the intersections between sexuality and creativity, she discovers, much to her own astonishment, an increasing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the vagina is not merely flesh, but an intrinsic component of the female brain—and thus has a fundamental connection to female consciousness itself.</p>
<p>Utterly enthralling and totally fascinating, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> draws on this set of insights about ""the mind-vagina connection"" to reveal new information about what women really need, and considers what a sexual relationship—and a relationship to the self—transformed by these insights could look like.</p>
<p>Exhilarating and groundbreaking, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> combines rigorous science, explained for lay readers, with cultural history and deeply personal considerations of the role of female desire in female identity, creativity, and confidence, from interviewees of all walks of life. Heralded by <b>Publishers Weekly</b> as one of the best science books of the year, it is a provocative and deeply engaging book that elucidates the ties between a woman's experience of her vagina and her sense of self; her impulses, dreams, and courage; and her role in love and in society in completely new and revelatory ways sure to provoke impassioned conversation.</p>
<p>A brilliant and nuanced synthesis of physiology, history, and cultural criticism, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> explores the physical, political, and spiritual implications of this startling series of new scientific breakthroughs for women and for society as a whole, from a writer whose conviction and keen intelligence have propelled her works to the tops of bestseller lists, and firmly into the realms of modern classics.</p>"

The Washington century,['Burt Solomon'],"<p>An epic work of history ... the story of the American capital told through the lives of three families that each symbolize a different aspect of the city and the nation it embodies</p><p><b>The Washington Century</b> tells the captivating history of the nation's capital during the last century, made vivid through the struggles of three very different families, each representing an essential aspect of Washington. Veteran journalist Burt Solomon uses these families to explore everything from the customs of Washington's grand hostesses to the surge in the federal bureaucracy to the critical roles that politicking and lobbying have played as the capital has grown more truly democratic.</p><ul><li>The Boggs family came to Washington during the age of political giants. Hale Boggs, a prominent congressman from Louisiana, was the protÃ©gÃ© of Sam Rayburn and close friends with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. When Boggs died in a plane crash, he was succeeded by his widow, Lindy, a political power in her own right. Their son, Tommy Boggs, is one of the capital's most influential lobbyists, and their daughter, Cokie Roberts, is a distinguished member of the Washington press corps.</li><li>Real-estate developer Morris Cafritz changed the physical face of the city, giving form to Washington's new downtown, centered along K Street, which would become the center of activity for lobbyists and power brokers. His wife, Gwen, a legendary socialite, hosted the city's most exclusive parties, bringing together eminent politicians, jurists, and diplomats into a self-conscious elite.</li><li>Julius Hobson Sr. was a leading black activist in the first black-majority city in America. A brilliant and imaginative militant during the civil rights era, he served on D.C.'s first elected city council and fought for the capital's autonomy from the federal government before his death in 1977. His son, Julius Hobson Jr., became a political figure of a contrasting sort, an insider instead of an agitator, who worked for Mayor Marion Barry and went on to become the top lobbyist at the American Medical Association.</li></ul><p>Each family's story forms a strand of the city's single history. Their lives were entwined with those of other Washington notables - from Eleanor Roosevelt to Lady Bird Johnson, Perle Mesta, Stokely Carmichael, J. Edgar Hoover, Tip O'Neill, Jesse Jackson, John F. Kennedy, and even a twenty-six-year-old Bill Clinton.</p><p><b>The Washington Century</b> is also the behind-the-scenes biography of an intricate and ever-changing city, once a gracious capital that has become a money-driven and partisan place. Solomon's ingenious narrative, written with the pace and sense of a novel, is full of quirky moments and unforgettable characters, both familiar and unfamiliar to the American public, who made a sleepy, southern town into the soul of a nation. Compulsively readable, as enlightening as it is entertaining, here is a fascinating chapter of living history.</p>"

My Friend Michael: An Ordinary Friendship With An Extraordinary Man,['Frank Cascio'],"<p>Everyone knows Michael Jackson—the myth. This is the revealing true story of Michael Jackson—the man.</p>
<p>To Frank Cascio, Michael Jackson was many things—second father, big brother, boss, mentor, and teacher, but most of all he was a friend. Though Cascio was just a few years old when he first met Jackson in 1984, at the peak of the pop star’s career, Jackson was at the center of his life for the next twenty-five years, allowing Cascio to observe firsthand the greatest entertainer the world had ever seen. In that time, he became the ultimate Michael Jackson insider, yet remained publicly silent about his experiences. Until now.</p>
<p>In <b>My Friend Michael</b>, Cascio refutes the rumors, lies, and accusations that have accumulated over the years, providing a candid look at the Michael Jackson he knew for more than two decades. Offering an uplifting and definitive account of the legend, Cascio details how he grew up alongside Jackson, traveling the world with him on concert tours and eventually working for him. Through this lens, Cascio captures Jackson’s most private and tumultuous moments, while also setting the record straight on the entertainer’s notorious and misunderstood lifestyle—from his Peter Pan reality and his sexuality to the false allegations against him.</p>
<p>As Cascio shows, there was a great deal more to Michael Jackson than the headlines about him have suggested. Cascio reveals his friend in all his complexity, bringing to light his passions and joys as well as his flaws and eccentricities. Including stories about Jackson that have never before been made public, Cascio creates a balanced, human look at the pop star, one that shows Jackson as the very real person he was—a lively friend with an endearingly juvenile sense of humor.</p>

"The Accidental President: How 413 Lawyers, 9 Supreme Court Justices, And 5,963,110 Floridians (give Or Take A Few) Landed George W. Bush In The White House",['David A Kaplan'],"<p>For thirty-seven days after the disputed presidential election of 2000, we watched great theater, as George W Bush and Al Gore slugged it out in the swamp. You may think you've read it all before, but now <b>Newsweek's</b> David A. Kaplan goes behind the scenes of the sanctimony and machinations. In his critically acclaimed bestseller, <b>The Silicon Boys</b>, Kaplan took us inside Silicon Valley. In <b>The Accidental President</b>, he does the same for this epic moment in American history — a harmonic convergence of politics and law, media and culture.</p>
<p>With his mordant wit and incisive storytelling, Kaplan tells us how — contrary to popular belief — the Supreme Court's ruling for Bush was <b>not</b> a foregone conclusion and why the dissenting justices thought, until the last second, they could lure the one equivocating colleague they'd derisively nicknamed ""Flipper."" We're in the room when Gore decides that, more than any great lawyer, the one person he needs in Recountland is . . . Erin Brockovich. We learn which Bush partisan covertly marionetted the strings behind Katherine Harris. And we're treated to sketches of the characters they called Secret Squirrel and the Fine-Looking Man and of the political operative who jumped from a moving train.</p>
<p>Through it all — butterflies and boils; concessions, recantations, and fraternal recriminations; lawyers, more lawyers, and 181 invocations of the phrase ""uncharted waters"" — Kaplan paints a picture of an extraordinary episode for the country. There are few heroes in this tale. No person or institution comes out looking very good. ""Rule of law"" simply meant trying to figure out a way <b>around</b> the law — realpolitik by any other name.</p>
<p>The outcome of Bush versus Gore was a colossal fortuity, an election gone bad, made worse by an inconceivable coincidence of accidents. A lucky tactical call here, a confusing ballot there — amid all the folly and hypocrisy, these are what landed Bush in the White House. Different turns might have cast destiny the other way. Bush is our nation's first accidental president, just as Gore would have been. Bush may thrive or stumble in office. But either way, few will forget how he got there after November 7, 2000.</p>
<p>This is the definitive story of those thirty-seven days and why they matter.</p>"

He observes,'You canât always make your way in the world by moving up. Or down, for that matter. Boats move laterally on water, which levels everything. It is one of the two great levelers.' Part elegy, part quest, <b>Kayak Morning</b> explores Rogerâs years as a journalist, the comforts of literature, and the value of solitude, poignantly reminding us that grief is not apart from life but encompasses it. In recalling to us what we have lost, grief by necessity resurrects what we have had.</p>"

Boats With An Open Mind: Seventy-five Unconventional Designs And Concepts,['Philip C. Bolger'],"<p>Here are 75 novel and wonderful boats—some strange, some beautiful, all of them paragons of Philip Bolger's form-follows-function design philosophy. A planing microtrawler; a glass-galleried, beachable birdwatching boat; a fully enclosed ocean-cruising rowboat; cruising sailboats that take the ground at low tide; power, sail, and rowing boats from 6 to 95 feet—these are boats as only Bolger's unfettered imagination does them. This is the first collection of Bolger's work in almost 15 years. It is long overdue.</p>
<p>""Bolger is an eloquent writer and his comments run the gamut from hilarious to profound.""—<i>The Ensign</i></p>

Annulment: Your Chance To Remarry Within The Catholic Church,"['Zwack, Joseph P.']","<p>Here is the only book that explains fully in lay terms the grounds and procedures by which Roman Catholics who have undergone civil divorces can also have their former marriages annulled by the Church.</p>
<p>In the last decade alone, annulements in the United States have increased from 350 to over 30,000. At present, there are an estimated eight million divorced American Catholics, banned from full participation in the Church if the remarry without obtaining an annulment. <b>Many of these people could obtain annulments</b> — yet, until the publication of <b>Annulment,</b> the lack of proper information and guidance has discouraged the majority of them.</p>
<p>This book makes available the rights of divorce Catholics under the Revised Code of Canon Law, which is now in effect. In everyday language, this authoritative handbook takes readers step by step through the process, defines the laws as they now exist, sorts through misconceptions and fears surrounding annulment procedures, dicusses the meaning and rationale behind the rules, lays out all the grounds (including the new psychological grounds), examines all factors (including costs), defines the various apporaches, and provides samples of the forms involved.</p>
<p>The author, a lawyer himself, consulted with canon lawyers, priests, and laypeople, — some of whom have already used his manual with success.<b>Annulment</b> offers hope and solid help to the increasing number of people directly and indirectly affected by the divorce-remarriage-annulment problem. Zwack cuts cleanly through the Gordian knot of uncertainty to point the way for realistic, clear, effective solutions to this longstanding, anguished problem.</p>

Bad Boy: A Memoir,['Walter Dean Myers'],"<p>In his own words...</p>
<p>As a boy, Walter Dean Myers was quick-tempered and physically strong, always ready for a fight. He also read voraciously-he would check out books from the library and carry them home, hidden in brown paper bags in order to avoid other boys' teasing. He aspired to be a writer. But growing up in a poor family in Harlem, his hope for a successful future diminished as he came to realize fully the class and racial struggles that surrounded him. He began to doubt himself and the values that he had always relied on, attending high school less and less, turning to the streets and his books for comfort.</p>
<p>In a memoir that is gripping, funny, and ultimately unforgettable, Walter Dean Myers travels back to his roots in the magical world of Harlem during the 1940s and 1950s. Here is the story of one of the strongest voices in young people's literature today.</p>"

"The Stolen Prince: Gannibal, Adopted Son Of Peter The Great, Great-grandfather Of Alexander Pushkin, And Europe's First Black Intellectual",['Hugh Barnes'],"<p>In the spring of 1703, a young African boy stepped off a slave ship in Constantinople, the gateway between East and West. Huddling in chains, with other frightened captives, the seven-year-old claimed to be a prince of Abyssinia, a ""noble Moor"" kidnapped and stolen out of Africa. His tragedy was shared by millions of black people caught up in the Islamic slave trade, but his destiny was unique: rescued by Peter the Great, the young African became Abram Petrovich Gannibal.</p>
<p>Russia's westernizing tsar adopted the child and, in a bizarre nature-and-nurture experiment, lavished on him the best education available in the new ""European"" capital of Saint Petersburg. Gannibal, the ""Negro of Peter the Great,"" soared to dizzying heights as a soldier, diplomat, mathematician and spy. He was fêted in glittering salons, from the Winter Palace to the Louvre, and came to know Voltaire and Montesquieu, who praised him as the ""dark star of Russia's enlightenment."" At the same time, his military exploits, from northern Spain to the icy wastes of Siberia — to say nothing of his marital problems — sealed Gannibal's reputation as the Russian Othello.</p>
<p>African prince or not, the ex-slave founded a dynasty of his own in Russia, where he came to embody the strengths and weaknesses of the country itself — volatile, courageous, handsome, gifted and always astonishing. His descendants included not only Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet, but also, in England, several Mountbattens and others close to the royal family.</p>"

With his loyalties fatally divided between duty and passion, how can Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul?</p>"
Red Army: The Radical Network That Must Be Defeated to Save America,"['Aaron Klein', 'Brenda J. Elliott']","<p>In this original investigative work, the bestselling authors of <b>The Manchurian President</b> expose one of the most important untold stories of the decade: how a nexus of radical socialist groups have seized political power, shaped Obamaâs presidential agenda, and threaten the very future of our country.</p><p>For decades, a radical socialist movement has been quietly infiltrating the major institutions of American power: our schools, our military, our economy, our media, and Congress itself. This progressive Red Army is an organized network consisting of numerous specialized groups that target specific policy areas while cooperating more broadly in a concerted decades-long campaign to transform America.</p><p>Now, for the first time, investigative reporters Aaron Klein and Brenda J. Elliott not only expose the key players, organizations, and relationships in this radical network but chart their spheres of influence, their nefarious objectives, their role in shaping Barack Obamaâs agenda, and their long-term plans for the nation.</p><p>Among some of their finds, Klein and Elliott reveal the existence of a powerful 'Marxist-socialist' bloc in Congress (explicitly formed as an arm of the Democratic Socialists of America) and examine its far-reaching goals in policy areas that affect all Americans, including the complete socialization of health care and comprehensive immigration reform, which seeks to change the very nature of the American electorate. The authors expose the shocking misinformation campaign behind Obamaâs economic policies, discussing the crafting of the massive 'stimulus' legislation, as well as his plans for future economic 'reform.'</p><p>In two chapters that every American must read, entirely new information is laid bare on the leftâs unprecedented assault on our already over-liberalized education system. And in just one astonishing discovery, Klein and Elliott bring to light how federal stimulus money was used to fund an education group tied to radical educator (and unrepentant Pentagon bomber) Bill Ayers.</p><p>The authors also expose the multipronged policy offensive aimed at disarming America by emboldening our enemies within and without, spurning traditional allies, subjecting us to the authority of foreign tribunals, and systematically dismantling the U.S. military. The authors also detail how elements of the news media not only collude with these radical groups, but are in some cases members of the very same extremist organizations they ought to be investigating.</p><p>This radical network runs far deeper than the Obama administration and, if not stopped, will far outlast his presidency. From health care and manufacturing to immigration and environmental policy, <b>Red Army</b> documents how these radical groups are working to spread Americaâs wealth and transform the country into their vision of a socialist utopia.</p>"

I Am the Change: Barack Obama and the Crisis of Liberalism,['Charles R. Kesler'],"<p>Is Barack Obama the savior of liberalism-or the last liberal president? Charles R. Kesler's spirited analysis of Obama's political thought shows that he represents either a new birth of liberalism-or its demise.</p><p>Who is Barack Obama? Though many of his own supporters wonder if he really believes in anything, Charles R. Kesler argues that these disappointed liberals don't appreciate the scope of the president's ambition or the long-term stakes for which he is playing.</p><p>Conservatives also misunderstand Obama, according to this leading conservative scholar, educator, and journalist. They dismiss him as a socialist, hopelessly out of touch with the American mainstream. The fringe Right dwells on Obama's foreign upbringing, his missing birth certificate, Bill Ayers's supposed authorship of his books. What mainstream and fringe have in common is a stubborn underestimation of the man and the political movement he embodies.</p><p>Reflecting a sophisticated mix of philosophy, psychology, and history, and complemented by a scathing wit, <b>I Am the Change</b> tries to understand Obama as he understands himself, based largely on his own writings, speeches, and interviews. Kesler, the rare conservative who takes Obama seriously as a political thinker, views him as a gifted and highly intelligent progressive who is attempting to become the greatest president in the history of modern liberalism. Intent on reinvigorating the liberal faith, Obama nonetheless fails to understand its fatal contradictions-a shortsightedness that may prove to be liberalism's undoing.</p><p>Will Obama save liberalism and become its fourth great incarnation, following Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson? Or will he be derailed by his very successes? These are the questions at the heart of Kesler's thoughtful and illuminating book.</p>"

And finally it is the story of Mab, a pinkie-sized, magenta-haired, straight-talking fairy, who may or may not be real but who helps Barbie and Griffin uncover the strength beneath the pain, and who teaches that love—like a sparkling web of light spinning around our bodies and our souls—is what can heal even the deepest scars.</p>"

Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity In North Korea And The Other's Fight To Bring Her Home,"['Laura Ling', 'Lisa Ling']","<p>On March 17, 2009, Laura Ling and her colleague Euna Lee were working on a documentary about North Korean defectors who were fleeing the desperate conditions in their homeland. While filming on the Chinese–North Korean border, they were chased down by North Korean soldiers who violently apprehended them. Laura and Euna were charged with trespassing and ""hostile acts,"" and imprisoned by Kim Jong Il's notoriously secretive Communist state. Kept totally apart, they endured months of interrogations and eventually a trial before North Korea's highest court. They were the first Americans ever to be sentenced to twelve years of hard labor in a prison camp in North Korea.</p>
<p>When news of the arrest reached Laura's sister, journalist Lisa Ling, she immediately began a campaign to get her sister released, one that led her from the State Department to the higher echelons of the media world and eventually to the White House.</p>
<p><b>Somewhere Inside</b> reveals for the first time Laura's gripping account of what really happened on the river, her treatment at the hands of North Korean guards, and the deprivations and rounds of harrowing interrogations she endured. She speaks movingly about the emotional toll inflicted on her by her incarceration, including the measures she took to protect her sources and her fears that she might never see her family again.</p>
<p>Lisa writes about her unrelenting efforts to secure Laura and Euna's release. Offering insights into the vast media campaign spearheaded on the women's behalf, Lisa also takes us deep into the drama involving people at the highest levels of government, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Senator John Kerry, and Governor Bill Richardson—intense discussions that entailed strategically balancing the agendas and good intentions of the various players. She also describes her role in the back-and-forth between North Korea's demands and the dramatic rescue by former President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Though they were thousands of miles apart while Laura was in captivity, the Ling sisters' relationship became a way for the reclusive North Korean government to send messages to the United States government, which helped lead to Laura and Euna's eventual release.</p>
<p>Told in the sisters' alternating voices, <b>Somewhere Inside</b> is a timely, inspiring, and page-turning tale of survival set against the canvas of international politics that goes beyond the headlines to reveal the impact on lives engulfed by forces beyond their control. But it is also a window into the unique bond these two sisters have always shared, a bond that sustained them throughout the most horrifying ordeal of their lives.</p>"

"What Zizi Gave Honeyboy: A True Story About Love, Wisdom, And The Soul Of America",['Gerald Celente'],"<p>One recent spring Gerald Celente went to visit his cuddly eighty-three-year-old Italian aunt, Zizi, in Yonkers, New York. He was expecting the same delectable combination of food, friendship, and motherly love that Zizi had served up through the years at her little kitchen table. But Celente got more than he expected. Over chicken cutlets and games of Scrabble, the straight-talking Zizi raised some tough questions for her nephew, ""Honeyboy,"" to consider. Targeting some of the essential issues of our time-work, family, health care, politics, war, and aging in America — Zizi made Celente think about whether America was delivering on its promises. Have we lost too many timeless old-world values in the march of progress? Are we really better off today than we were yesterday? And what does the future hold for each one of us, our families, and our community as a whole?</p>
<p>Celente thought he had it all figured out. As the founder of the Trends Research Institute, he is well respected for his track record of picking business, consumer, political, and economic trends before they come to pass. It is his job to see the future and understand how the issues and events of today will determine the trends of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But it took Zizi to help him see the unsettling truths about what has happened to America over the last several decades. They would talk about the world they once knew — a world filled with family, dinners together, and Sundays at church. Zizi would remember ""back then"" with fondness, and Celente would recall his years growing up with his parents and six siblings. As they reflect on their pasts, their lives, and where we've arrived as a nation, Celente and Zizi realize that something has been lost. There is an emptiness that most of us feel. But what is the cause of it? And what can we do to fix it?</p>
<p>In <b>What Zizi Gave Honeyboy,</b> Gerald Celente provides a provocative look at our lives today and a glimpse of the future we deserve in Zizi's warmth, her recipes, and her wisdom.</p>"

<p>""Everything a yachtsman's pilot ought to be: shipshape and workmanlike in its approach, unusually well written, very thoughtfully researched. . . .

The Taliban Cricket Club: A Novel,['Timeri N. Murari'],"<p>Rukhsana is a spirited young journalist who works for the <b>Kabul Daily</b> in Afghanistan. She takes care of her ill, widowed mother and her younger brother, Jahan. But then Rukhsana is summoned to appear at the infamous Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, and their quiet and tenuous way of life is shattered.</p>
<p>There, the malevolent minister, Zorak Wahidi, announces that the Taliban has found a new way to pursue the diplomatic respect it has long been denied: cricket. On the world stage of sports, the Taliban will prove they are a fair and just society. Rukhsana and several other journalists are to report that a tournament will be held to determine who will play for Afghanistan. Anyone can put together a team. Women are forbidden to play. The winners will travel to Pakistan to train, then go on to represent Afghanistan around the world.</p>
<p>Rukhsana knows that this is a shameful, and deeply surreal, idea. The Taliban will never embrace a game rooted in civility, fairness, and equality, with no tolerance for violence or cheating. And no one in Afghanistan even knows how to play the game.</p>
<p>Except for Rukhsana.</p>
<p>This could be a way to get her cousins and her brother out of Afghanistan for good. But before she can organize a team, the terrifying Wahidi demands her hand in marriage. He finds her both exciting and infuriating, and wants to control her unruly, willful nature. The union would be her prison, stripping away what few freedoms she has left under Taliban rule and forcing her away from her family. Not marrying Wahidi, however, might mean her death. Her family rallies around her, willing to do anything to protect her, even if it means imprisonment or worse.</p>
<p>But Rukhsana realizes that Wahidi may have given her a way out, too. With the help of her loyal, beloved brother and cousins, she forms her own cricket team and sets about teaching them how to win their freedom—with a bat and a ball.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Taliban's actual and unprecedented promotion of cricket in 2000 in an attempt to gain acceptance in the global community, internationally bestselling author Murari weaves a riveting story of strength, hope, and soaring human triumph that proves no tyranny is ever absolute in the face of love.</p>"

Never To Forget: The Jews Of The Holocaust,['Milton Meltzer'],"<p>Six million— a number impossible to visualize. Six million Jews were killed in Europe between the years 1933 and 1945. What can that number mean to us today? We can that number mean to us today? We are told never to forget the Holocaust, but how can we remember something&nbsp;so incomprehensible?</p>
<p>We can think, not of the numbers, the statistics, but of the people. For the families torn apart, watching mothers, fathers, children disappear or be slaughtered, the numbers were agonizingly comprehensible. One. Two. Three. Often more. Here are the stories of thode people, recorded in letters and diaries, and in the memories of those who survived. Seen through their eyes, the horror becomes real. We cannot deny it—and we can never forget.</p>

Charlotte's Web (trophy Newbery),['E. B. White'],"<p>Sixty years ago, on October 15, 1952, E.B. White's <i>Charlotte's Web</i> was published. It's gone on to become one of the most beloved children's books of all time. To celebrate this milestone, the renowned Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo has written a heartfelt and poignant tribute to the book that is itself a beautiful translation of White's own view of the world—of the joy he took in the change of seasons, in farm life, in the miracles of life and death, and, in short, the glory of everything.</p>
<p>We are proud to include Kate DiCamillo's foreword in the 60th anniversary editions of this cherished classic.</p>
<p><i>Charlotte's Web</i> is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilbur—and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn.</p>
<p>With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and by a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to quite a pig.</p>
<p>How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language.</p>
<p>The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.</p>


                        <p>Wilbur the pig is desolate when he discovers that he is destined to be the farmer's Christmas dinner until his spider friend, Charlotte decides to help him.

The Concise Encyclopedia Of The Ethics Of New Technologies,"['Chadwick, Ruth F.']","<p>The ethical assessment of new technologies raises two principal concerns: the need to develop effective policies and legislation, and the reconsideration of the ethical frameworks in which these policies and laws are developed.

Handbook Of Psychological Assessment (pergamon General Psychology Series),"['Michel Hersen', 'Gerald Goldstein']","<p>The field of psychological assessment has been undergoing rapid change. The second edition of this Handbook, published in 1990, appeared at the beginning of a decade marked by extensive advances in assessment in essentially all of its specialized areas. There are many new tests, new applications of established tests, and new test systems. Major revisions have appeared of established tests, notably the Wechsler intelligence scales. The time seemed right for a third edition, since even over the relatively brief period of ten years, many tests described in the second edition have been replaced, and are no longer commonly used. Furthermore, much new research in such areas as neuropsychology, cognitive science, and psychopathology have made major impacts on how many tests and other assessment procedures are used and interpreted. This third edition represents an effort to give the reader an overview of the many new developments in assessment, while still maintaining material on basic psychometric concepts in order for it to continue to serve as a comprehensive handbook for the student and professional.<br>

I'm Your Man: The Life Of Leonard Cohen,['Sylvie Simmons'],"<p>The legend behind such songs as “Suzanne,” “Bird on the Wire” and “Hallelujah” andthe poet and novelist behind such groundbreaking literary works as <em>Beautiful Losers</em> and <em>Book of Mercy</em>, Leonard Cohen is one of the most important and influential artists of our era, a man of powerful emotion and intelligence whose work has explored the definitive issues of human life—sex, religion, power, meaning, love. Cohen is also a man of complexities and seeming contradictions: a devout Jew, who is also a sophisticate and ladies’ man, as well as an ordained Buddhist monk whose name, Jikan—“ordinary silence”—is quite the appellation for a writer and singer whose life has been anything but ordinary.</p>
<p><em>I’m Your Man</em> is the definitive account of that extraordinary life. Acclaimed music journalist Sylvie Simmons crafts a portrait of Cohen as nuanced as the man himself, drawing on a wealth of research that includes Cohen’s personal archives and more than a hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to Cohen—from his lovers, friends, monks, professors, rabbis and fellow musicians to his muses, including Rebecca De Mornay, Marianne Ihlen, Suzanne Elrod and Suzanne Verdal—and most important, with Cohen himself, whose presence infuses these pages.</p>
<p>Starting in Montreal, Cohen’s birthplace, where he first found fame as a poet in the fifties, Simmons follows his trail, via London and the Greek island of Hydra, to New York in the sixties, where he launched his music career. From there she traces the arc of his prodigious achievements to his remarkable retreat in the mid-nineties—when on the cusp of marriage to a beautiful actress and enjoying the success of his best-selling album to date, he entered a monastery on a rocky mountaintop above Los Angeles—and finally to his reemergence for a sold-out world tour almost fifteen years later. Whether navigating Cohen’s journeys through the back streets of Mumbai or the countless hotel rooms where he has stayed along the way, Simmons explores with equal focus every complex, contradictory strand of Cohen’s life—from the halls of academia to the arenas of rock ’n’ roll—and presents a deeply insightful portrait of both the artist and the man whose vision, spirit, depth and talent continue to move people like no one else.</p>"

"Buy, Lie, And Sell High: How Investors Lost Out On Enron And The Internet Bubble","['D. Quinn Mills', 'Daniel Quinn Mills']","<p>Why did the Internet and Enron stock collapses really happen? Was it arrogance? Greed? The ""madness of crowds""? Just plain bad luck? Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>In <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i>, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills offers the first systematic analysis of both the Internet stock bubble and the Enron scandal. Drawing upon new research-including an extensive review of the latest lawsuits and securities documents-Mills uncovers both systemic causes and outrageous misbehavior. He demonstrates how each link in the ""financial value chain,"" from venture funds to auditors and regulators, not only failed to protect small investors, but also actively contributed to their losses.</p>
<p>Mills demonstrates why it didn't have to be that way, comparing the U.S. experience with that of Germany, which experienced its own Internet stock bubble with far milder consequences to ordinary investors. He then offers practical and detailed recommendations for investors, citizens, and policymakers seeking to keep it from happening again.</p>
<p>Includes exclusive interviews with and contributions by:</p>

<p>The Internet bubble: What really happened—and why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse</li>
<li>Why the Internet stock collapse was no accident</li>
<li>Who lost—and who benefited</li>
<li>How the disaster could have been averted</li>
<li>Avoiding the next speculative bubble: techniques for investors, recommendations for policymakers</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors lost millions of dollars in the Internet collapse—and, according to conventional wisdom, they only have themselves to blame for being greedy, shortsighted, and ignorant of business fundamentals. But is that the real story? In this riveting and insightful book, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills argues that the Internet bubble and subsequent collapse was no accident: Blame can be placed squarely at the feet of venture firms, investment banks, accountants, mutual funds, brokerages, federal regulators, and the Federal Reserve—not ""dumb small investors."" Through extensive original research and the contributions of many active participants, <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i> offers authoritative answers to the questions every investor is asking: ""What actually happened during the Internet bubble?"" ""Who got the money I lost?"" ""Why did it happen?"" ""Who's to blame?"" ""What can I do about it?"" ""Will it happen again, and how can I keep it from happening to me?""</p>
<p>Mills compares the U.S. Internet bubble with events in Germany, where an Internet bubble also arose—but with radically different and far less serious consequences. Drawing on the same ideas, he also offers the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse. Then Mills presents a specific, rigorous analytical structure for helping investors avoid future bubbles—as well as the first detailed proposals for effective reform.</p>

Devlin's Boatbuilding: How To Build Any Boat The Stitch-and-glue Way,['Samual Devlin'],"<p>Why is stitch-and-glue boatbuilding so popular?</p>
<p>Any number of construction methods will produce a beautiful boat. But for the backyard builder with limited experience and a tight budget, the choice is not so complicated. Traditional plank-on-frame and cold-molded construction require complicated lofting and building molds—to say nothing of expensive tooling and lots of time. Stitch-and-glue construction, on the other hand, can produce the same results with a substantial savings in time and money. The process is quicker, easier, uses fewer parts, and produces a boat that is much easier to maintain—without the building molds and with only the simplest lofting. For tools, you need little more than a circular saw, a sander/polisher/grinder, a block plane, a framing square, a level, and a tape measure.</p>
<p>Sam Devlin has elevated stitch-and-glue boatbuilding to an artform, and his graceful designs have attracted the attention of backyard builders across the country. Here is all you need to know to build the boat of your dreams, whether it's a 7-foot dinghy or a 40-foot power cruiser. <i>Devlin's Boatbuilding: How to Build Any Boat the Stitch-and-Glue Way</i> shares the wisdom of his 16 years of experience designing, building, and helping others build his fleet of small sail- and powerboats.</p>
<p>It's all here, from choosing a design and setting up shop to painting the finished hull and launching. There is also a gallery of Devlin's designs and a detailed appendix listing sources for tools and other materials.</p>"

Inversions: A Catalog Of Calligraphic Cartwheels,"['Kim, Scott.']","Backword by Jef Raskin
<p>""Inversions"" are words that read the same upside down or in a mirror. Or words cleverly hidden inside other words. Each has something to fool the eye, a special visual trick; at the same time the words Kim has chosen to illustrate in this imaginative catalog of challenging visual wordplay reflect the idea of symmetry, both in art and in science.</p>
<p>Sixty pages of images portray short and long words, words describing symmetries, variations on Gödel, Escher, Bach and on calligraphic themes, and contemporary, historical, and personal names. They are followed by an illustrated text that explores the skills that go into making inversions: symmetry, vision, and letterforms; processes and examples; and associations with music, wordplay, and art. The book is designed so that the text is also symmetrical - what is said in the lefthand column of a page frequently matches the meaning of what is said in the righthand column.</p>

Heliopolis,['James Scudamore'],"Born in a São Paulo shantytown, Ludo undergoes a remarkable transformation from one side of the city's impermeable social divide to the other. Rescued and raised by a plutocrat, Zeno Generoso, Ludo finds himself entrenched in the gated, guarded community of the super-rich.
<p>Now twenty-seven, Ludo works for a vacuous ""communications company"" that markets unwanted, unaffordable products aimed at the very underclass into which he was born and from which he escaped.

<p>Ludo's involvement in an ill-conceived supermarket launch aimed at the favela's desperately poor population risks embroiling him in a world of violence and brutality.

Our Fathers' Wells: A Personal Encounter With The Myths Of Genesis,['Peter Pitzele'],"Born of thoroughly assimilated Jewish parents, Peter Pitzele journeys back from his various odysseys in alternative faiths to search out the roots of his own birthright. In discovering and claiming just what that means to him, he plants his focus firmly in the biblical book of Genesis. Here he finds the first articulation of those mythic paradigms that will form in time the legacy of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Here are ""the fathers' wells,"" the deep and difficult source texts for our imagination of God. Pitzele's approach to Genesis is personal and pluralistic. He reads not only with a detailed knowledge of the tales, but with the imagination of a psychodramatist. Scripture for him is full of dramatic possibility and psychological truth. The great cast of archetypal figures - Adam, Eve, Cain, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph - are given a fuller dimension in his rendering of their stories. Woven throughout are slices of Pitzele's own personal history, demonstrating the relationship between myth and experience, between the profound images of the Western spiritual tradition and the life of a man who wrestles with his roles as father, husband, son, and brother. In the spirit of conservation, Pitzele seeks to clarify the wells of our spiritual inheritance. His journey of exploration and self-discovery has an immediacy for any of us grappling to find meaning and relevance in the gifts of the past. His purpose is not merely to retell but to re-animate our foundational stories and to bring them to bear on our own lives."

Turn Off The Hunger Switch: Reset Your Brain To Change Your Weight,['Paul Rivas'],"Do you have a weakness for sweets? Do you feel hungry all the time? Do you eat when you're feeling sad? Do you eat just for the sake of eating? If you do, you do not have an eating problem. You have a brain chemistry problem -- a glitch in your hunger switch. In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, diet specialist Paul Rivas, M.D., shows how the excessive hunger that creates weight gain is a direct result of erroneous brain chemistry messages which turn on your hunger switch. Turn it off, and your hunger -- and weight problem -- disappears. Dr. Rivas's revoltionary no-diet, no-exercise plan places you into one of the following types: You are a type ""N"" with a norepinephrine deficiency if: You feel tired frequently and blame your fatigue for your weight. Your weight climbs for no apparent reason. You are a type ""S"" with a serotonin deficiency if: You crave chocolate. You eat out of boredom. You eat large quantities of food at one sitting. You are a type ""D"" with a dopamine deficiency if: You continue to crave salt or sweets even after various medications have been tried; You are easily distracted. You are a type ""C"" with a carbohydrate sensitivity if: You can't lose weight even if you have excellent appetite control; Low-calorie diets don't work; You strongly crave mainly carbohydrates like pasta and bread.
<p> In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, Dr. Rivas leads you on the discovery of your personal hunger buttons and shows you the methods by which you can turn them on and off at will. Ninety percent of Dr. Rivas' 10,000 patients have successfully lost weight and maintained their weight loss for years by following his unique plan which uses safe, well-tested, doctor-prescribed medications, nutrients, or natural supplements to bring hunger and cravings under immediate control. And it really is as easy as flicking a switch.</p>"

Harper Collins Publishers Annos Counting Book (set Of 12),['Mitsumasa Anno'],"Every child is a natural mathematician, according to Mitsumasa Anno. Children start to count long before they learn their ABC's, for they are constantly comparing and classifying things and events they observe around them. As they try to bring sense and order into what they observe, they are actually performing basic mathematical feats.
<p>In this book, Mitsumasa Anno, the creator of the brilliantly inventive Anno's Alphabet, invites young readers on another stimulating adventure of the imagination-this time into the world of numbers and counting. Gentle watercolor pictures show a landscape changing through the various times of day and the turning seasons, months and years, and the activities of the people and animals who come to live there. But the seemingly simple plan of the book is deceptive: look more carefully and you will see one-to-one correspondences; groups and sets; scales and tabulations; changes over time periods; and many other mathematical relationships as they occur in natural, everyday living. Just as our forebears developed our number system from observing the order of nature, the reader is subtly led to see and understand the real meaning of numbers.</p>
<p>Look at this book and look again. Each time you do so, you will find another application of a natural mathematical concept that you had not noticed before.</p>

<p>As Haverleigh is secured through their labor and collusion, sparks fly between Gwyneth and her thief. In a moment of rash indiscretion, a kiss nearly undoes them both. Love between a lady and a thief is unthinkable...unless the truth can remain hidden.</p>"

In December 1994, Orange County became the largest municipality in U.S. history to become bankrupt. By borrowing heavily and placing the wrong bets, Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron lost $1.7 billion of Orange County's $7.4 billion investment portfolio.<br>
<b>Big Bets Gone Bad: Derivatives and Bankruptcy in Orange County</b> is the first detailed description of the Orange County bankruptcy. Author Philippe Jorion, the only professor in Orange County who teaches and researches derivatives, is uniquely placed to understand the technical details of the portfolio and climate in the Orange County municipal government that encouraged the decisions that led to the bankruptcy.<br>

All In The Same Boat: Family Living Aboard And Cruising,['Tom Neale'],"In 1979 the Neales left their law and education careers and traded their home in a suburban neighborhood for a three-room boat. Now, their neighborhood is a Chesapeake Bay cove, or a secluded Bahamian beach, or anywhere else they choose to anchor. And along the way they raised two daughters. All in the Same Boat is one family's testament to the belief that you can lead your own life, whatever that might be. For the Neales, it hasn't been a vacation. Instead of mowing the lawn, they fix the watermaker or make bread from scratch; instead of trying to find good schools for the kids, they make their own good school; instead of living to work, they work to live, making time for adventure and play. Here is how they do it, and how you can do it too, with hard-won tips, practical suggestions, and life lessons on everything from developing a cruising frame of mind to choosing and customizing the right boat to dealing calmly with the myriad problems, big and small, that will ship with you on your journey."
Whitefish Can't Jump: And Other Tales Of Gamefish On The Fly,['E. Donnall Thomas'],"In his Preface to Whitefish Can't Jump, Don Thomas writes: ""A space alien arriving on the Big Hole during the middle of the salmon-fly hatch might conclude that the same sport an earlier writer had trouble distinguishing from religion is really about entomology, fashionable outdoor wear, and power, all of which is wrong. Above all else, fly-fishing is about fish and the places they are found."" Here, then, are nineteen fly-fishing stories refreshingly devoid of Latin, pink shirts, and angling glitterati - stories where the fish and the places they are found unabashedly occupy center stage. On the flats of Christmas Island, the fusion of Fin-Nor and bonefish becomes only the second lifetime experience to live up to its advance billing. On a river in southwestern Alaska, boating a huge rainbow where no huge rainbow should be becomes more important than avoiding a midstream collision with a nine-foot grizzly. A Montreal gas-station attendant's tip leads to a far-northern pond and a harrowing encounter with The Ultimate Northern Pike. The quixotic quest for a permit on a fly in Belize is marred only slightly by a dissolving marriage and a Blue Crab Special impaled in a philosophical guide's ear. In Siberia, Dolly Varden, vodka, and the novelty of Catch-and-Release combine to thaw the cold war. And in the Yellowstone River, a new season begins with Rocky Mountain Whitefish and the reminder of just how arbitrary the distinction between gamefish and just-plain-fish can be. And why it ultimately doesn't matter. From each story we learn a little about fishing, a lot about fish, and a thing or two about life - or at least the kind of life where time spent on the water with fly rod in hand is infinitely more important than time spent anywhere else.

                        <p>In these nineteen lyrical stories, E. Donnall Thomas, Jr., presents an absorbing celebration of the fly-fishing lifestyle. From Alaska, to Christmas Island, to the Ultimate Northern Pike, to Yellowstone and other locales, we discover in these stories a little about fishing and a lot about life.

And what was Edmond Halley, of comet fame, doing as Captain of a King's Ship and later spy for the Crown?

Structures Of Our Time: 31 Buildings That Changed Modern Life,['Roger Shepherd'],"Structures of Our Time celebrates the power of architecture to touch us all with unprecedented in-depth portraits of the 31 winners of AIA's prestigious annual prize, which acknowledges a structure whose significance has stood the test of a quarter century of time.
<p>From Fifth Avenue-shaping Rockefeller Center, the first AIA honoree in 1969, to Richard Meier's Darien, Connecticut, Smith House, created in 1965 to 1967 and winner of the year 2000 prize, this book investigates the structures that mark and define our era.</p>
<p>In the company of their architects and admirers, users and bystanders, clients and critics, Structures of our Time probes innovations and influence. Each portrait of a prizewinner reveals new aspects of the meaning of structures -- from the feelings and perceptions of inhabitants to reverberations through community and culture, to architects' memories of projects' conceptions, to how the creators regard their works today.</p>
<p>In Structures of Our Time, you'll explore the ways architecture gives identity, shape, and pleasure to communities. You'll witness the birth of important new forms and innovations: the garden city; the corporate campus; environmental design; the glass box; the house redefined; the sublime intersection of beauty and technology.</p>
<p>Through this scrutiny, this book raises the central questions of architecture: What makes a building great? How do structures affect the lives around them? Beyond the physical, what in architecture endures?</p>
<p>Featuring work by immortals such as Frank Lloyd Wright; Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill; Louis Kahn; Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; Eero Saarinen; and Charles and Ray Eames, Structures of Our Time takes you behind the drawing boards where historic breakthroughs first appeared. With each turn of the page, you enter more deeply into the minds of the greatest architectural thinkers of our time, exploring creations whose reach encompassed art and penetrated culture.</p>
<p> With beautiful graphic design, original drawings and renderings never before publicly available, and superb production values supervised by Architectural Record, this book on the most influential of buildings is certain to exert its own influence. To open this book is to make discovery after discovery. To own it is to have a lifetime of insight and inspiration always at hand.</p>"

"Surface Activity: Principles, Phenomena And Applications (polymers, Interfaces And Biomaterials)",['Kaoru Tsujii'],"Surfaces and interfaces are concepts of fundamental importance in materials science and technology. All materials have surfaces. When two or more materials are put together, interfaces appear. In composite materials, interfaces play a crucial role in determining mechanical, optical, and electronic properties.<br>
<br>
Surfaces and interfaces can be dramatically altered when surfactant molecules are applied to them, modifying not only the interactions between two materials at the interface, but also the bulk properties of a composite. Surfactants are key materials in processes involving adhesion, coating, mixing, domain formations, and many other phenomena in the medical, pharmaceutical, chemical, and electronic industries.<br>
<br>
Surfactants exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena such as formations of micelles, vesicles, layers, and gels. They provide a fascinating example of self-assembly. Surfactants have many phases and undergo phase transitions between them. Understanding these phenomena is a great challenge for physics and chemistry, and is of increasing technological importance.<br>
<br>
Dr. Kaoru Tsujii is one of the pioneers and leaders in the science and technology of surfactants. He has long expolored the field, both in theory and in industrial applications, and seeks to demonstrate applications of surfactants in our everyday life and industry. The book will serve as an excellent text and reference for researchers and students who wish to know more about surfactants.

                        <p><b>Audience:</b> Researchers, engineers, professors, and graduate students in materials science (polymers) fields, chemical engineering, chemistry, and pharmacology.

Everybody Had His Own Gringo: The Cia And The Contras,['Glenn Garvin'],"The Reagan administration spent eight years and a quarter of a billion dollars backing the contras in their bid to overthrow the Sandinistas. By the time the Sandinistas were defeated in a general election they themselves had called, the contras were virtually forgotten. The contras had won, but there were no ticker-tape parades. Most people - even those the contras had swept into power - just wanted to forget them. And now, after trying to make the peace work, they are back in the hills rearming. The story of the contras and their strange relationship with their CIA sponsors is one of courage, political intrigue, and general craziness. Pulitzer nominee Glenn Garvin took notes."

Pilate: The Diary Of An Invented Man,['Ann Wroe'],"Very little is known for certain about Pontius Pilate, the man who crucified Christ, but this has not stopped writers in every age from imagining his life. In this extraordinary book, Ann Wroe recounts the lives of all our Pilates, among them the glittering medieval tyrant devoted to gambling; the early-Christian intellectual; the beleaguered Victorian administrator; the Coptic saint, martyred on the cross; the Alpine devil, in league with Satan to claim the souls of mountain climbers; and the wriggling modern pragmatist, whose dilemma over Jesus has been described by Tony Blair as ""a timeless parable of political life.""<br>
<br>
This is also the story, as far as it can be reconstructed from archaeology and from classical sources, of the real Pilate: his likely background, his career, his duties, his failings, his fears, and the attitude he might have had to the various forms of thinking he encountered in Judea. Ann Wroe shows how, in his struggles with fate and free will, Pilate's story has also become the story of ourselves."

The Force Of The Past: A Novel,"['Sandro Veronesi', 'Alastair Mcewen']","What do we know about our parents — <br>
their true ideals, beliefs, and dreams?<br>
How can we be certain? 
<p>Shortly after his father's death, Gianni Orzan reaches the disturbing conclusion that his father did not love him. Aloof and dismissive, Maurizio Orzan seldom had anything to say to his son. Moreover, he was a staunch fascist.</p>
<p>Or so Gianni thought. Then comes the day he's contacted by a complete stranger who has a disquieting familiarity with his life. In what amounts to kidnapping, the stranger pursues an urgent mission: to convince Gianni that the father he knew was an illusion; that Maurizio was, in fact, a double agent for the KGB.</p>
<p>What is Gianni to believe? If this stranger's revelations are true, they threaten to destroy Gianni's steadfast beliefs about his father's shameful, self-created identity and promise to send his life crashing down around him.</p>
<p>Narrated with deft wit and subtle reflection, <i>The Force of the Past</i> — winner of Italy's Viareggio-Repaci Prize and the Premio Campiello and a finalist for the Zerilli-Marimò prize — is an insightful look at how one son tries to comprehend his father's mysterious complexities, as well as a provocative, ironic examination of how men construct their own subjective versions of reality.</p>

Veerappan: India's Most Wanted Man,['Sunaad Raghuram'],"""Veerappan: poacher, smuggler, killer - a fugitive who for more than three decades has sustained a crime frenzy as action packed and outlandish as anything Hollywood (or even Bollywood) could conjure."" ""Determined to escape the crushing poverty of his childhood village, Veerappan was lured to a life of crime in his adolescence and eventually amassed a gang with as many as 150 members. He has kidnapped wealthy men, poached precious resources, and viciously ambushed police, killing more than a hundred. He stole such great quantities of explosives from nearby granite operations that the government ordered the industry to shut down. Yet to this day he has eluded capture, despite the government's creation of a special task force, the sole purpose of which is to stop him."" ""The impenetrable Indian jungle provides him with shelter and refuge, while villagers, whether from fear or admiration, protect him from the police, so that year after year he has grown bolder and more power hungry. His most audacious act to date - the kidnapping of India's biggest film star - caused nationwide public upheaval and brought the film industry to a halt, while his demands for ransom presented the government with a crippling legal dilemma."" Investigative journalist Sunaad Raghuram's researched report follows Veerappan's violent progression from a small-time poacher to the bloodthirsty criminal who has flouted the entire Indian police force and government for decades. Using the personal testimony of Veerappan's family members and closest associates, Raghuram recounts this outlaw's crimes and examines his personal life as well, including a surprisingly touching first person account of what Veerappan's wife has endured. Veerappan: India's Most Wanted Man details the methods and madness of a man alternately hailed as a messiah and condemned as a murderer."

Anna And The Duke,['Kathryn Smith'],"<h3 align=""center"">Chapter One</h3>
<i>Scotland, 1818</i>
<p>""Why don't you just pick one, then?""</p>
<p>Standing waist deep in the chilly waters of Loch Glenshea, Ewan MacLaughlin slicked his wet hair back from his face and stared dumbly at his cousin Jamie. ""Pick one what?""</p>
<p>With a sigh and an expression of exasperation, Jamie jerked his head in the direction of the shore. ""One of them.""</p>
<p>A crowd of girls from the village had gathered to watch the boys swim. Some of the girls were trying to goad the others into joining them, for the day was sunny and hot and they'd all been working since sunrise. None of the girls was actually brazen enough to wade in, however.</p>
<p>Ewan scoffed as the sound of giggling drifted across the water. ""What would I want to pick one of them for?""</p>
<p>Jamie scowled, drawing his dark auburn eyebrows together. ""Are ye daft as well as stubborn? So the rest of us might actually have a chance of choosing one as well!""</p>
<p>Ewan truly had no idea what his cousin was talking about, and he was certain he was neither stupid nor stubborn, but as he studied the girls on the shore he noticed that most of them were watching him. An uncomfortable realization settled in his chest. He'd never thought of himself as much of a catch before, but as an eligible, landowning young man of twenty-four, he realized that he was definitely seen as a catch.</p>
<p>I don't want one!"" he blurted with absolute certainty, his heart pounding in his chest. The idea of spending the rest of his life with one of those girls — any girl-filled him with dread.</p>
<p>Wanting to put a stop to this ridiculous conversation, he dove under the surface of the loch, each powerful stroke ofhis arms taking him farther away from his cousin and his absurd questions.</p>
<p>Him, a husband? The very thought filled him with horror. While many of the girls of his village were bonny to be sure, there was not one who caught his interest more than the others. Not one that set his heart pounding or made his palms damp. He couldn't imagine spending the rest of his life with a single one of them. What would they have in common? And what would they think of a husband who sometimes stayed up half the night reading or painting? A sensible Scottish lass would think him as daft as Jamie seemed to think him.</p>
<p>Lungs close to bursting, Ewan broke the surface of the lake, only to find Jamie coming up behind him, his long chestnut hair trailing like seaweed behind him. His cousin's fair skin had finally started to tan rather than burn, but he was still several shades lighter than Ewan. Jamie's complexion was the only delicate thing about him. He was pure Scot through and through-as strong as an ox and just as stubborn as one too. He had to be. It was the only way his family had survived The Clearances. They'd been kicked off their land by the wealthy landowners, and Jamie came to his cousin Ewan looking for work to support his family-and work he did. It was Ewan, the lord of the land, who wasn't a true Scot. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't change the fact that English blood also ran in his veins.</p>
<p>""What do you mean you don't want one?"" Jamie demanded, treading water beside him. ""You'll not find a more bonny lot anywhere-not even in the court of King George himself."" The statement wasn't meant to be insulting, of that Ewan was certain, but it stung all the same.</p>
<p>Ewan averted his gaze so his cousin couldn't see the guilt there. He was certain it was his father's blood — <i>English</i> blood-that made him want to taste the world beyond his tiny village of Lodi Glenshea, beyond Hadrian!s wall to the southern lands of England. He had no good reason to feel such a pull toward his father's homeland. In fact, he resisted it violently. His father had deserted Ewan and his mother years ago, leaving his mother to waste away and eventually die broken and in much lowered circumstances. Ewan had been very young, but memories of his mother were burned into his mind.</p>
<p>Ewan's one memory of him was of his father leaving after his mother's funeral. It was fuzzy, for he'd been just a wee lad of three. At the time, Ewan was glad to stay in Scotland with people he knew, but as he grew older he wondered why his father hadn't taken him with him, why he had left his son to struggle to keep his home standing and his people prosperous. He also wondered why he still thought about his father after all these years. He deserved none of Ewan's curiosity. He certainly didn't deserve the small bit of his son's heart that still ached at the thought of his father not wanting him.</p>
<p>""I have no desire to take a wife, Jamie:' he replied softly. He'd seen what marriage had done to his mother. He had no desire to afflict anyone with that kind of suffering — nor have it put upon him for that matter.</p>
<p>But even as the bitter thoughts ran through his head, they were chased by memories of the kind of marriage his grandparents shared — one of hard work, love, and laughter. He knew that his mother and father's marriage hasn't been a normal one.</p>
<p>Jamie snorted. ""You don't have to marry her, Ewan. Just pay more attention to her than the others so they'll give up hoin' you'll pick one of them and start lookin' at the rest of us...</p>

Belle And The Beau,['Beverly E. Jenkins'],"<h3 align=""center"">Chapter One</h3>
<p><i>April 1859</i></p>
<p><i>Whittaker, Michigan</i></p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Belle Palmer's feet burned like they were on fire. She knew the pain came from all the walking she'd been doing in the too-large boots, and that the soles of her feet were probably raw and covered with blisters, but she couldn't stop and rest. It had now been five days since slave catchers descended on their small party of Kentucky runaways, and Belle and her pa had been separated in the bedlam that followed as everyone ran for their lives. Five days of sleeping on the ground; five days of eating whatever she could find in the fields; and five days of being lost and alone. She'd come North looking for freedom and found only the freedom to starve. With no idea where she was or how to find someone she could trust, she had no choice but to keep moving. The White man who'd guided them into Michigan told them all what to look for should a disaster occur. Folks friendly to escaped slaves hung colored quilts out on their clotheslines; other houses had little Black-faced jockeys out front, and if the lantern in the jockey's hand was lit, it meant fugitives were welcomed. Belle had passed many farmhouses but had seen no such signs.</p>
<p>She'd also committed to memory the secret phrases Underground Railroad conductors sometimes asked to determine if a runaway was indeed who they claimed to be. She remembered all the corresponding answers but couldn't find anyone to ask her the questions.</p>
<p>The early April weather had turned colder last night. She pulled her threadbare coat tighter and forced back the tears filling her eyes from the agony in her feet. Her ugly, homespun trousers were nomatch for the Michigan chill and she shivered in the gray dawn air. She thought about home and what she'd be doing if she dadn't come Nor&amp; She'd be just getting up from her pallet on the floor in her mistress' room and seeing to breakfast. Belle tried not to think about food because her stomach ached with emptiness.</p>
<p>The sudden sound of wagon wheels made Belle quickly seek cover in the thick undergrowth beside the narrow dirt road. Hidden by die weeds she prayed whoever it was would drive on by. Her heart was beating so loud she just knew the sound of it could be heard back home.</p>
<p>""Hey, you boy. Come on out.""</p>
<p>The male voice froze her. She'd been seen. What should she do? Maybe if she didn't show herself the man on the wagon would think he'd only imagined seeing someone and move on.</p>
<p>""We know you're in there,"" called another voice — female this time. ""We won't hurt you:'</p>
<p>To Belle's ears, the girl sounded young.</p>
<p>""I'll bet you're hungry,"" the male voice added. ""We can get you something to eat.'</p>
<p>Belle found that offer so tempting she almost stood right then and there, but held off Suppose they were slave catchers, she asked herself Although she didn't remember hearing of any catchers that rode with young women, this was the North and maybe such things occurred here.</p>
<p>""It's going to get colder and colder today,"" the man pointed out. ""Wouldn't you rather be someplace warm?""</p>
<p>Belle wanted that too. Her nights of sleeping on the ground bad taken their toll. Her clothes were filthy, her body as well. She was tired, sore and sick to death of being lost alone in this strange land. For a few moments more she pondered his offers, then decided she didn't care if they were catchers or not, she just wanted to stop running.</p>
<p>Bolstered by the last of her courage, Belle stood to meet her fate. To her surprise, the young man and girl had brown skin just like hers. They were Colored, she saw with astonished eyes, and were more finely dressed than anyone she knew back home. The man had on a well-tailored brown suit, his female companion a simple gray cloak and matching bonnet that fit her as if it had never belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>He was walking in the brush toward her and even as Belle took a wary few steps backward, she realized hecouldn't be but a few years older than she. He was hand-some too. The dark brown skin and matching eyes were setin a face that had very pleasant features. ""I won't hurtyou, "" he assured her in a gentle voice. ""What's your name?""</p>
<p>""Belle""</p>
<p>His brown eyes assessed her dirty face beneath her battered hat, and then her filthy, ill-fitting clothes. ""That's a funny name for a boy.""</p>
<p>She almost took offense, but being tall and thin, and dressed Re a boy, she said instead, ""Yes it is, but I'm a girl.""</p>
<p>He had the decency to look chagrined. ""Sorry, miss:' He then asked, ""Are you seeking deliverance?""</p>
<p>Belle paused. It was one of the secret questions. Even though Belle knew how to respond she hesitated because the guide also warned them to be extremely cautious when approached by strangers; some folks, both Black and White preyed upon runaways for monetary gain.</p>
<p>But with nothing left to lose, Belle replied, ""Yes. Is deliverance near.</p>
<p>He assessed her for a long moment more before offering, ""Yes, it is:'</p>
<p>Belle wanted to drop to her knees and weep with joyful relief She knew he could see the sheen of tears in her eyes, but he left her dignity by not calling attention to them.</p>
<p>""My name is Daniel Best and that's my sister Josephine back there on the wagon.""</p>
<p>Belle looked out at the girl who seemed to be carefully scanning the road ahead and behind, then heard her call out, ""Come on, Dam. Bring him along before we're seen.""</p>
<p>""He's a <i>she,</i> Jo,"" her brother called back...</p>

The Savage manifesto you hold in your hands shows how Obama is circumventing the Constitution to push through his radical agenda—and, most important, how we can restore our country to the power and prestige that Barack Obama and his corrupt and degenerate ""czars"" are trying to destroy."" ""The Naked Marxist can and must be stopped. Obama's trickle up poverty is infecting all that we hold to be true and self-evident. Here's how:"" ""Impoverishing The Middle Class: Obama's confiscatory taxes, the socializing of our health-care system, and other legislative initiatives are taking away our earnings and our power to choose how we live our lives and putting it in the hands of corrupt and pro-Socialist cohorts."" ""Erasing Our Border With Mexico: The Homeland Security department that can't shoot straight is gutting the Constitution in the name of protecting illegal aliens when it should be focusing on keeping out the terrorists and drug dealers."" ""Defunding The Military And Putting Our Troops In Harm's Way: Obama's beatnik policy of taking apart our nuclear arsenal and destroying NASA, while implementing PC Rules of Engagement that don't allow our troops to protect themselves, is dangerously weakening our security and ending our military dominance."" ""Lining The Pockets Of His Wall Street Buddies: While our 401(k)'s suffer, Obama and his Wall Street heavy contributors are creating their own legislation that is driving down stock prices while allowing his biggest campaign contributors to make trillions of dollars."" ""Propagandizing The Media: Once a forum for free speech, Obama's administration has systematically overrun the media in a hostile takeover with threats and false promises that serve only to pull the wool over the sheeple's eyes."" ""Ignoring The Tea Party—the Voice Of The People: No longer a representative government, Obama is blatantly disregarding, and even suppressing, the fastest-growing collective voice in the nation right now—that of the patriotic Tea Party. His Union-Crony Purple Shirts have shown up at town-hall meetings and peaceful protests to intimidate and antagonize the democratic process.""

Book Of The Vision Quest,['Bear Sun'],"<p><b>Blending numerous heritages, wisdoms, and teachings, this powerfully wrought book encourages people to take charge of their lives, heal themselves, and grow.</b> Movingly rendered, <i>The Book of the Vision Quest</i> is for all who long for renewal and personal transformation. In this revised edition—with two new chapters and added tales from vision questers—Steven Foster recounts his experiences guiding contemporary seekers. He recreates an ancient rite of passage—that of “dying,” “passing through,” and “being reborn”—known as a vision quest. A sacred ceremony that culminates in a three-day, three-night fast, alone, in a place of natural power, the vision quest is a mystical, practical, and intensely personal journey of self-knowledge.</p>"
"Brave Men, Gentle Heroes: American Fathers And Sons In World War Ii And Vietnam",['Michael Takiff'],"<p><b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> presents the frank, moving, and harrowing stories of men who served in World War II and of their sons who served in Vietnam — fathers and sons bonded as deeply by their common experience in war as by blood.</p>
<p>These are men who served in the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps. Officers and enlisted men, career servicemen and citizen soldiers. Men of European, African, Asian, Latino, and Native American ancestry. Men who speak with the authentic voices of an Indiana farmer, a Brooklyn bus driver, a Louisiana businessman, a Seattle machinist. The contrasts between World War II and Vietnam are everywhere in these compelling accounts: the clear aims of World War II, the muddled goals of Vietnam; the heroes' welcome accorded World War II veterans, the scorn heaped upon their sons. But the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> are also rich with elements intrinsic to all wars and all soldiers: courage, honor, service, duty, youth, adventure, fear, idealism, love of country and of family, exasperation with military bureaucracy. In these pages you will find war's carnage and war's heroism, war's purpose and war's futility, war's meaning and war's tragic meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Taken together, the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> tell the history of two wars, each the defining experience of a generation. This is history told not at the level of presidents and generals, but through the recollections of men who shouldered the rifles, manned the ships, and flew the planes. We're familiar with the effects of the two wars on world politics. But what did they do to American families? Molded by the awful crucible of war, these seemingly ordinary men offer extraordinary insights into what it means to be a warrior, an American, a father, and a son.</p>
<p><b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> is a book for those who have been to war and those who have been spared its horror. It is a book for individuals to reflect upon and families to share.</p>"

<i>Discovering the Body</i> is a gripping novel filled with psychological suspense, sensitivity, and emotional complexity.

Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy.</p>
<p>A beautifully crafted tour de force of significant depth, passion, and power, <i>Discovering the Body</i> is a completely beguiling meditation on perception, loss, memory, and redemption whose conclusion proves to be as significantly haunting as it is satisfying.<br>

"Clean, Sweet Wind : Sailing with the Last Boatmakers of the Carribean",['Douglas C. Pyle'],"<p>A generation ago, before waves of tourism submerged traditional ways, Douglas Pyle spent half a decade sailing his small sloop from island to island in the eastern Caribbean, seeking out native whalers, fishermen, and traders to learn how they built their boats. <i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i>, his story of that time, is as much a portrait of an island people as it is a record of their work upon the sea. In these pages we glimpse a society as vivid as the aquamarine waters of the reefs and the patched sails of graceful boats.</p><p>As he explored the family traditions of the Antillean seafarers, Pyle found himself admiring one boatbuilder in particular, Haakon Mitchell of Bequia. Mitchell had been a fisherman until an accident cost him a hand; when Pyle met him, he and his sons were building a vessel for inter-island trade. Starting first as an observer, then as a helper, Pyle finally became one of the family, working on the new sloop each day and taking meals with Mitchell and his sons. Their lifelong friendship is a central theme of <i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i>.</p><p>But this is more than a lyrical evocation of a place and time. In his years among the islands Pyle collected information on all the different boat types sailing at the time. The second half of the book is a journey from Trinidad to the Virgin Islands, with a look at each type.</p><p><i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i> captures Antillean speech, beliefs, and hospitality with as faithful an accuracy as it renders the graceful designs of Caribbean boats. The result is both a detailed study of traditional watercraft and one of the finest regional narratives yet written.</p>"

Sam Halpern, who is ""like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair,"" has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him:</p>

<p>When an unexpected medical crisis sends Naomi Wolf on a deeply personal journey to tease out the intersections between sexuality and creativity, she discovers, much to her own astonishment, an increasing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the vagina is not merely flesh, but an intrinsic component of the female brain—and thus has a fundamental connection to female consciousness itself.</p>

The Washington century,['Burt Solomon'],"<p>An epic work of history ... the story of the American capital told through the lives of three families that each symbolize a different aspect of the city and the nation it embodies</p><p><b>The Washington Century</b> tells the captivating history of the nation's capital during the last century, made vivid through the struggles of three very different families, each representing an essential aspect of Washington. Veteran journalist Burt Solomon uses these families to explore everything from the customs of Washington's grand hostesses to the surge in the federal bureaucracy to the critical roles that politicking and lobbying have played as the capital has grown more truly democratic.</p><ul><li>The Boggs family came to Washington during the age of political giants. Hale Boggs, a prominent congressman from Louisiana, was the protÃ©gÃ© of Sam Rayburn and close friends with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. When Boggs died in a plane crash, he was succeeded by his widow, Lindy, a political power in her own right. Their son, Tommy Boggs, is one of the capital's most influential lobbyists, and their daughter, Cokie Roberts, is a distinguished member of the Washington press corps.</li><li>Real-estate developer Morris Cafritz changed the physical face of the city, giving form to Washington's new downtown, centered along K Street, which would become the center of activity for lobbyists and power brokers. His wife, Gwen, a legendary socialite, hosted the city's most exclusive parties, bringing together eminent politicians, jurists, and diplomats into a self-conscious elite.</li><li>Julius Hobson Sr. was a leading black activist in the first black-majority city in America. A brilliant and imaginative militant during the civil rights era, he served on D.C.'s first elected city council and fought for the capital's autonomy from the federal government before his death in 1977. His son, Julius Hobson Jr., became a political figure of a contrasting sort, an insider instead of an agitator, who worked for Mayor Marion Barry and went on to become the top lobbyist at the American Medical Association.</li></ul><p>Each family's story forms a strand of the city's single history. Their lives were entwined with those of other Washington notables - from Eleanor Roosevelt to Lady Bird Johnson, Perle Mesta, Stokely Carmichael, J. Edgar Hoover, Tip O'Neill, Jesse Jackson, John F. Kennedy, and even a twenty-six-year-old Bill Clinton.</p><p><b>The Washington Century</b> is also the behind-the-scenes biography of an intricate and ever-changing city, once a gracious capital that has become a money-driven and partisan place. Solomon's ingenious narrative, written with the pace and sense of a novel, is full of quirky moments and unforgettable characters, both familiar and unfamiliar to the American public, who made a sleepy, southern town into the soul of a nation. Compulsively readable, as enlightening as it is entertaining, here is a fascinating chapter of living history.</p>"

My Friend Michael: An Ordinary Friendship With An Extraordinary Man,['Frank Cascio'],"<p>Everyone knows Michael Jackson—the myth. This is the revealing true story of Michael Jackson—the man.</p>
<p>To Frank Cascio, Michael Jackson was many things—second father, big brother, boss, mentor, and teacher, but most of all he was a friend. Though Cascio was just a few years old when he first met Jackson in 1984, at the peak of the pop star’s career, Jackson was at the center of his life for the next twenty-five years, allowing Cascio to observe firsthand the greatest entertainer the world had ever seen. In that time, he became the ultimate Michael Jackson insider, yet remained publicly silent about his experiences. Until now.</p>
<p>In <b>My Friend Michael</b>, Cascio refutes the rumors, lies, and accusations that have accumulated over the years, providing a candid look at the Michael Jackson he knew for more than two decades. Offering an uplifting and definitive account of the legend, Cascio details how he grew up alongside Jackson, traveling the world with him on concert tours and eventually working for him. Through this lens, Cascio captures Jackson’s most private and tumultuous moments, while also setting the record straight on the entertainer’s notorious and misunderstood lifestyle—from his Peter Pan reality and his sexuality to the false allegations against him.</p>
<p>As Cascio shows, there was a great deal more to Michael Jackson than the headlines about him have suggested. Cascio reveals his friend in all his complexity, bringing to light his passions and joys as well as his flaws and eccentricities. Including stories about Jackson that have never before been made public, Cascio creates a balanced, human look at the pop star, one that shows Jackson as the very real person he was—a lively friend with an endearingly juvenile sense of humor.</p>
<p>What emerges is a clear-eyed yet deeply respectful portrait of Jackson—a man who was at times unremarkably average but also terribly scarred by his life in the spotlight. Packed with never-before-seen photos, anecdotes, and insights, <b>My Friend Michael</b> is a trove of Michael Jackson lore that both celebrates his life and redefines our understanding of the man behind the myth.</p>"

"The Accidental President: How 413 Lawyers, 9 Supreme Court Justices, And 5,963,110 Floridians (give Or Take A Few) Landed George W. Bush In The White House",['David A Kaplan'],"<p>For thirty-seven days after the disputed presidential election of 2000, we watched great theater, as George W Bush and Al Gore slugged it out in the swamp. You may think you've read it all before, but now <b>Newsweek's</b> David A. Kaplan goes behind the scenes of the sanctimony and machinations. In his critically acclaimed bestseller, <b>The Silicon Boys</b>, Kaplan took us inside Silicon Valley. In <b>The Accidental President</b>, he does the same for this epic moment in American history — a harmonic convergence of politics and law, media and culture.</p>
<p>With his mordant wit and incisive storytelling, Kaplan tells us how — contrary to popular belief — the Supreme Court's ruling for Bush was <b>not</b> a foregone conclusion and why the dissenting justices thought, until the last second, they could lure the one equivocating colleague they'd derisively nicknamed ""Flipper."" We're in the room when Gore decides that, more than any great lawyer, the one person he needs in Recountland is . . . Erin Brockovich. We learn which Bush partisan covertly marionetted the strings behind Katherine Harris. And we're treated to sketches of the characters they called Secret Squirrel and the Fine-Looking Man and of the political operative who jumped from a moving train.</p>
<p>Through it all — butterflies and boils; concessions, recantations, and fraternal recriminations; lawyers, more lawyers, and 181 invocations of the phrase ""uncharted waters"" — Kaplan paints a picture of an extraordinary episode for the country. There are few heroes in this tale. No person or institution comes out looking very good. ""Rule of law"" simply meant trying to figure out a way <b>around</b> the law — realpolitik by any other name.</p>
<p>The outcome of Bush versus Gore was a colossal fortuity, an election gone bad, made worse by an inconceivable coincidence of accidents. A lucky tactical call here, a confusing ballot there — amid all the folly and hypocrisy, these are what landed Bush in the White House. Different turns might have cast destiny the other way. Bush is our nation's first accidental president, just as Gore would have been. Bush may thrive or stumble in office. But either way, few will forget how he got there after November 7, 2000.</p>
<p>This is the definitive story of those thirty-seven days and why they matter.</p>"

He observes,'You canât always make your way in the world by moving up. Or down, for that matter. Boats move laterally on water, which levels everything. It is one of the two great levelers.' Part elegy, part quest, <b>Kayak Morning</b> explores Rogerâs years as a journalist, the comforts of literature, and the value of solitude, poignantly reminding us that grief is not apart from life but encompasses it. In recalling to us what we have lost, grief by necessity resurrects what we have had.</p>"

Boats With An Open Mind: Seventy-five Unconventional Designs And Concepts,['Philip C.

A planing microtrawler; a glass-galleried, beachable birdwatching boat; a fully enclosed ocean-cruising rowboat; cruising sailboats that take the ground at low tide; power, sail, and rowing boats from 6 to 95 feet—these are boats as only Bolger's unfettered imagination does them.

Annulment: Your Chance To Remarry Within The Catholic Church,"['Zwack, Joseph P.']","<p>Here is the only book that explains fully in lay terms the grounds and procedures by which Roman Catholics who have undergone civil divorces can also have their former marriages annulled by the Church.</p>
<p>In the last decade alone, annulements in the United States have increased from 350 to over 30,000. At present, there are an estimated eight million divorced American Catholics, banned from full participation in the Church if the remarry without obtaining an annulment. <b>Many of these people could obtain annulments</b> — yet, until the publication of <b>Annulment,</b> the lack of proper information and guidance has discouraged the majority of them.</p>
<p>This book makes available the rights of divorce Catholics under the Revised Code of Canon Law, which is now in effect. In everyday language, this authoritative handbook takes readers step by step through the process, defines the laws as they now exist, sorts through misconceptions and fears surrounding annulment procedures, dicusses the meaning and rationale behind the rules, lays out all the grounds (including the new psychological grounds), examines all factors (including costs), defines the various apporaches, and provides samples of the forms involved.</p>
<p>The author, a lawyer himself, consulted with canon lawyers, priests, and laypeople, — some of whom have already used his manual with success.<b>Annulment</b> offers hope and solid help to the increasing number of people directly and indirectly affected by the divorce-remarriage-annulment problem. Zwack cuts cleanly through the Gordian knot of uncertainty to point the way for realistic, clear, effective solutions to this longstanding, anguished problem.</p>

"The Stolen Prince: Gannibal, Adopted Son Of Peter The Great, Great-grandfather Of Alexander Pushkin, And Europe's First Black Intellectual",['Hugh Barnes'],"<p>In the spring of 1703, a young African boy stepped off a slave ship in Constantinople, the gateway between East and West. Huddling in chains, with other frightened captives, the seven-year-old claimed to be a prince of Abyssinia, a ""noble Moor"" kidnapped and stolen out of Africa. His tragedy was shared by millions of black people caught up in the Islamic slave trade, but his destiny was unique: rescued by Peter the Great, the young African became Abram Petrovich Gannibal.</p>
<p>Russia's westernizing tsar adopted the child and, in a bizarre nature-and-nurture experiment, lavished on him the best education available in the new ""European"" capital of Saint Petersburg. Gannibal, the ""Negro of Peter the Great,"" soared to dizzying heights as a soldier, diplomat, mathematician and spy. He was fêted in glittering salons, from the Winter Palace to the Louvre, and came to know Voltaire and Montesquieu, who praised him as the ""dark star of Russia's enlightenment."" At the same time, his military exploits, from northern Spain to the icy wastes of Siberia — to say nothing of his marital problems — sealed Gannibal's reputation as the Russian Othello.</p>
<p>African prince or not, the ex-slave founded a dynasty of his own in Russia, where he came to embody the strengths and weaknesses of the country itself — volatile, courageous, handsome, gifted and always astonishing. His descendants included not only Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet, but also, in England, several Mountbattens and others close to the royal family.</p>"

With his loyalties fatally divided between duty and passion, how can Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul?</p>"
Red Army: The Radical Network That Must Be Defeated to Save America,"['Aaron Klein', 'Brenda J. Elliott']","<p>In this original investigative work, the bestselling authors of <b>The Manchurian President</b> expose one of the most important untold stories of the decade: how a nexus of radical socialist groups have seized political power, shaped Obamaâs presidential agenda, and threaten the very future of our country.</p><p>For decades, a radical socialist movement has been quietly infiltrating the major institutions of American power: our schools, our military, our economy, our media, and Congress itself. This progressive Red Army is an organized network consisting of numerous specialized groups that target specific policy areas while cooperating more broadly in a concerted decades-long campaign to transform America.</p><p>Now, for the first time, investigative reporters Aaron Klein and Brenda J. Elliott not only expose the key players, organizations, and relationships in this radical network but chart their spheres of influence, their nefarious objectives, their role in shaping Barack Obamaâs agenda, and their long-term plans for the nation.</p><p>Among some of their finds, Klein and Elliott reveal the existence of a powerful 'Marxist-socialist' bloc in Congress (explicitly formed as an arm of the Democratic Socialists of America) and examine its far-reaching goals in policy areas that affect all Americans, including the complete socialization of health care and comprehensive immigration reform, which seeks to change the very nature of the American electorate. The authors expose the shocking misinformation campaign behind Obamaâs economic policies, discussing the crafting of the massive 'stimulus' legislation, as well as his plans for future economic 'reform.'</p><p>In two chapters that every American must read, entirely new information is laid bare on the leftâs unprecedented assault on our already over-liberalized education system. And in just one astonishing discovery, Klein and Elliott bring to light how federal stimulus money was used to fund an education group tied to radical educator (and unrepentant Pentagon bomber) Bill Ayers.</p><p>The authors also expose the multipronged policy offensive aimed at disarming America by emboldening our enemies within and without, spurning traditional allies, subjecting us to the authority of foreign tribunals, and systematically dismantling the U.S. military. The authors also detail how elements of the news media not only collude with these radical groups, but are in some cases members of the very same extremist organizations they ought to be investigating.</p><p>This radical network runs far deeper than the Obama administration and, if not stopped, will far outlast his presidency. From health care and manufacturing to immigration and environmental policy, <b>Red Army</b> documents how these radical groups are working to spread Americaâs wealth and transform the country into their vision of a socialist utopia.</p>"

I Am the Change: Barack Obama and the Crisis of Liberalism,['Charles R. Kesler'],"<p>Is Barack Obama the savior of liberalism-or the last liberal president? Charles R. Kesler's spirited analysis of Obama's political thought shows that he represents either a new birth of liberalism-or its demise.</p><p>Who is Barack Obama? Though many of his own supporters wonder if he really believes in anything, Charles R. Kesler argues that these disappointed liberals don't appreciate the scope of the president's ambition or the long-term stakes for which he is playing.</p><p>Conservatives also misunderstand Obama, according to this leading conservative scholar, educator, and journalist. They dismiss him as a socialist, hopelessly out of touch with the American mainstream. The fringe Right dwells on Obama's foreign upbringing, his missing birth certificate, Bill Ayers's supposed authorship of his books. What mainstream and fringe have in common is a stubborn underestimation of the man and the political movement he embodies.</p><p>Reflecting a sophisticated mix of philosophy, psychology, and history, and complemented by a scathing wit, <b>I Am the Change</b> tries to understand Obama as he understands himself, based largely on his own writings, speeches, and interviews. Kesler, the rare conservative who takes Obama seriously as a political thinker, views him as a gifted and highly intelligent progressive who is attempting to become the greatest president in the history of modern liberalism. Intent on reinvigorating the liberal faith, Obama nonetheless fails to understand its fatal contradictions-a shortsightedness that may prove to be liberalism's undoing.</p><p>Will Obama save liberalism and become its fourth great incarnation, following Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson? Or will he be derailed by his very successes? These are the questions at the heart of Kesler's thoughtful and illuminating book.</p>"

Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity In North Korea And The Other's Fight To Bring Her Home,"['Laura Ling', 'Lisa Ling']","<p>On March 17, 2009, Laura Ling and her colleague Euna Lee were working on a documentary about North Korean defectors who were fleeing the desperate conditions in their homeland. While filming on the Chinese–North Korean border, they were chased down by North Korean soldiers who violently apprehended them. Laura and Euna were charged with trespassing and ""hostile acts,"" and imprisoned by Kim Jong Il's notoriously secretive Communist state. Kept totally apart, they endured months of interrogations and eventually a trial before North Korea's highest court. They were the first Americans ever to be sentenced to twelve years of hard labor in a prison camp in North Korea.</p>
<p>When news of the arrest reached Laura's sister, journalist Lisa Ling, she immediately began a campaign to get her sister released, one that led her from the State Department to the higher echelons of the media world and eventually to the White House.</p>
<p><b>Somewhere Inside</b> reveals for the first time Laura's gripping account of what really happened on the river, her treatment at the hands of North Korean guards, and the deprivations and rounds of harrowing interrogations she endured. She speaks movingly about the emotional toll inflicted on her by her incarceration, including the measures she took to protect her sources and her fears that she might never see her family again.</p>
<p>Lisa writes about her unrelenting efforts to secure Laura and Euna's release. Offering insights into the vast media campaign spearheaded on the women's behalf, Lisa also takes us deep into the drama involving people at the highest levels of government, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Senator John Kerry, and Governor Bill Richardson—intense discussions that entailed strategically balancing the agendas and good intentions of the various players. She also describes her role in the back-and-forth between North Korea's demands and the dramatic rescue by former President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Though they were thousands of miles apart while Laura was in captivity, the Ling sisters' relationship became a way for the reclusive North Korean government to send messages to the United States government, which helped lead to Laura and Euna's eventual release.</p>
<p>Told in the sisters' alternating voices, <b>Somewhere Inside</b> is a timely, inspiring, and page-turning tale of survival set against the canvas of international politics that goes beyond the headlines to reveal the impact on lives engulfed by forces beyond their control. But it is also a window into the unique bond these two sisters have always shared, a bond that sustained them throughout the most horrifying ordeal of their lives.</p>"

"What Zizi Gave Honeyboy: A True Story About Love, Wisdom, And The Soul Of America",['Gerald Celente'],"<p>One recent spring Gerald Celente went to visit his cuddly eighty-three-year-old Italian aunt, Zizi, in Yonkers, New York. He was expecting the same delectable combination of food, friendship, and motherly love that Zizi had served up through the years at her little kitchen table. But Celente got more than he expected. Over chicken cutlets and games of Scrabble, the straight-talking Zizi raised some tough questions for her nephew, ""Honeyboy,"" to consider. Targeting some of the essential issues of our time-work, family, health care, politics, war, and aging in America — Zizi made Celente think about whether America was delivering on its promises. Have we lost too many timeless old-world values in the march of progress? Are we really better off today than we were yesterday? And what does the future hold for each one of us, our families, and our community as a whole?</p>
<p>Celente thought he had it all figured out. As the founder of the Trends Research Institute, he is well respected for his track record of picking business, consumer, political, and economic trends before they come to pass. It is his job to see the future and understand how the issues and events of today will determine the trends of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But it took Zizi to help him see the unsettling truths about what has happened to America over the last several decades. They would talk about the world they once knew — a world filled with family, dinners together, and Sundays at church. Zizi would remember ""back then"" with fondness, and Celente would recall his years growing up with his parents and six siblings. As they reflect on their pasts, their lives, and where we've arrived as a nation, Celente and Zizi realize that something has been lost. There is an emptiness that most of us feel. But what is the cause of it? And what can we do to fix it?</p>
<p>In <b>What Zizi Gave Honeyboy,</b> Gerald Celente provides a provocative look at our lives today and a glimpse of the future we deserve in Zizi's warmth, her recipes, and her wisdom.</p>"

<p>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.</p>
<p>During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</p>
<p>Veronica Roth is the <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author of <b>Divergent</b>, the first in a trilogy of dystopian thrillers filled with electrifying decisions, heartbreaking betrayals, stunning consequences, and unexpected romance.</p>"

"Facing Codependence: What It Is, Where It Comes From, How It Sabotages Our Lives","['Pia Mellody', 'Andrea Wells Miller', 'J. Keith Miller']","<p>Pia Mellody creates a framework for identifying codependent thinking, emotions and behaviour and provides an effective approach to recovery. Mellody sets forth five primary adult symptoms of this crippling condition, then traces their origin to emotional, spiritual, intellectual, physical and sexual abuses that occur in childhood. Central to Mellody's approach is the concept that the codependent adult's injured inner child needs healing. Recovery from codependence, therefore, involves clearing up the toxic emotions left over from these painful childhood experiences.</p>

Here is the first comprehensive boater's guide to the almost 2,000 miles of shoreline and more than 300 islands that lie between Washington's capital of Olympia and the Canadian border at Point Roberts, including the San Juans.</p>

The Taliban Cricket Club: A Novel,['Timeri N. Murari'],"<p>Rukhsana is a spirited young journalist who works for the <b>Kabul Daily</b> in Afghanistan. She takes care of her ill, widowed mother and her younger brother, Jahan. But then Rukhsana is summoned to appear at the infamous Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, and their quiet and tenuous way of life is shattered.</p>
<p>There, the malevolent minister, Zorak Wahidi, announces that the Taliban has found a new way to pursue the diplomatic respect it has long been denied: cricket. On the world stage of sports, the Taliban will prove they are a fair and just society. Rukhsana and several other journalists are to report that a tournament will be held to determine who will play for Afghanistan. Anyone can put together a team. Women are forbidden to play. The winners will travel to Pakistan to train, then go on to represent Afghanistan around the world.</p>
<p>Rukhsana knows that this is a shameful, and deeply surreal, idea. The Taliban will never embrace a game rooted in civility, fairness, and equality, with no tolerance for violence or cheating. And no one in Afghanistan even knows how to play the game.</p>
<p>Except for Rukhsana.</p>
<p>This could be a way to get her cousins and her brother out of Afghanistan for good. But before she can organize a team, the terrifying Wahidi demands her hand in marriage. He finds her both exciting and infuriating, and wants to control her unruly, willful nature. The union would be her prison, stripping away what few freedoms she has left under Taliban rule and forcing her away from her family. Not marrying Wahidi, however, might mean her death. Her family rallies around her, willing to do anything to protect her, even if it means imprisonment or worse.</p>
<p>But Rukhsana realizes that Wahidi may have given her a way out, too. With the help of her loyal, beloved brother and cousins, she forms her own cricket team and sets about teaching them how to win their freedom—with a bat and a ball.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Taliban's actual and unprecedented promotion of cricket in 2000 in an attempt to gain acceptance in the global community, internationally bestselling author Murari weaves a riveting story of strength, hope, and soaring human triumph that proves no tyranny is ever absolute in the face of love.</p>"

Never To Forget: The Jews Of The Holocaust,['Milton Meltzer'],"<p>Six million— a number impossible to visualize. Six million Jews were killed in Europe between the years 1933 and 1945.

<p><i>Charlotte's Web</i> is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilbur—and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn.</p>
<p>With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and by a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to quite a pig.</p>
<p>How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language.</p>
<p>The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.</p>


                        <p>Wilbur the pig is desolate when he discovers that he is destined to be the farmer's Christmas dinner until his spider friend, Charlotte decides to help him.

Handbook Of Psychological Assessment (pergamon General Psychology Series),"['Michel Hersen', 'Gerald Goldstein']","<p>The field of psychological assessment has been undergoing rapid change. The second edition of this Handbook, published in 1990, appeared at the beginning of a decade marked by extensive advances in assessment in essentially all of its specialized areas. There are many new tests, new applications of established tests, and new test systems. Major revisions have appeared of established tests, notably the Wechsler intelligence scales. The time seemed right for a third edition, since even over the relatively brief period of ten years, many tests described in the second edition have been replaced, and are no longer commonly used. Furthermore, much new research in such areas as neuropsychology, cognitive science, and psychopathology have made major impacts on how many tests and other assessment procedures are used and interpreted. This third edition represents an effort to give the reader an overview of the many new developments in assessment, while still maintaining material on basic psychometric concepts in order for it to continue to serve as a comprehensive handbook for the student and professional.<br>

I'm Your Man: The Life Of Leonard Cohen,['Sylvie Simmons'],"<p>The legend behind such songs as “Suzanne,” “Bird on the Wire” and “Hallelujah” andthe poet and novelist behind such groundbreaking literary works as <em>Beautiful Losers</em> and <em>Book of Mercy</em>, Leonard Cohen is one of the most important and influential artists of our era, a man of powerful emotion and intelligence whose work has explored the definitive issues of human life—sex, religion, power, meaning, love. Cohen is also a man of complexities and seeming contradictions: a devout Jew, who is also a sophisticate and ladies’ man, as well as an ordained Buddhist monk whose name, Jikan—“ordinary silence”—is quite the appellation for a writer and singer whose life has been anything but ordinary.</p>
<p><em>I’m Your Man</em> is the definitive account of that extraordinary life. Acclaimed music journalist Sylvie Simmons crafts a portrait of Cohen as nuanced as the man himself, drawing on a wealth of research that includes Cohen’s personal archives and more than a hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to Cohen—from his lovers, friends, monks, professors, rabbis and fellow musicians to his muses, including Rebecca De Mornay, Marianne Ihlen, Suzanne Elrod and Suzanne Verdal—and most important, with Cohen himself, whose presence infuses these pages.</p>
<p>Starting in Montreal, Cohen’s birthplace, where he first found fame as a poet in the fifties, Simmons follows his trail, via London and the Greek island of Hydra, to New York in the sixties, where he launched his music career. From there she traces the arc of his prodigious achievements to his remarkable retreat in the mid-nineties—when on the cusp of marriage to a beautiful actress and enjoying the success of his best-selling album to date, he entered a monastery on a rocky mountaintop above Los Angeles—and finally to his reemergence for a sold-out world tour almost fifteen years later. Whether navigating Cohen’s journeys through the back streets of Mumbai or the countless hotel rooms where he has stayed along the way, Simmons explores with equal focus every complex, contradictory strand of Cohen’s life—from the halls of academia to the arenas of rock ’n’ roll—and presents a deeply insightful portrait of both the artist and the man whose vision, spirit, depth and talent continue to move people like no one else.</p>"

"Buy, Lie, And Sell High: How Investors Lost Out On Enron And The Internet Bubble","['D. Quinn Mills', 'Daniel Quinn Mills']","<p>Why did the Internet and Enron stock collapses really happen? Was it arrogance? Greed? The ""madness of crowds""? Just plain bad luck? Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>In <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i>, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills offers the first systematic analysis of both the Internet stock bubble and the Enron scandal. Drawing upon new research-including an extensive review of the latest lawsuits and securities documents-Mills uncovers both systemic causes and outrageous misbehavior. He demonstrates how each link in the ""financial value chain,"" from venture funds to auditors and regulators, not only failed to protect small investors, but also actively contributed to their losses.</p>
<p>Mills demonstrates why it didn't have to be that way, comparing the U.S. experience with that of Germany, which experienced its own Internet stock bubble with far milder consequences to ordinary investors. He then offers practical and detailed recommendations for investors, citizens, and policymakers seeking to keep it from happening again.</p>
<p>Includes exclusive interviews with and contributions by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ted Dintersmith, Charles River Ventures</li>
<li>Julian Kurz, The Boston Consulting Group</li>
<li>Robert Glauber, CEO/President, National Association of Security Dealers</li>

<li>Juergen Kohr, entrepreneur, DATACOM.net</li>
</ul>
<p>The Internet bubble: What really happened—and why.</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse</li>
<li>Why the Internet stock collapse was no accident</li>
<li>Who lost—and who benefited</li>
<li>How the disaster could have been averted</li>
<li>Avoiding the next speculative bubble: techniques for investors, recommendations for policymakers</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors lost millions of dollars in the Internet collapse—and, according to conventional wisdom, they only have themselves to blame for being greedy, shortsighted, and ignorant of business fundamentals. But is that the real story? In this riveting and insightful book, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills argues that the Internet bubble and subsequent collapse was no accident: Blame can be placed squarely at the feet of venture firms, investment banks, accountants, mutual funds, brokerages, federal regulators, and the Federal Reserve—not ""dumb small investors."" Through extensive original research and the contributions of many active participants, <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i> offers authoritative answers to the questions every investor is asking: ""What actually happened during the Internet bubble?"" ""Who got the money I lost?"" ""Why did it happen?"" ""Who's to blame?"" ""What can I do about it?"" ""Will it happen again, and how can I keep it from happening to me?""</p>
<p>Mills compares the U.S. Internet bubble with events in Germany, where an Internet bubble also arose—but with radically different and far less serious consequences. Drawing on the same ideas, he also offers the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse. Then Mills presents a specific, rigorous analytical structure for helping investors avoid future bubbles—as well as the first detailed proposals for effective reform.</p>
<p>Through extensive original research and the contributions of many active participants, <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i> offers authoritative answers to the questions every investor is asking: ""What actually happened?"" ""Who got the money I lost?"" ""Why did it happen?"" ""Who's to blame?"" ""What can I do about it?"" And most important of all, ""Will it happen again, and how can I keep it from happening to me?""</p>"
Devlin's Boatbuilding: How To Build Any Boat The Stitch-and-glue Way,['Samual Devlin'],"<p>Why is stitch-and-glue boatbuilding so popular?</p>
<p>Any number of construction methods will produce a beautiful boat. But for the backyard builder with limited experience and a tight budget, the choice is not so complicated. Traditional plank-on-frame and cold-molded construction require complicated lofting and building molds—to say nothing of expensive tooling and lots of time. Stitch-and-glue construction, on the other hand, can produce the same results with a substantial savings in time and money. The process is quicker, easier, uses fewer parts, and produces a boat that is much easier to maintain—without the building molds and with only the simplest lofting. For tools, you need little more than a circular saw, a sander/polisher/grinder, a block plane, a framing square, a level, and a tape measure.</p>
<p>Sam Devlin has elevated stitch-and-glue boatbuilding to an artform, and his graceful designs have attracted the attention of backyard builders across the country. Here is all you need to know to build the boat of your dreams, whether it's a 7-foot dinghy or a 40-foot power cruiser. <i>Devlin's Boatbuilding: How to Build Any Boat the Stitch-and-Glue Way</i> shares the wisdom of his 16 years of experience designing, building, and helping others build his fleet of small sail- and powerboats.</p>
<p>It's all here, from choosing a design and setting up shop to painting the finished hull and launching. There is also a gallery of Devlin's designs and a detailed appendix listing sources for tools and other materials.</p>"

Inversions: A Catalog Of Calligraphic Cartwheels,"['Kim, Scott.']","Backword by Jef Raskin
<p>""Inversions"" are words that read the same upside down or in a mirror. Or words cleverly hidden inside other words. Each has something to fool the eye, a special visual trick; at the same time the words Kim has chosen to illustrate in this imaginative catalog of challenging visual wordplay reflect the idea of symmetry, both in art and in science.</p>
<p>Sixty pages of images portray short and long words, words describing symmetries, variations on Gödel, Escher, Bach and on calligraphic themes, and contemporary, historical, and personal names. They are followed by an illustrated text that explores the skills that go into making inversions: symmetry, vision, and letterforms; processes and examples; and associations with music, wordplay, and art. The book is designed so that the text is also symmetrical - what is said in the lefthand column of a page frequently matches the meaning of what is said in the righthand column.</p>

Our Fathers' Wells: A Personal Encounter With The Myths Of Genesis,['Peter Pitzele'],"Born of thoroughly assimilated Jewish parents, Peter Pitzele journeys back from his various odysseys in alternative faiths to search out the roots of his own birthright. In discovering and claiming just what that means to him, he plants his focus firmly in the biblical book of Genesis. Here he finds the first articulation of those mythic paradigms that will form in time the legacy of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Here are ""the fathers' wells,"" the deep and difficult source texts for our imagination of God. Pitzele's approach to Genesis is personal and pluralistic. He reads not only with a detailed knowledge of the tales, but with the imagination of a psychodramatist. Scripture for him is full of dramatic possibility and psychological truth. The great cast of archetypal figures - Adam, Eve, Cain, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph - are given a fuller dimension in his rendering of their stories. Woven throughout are slices of Pitzele's own personal history, demonstrating the relationship between myth and experience, between the profound images of the Western spiritual tradition and the life of a man who wrestles with his roles as father, husband, son, and brother. In the spirit of conservation, Pitzele seeks to clarify the wells of our spiritual inheritance. His journey of exploration and self-discovery has an immediacy for any of us grappling to find meaning and relevance in the gifts of the past. His purpose is not merely to retell but to re-animate our foundational stories and to bring them to bear on our own lives."

Bruce Chatwin,['Nicholas Shakespeare'],"Bruce Chatwin's death from AIDS in 1989 brought his meteoric career to an abrupt end. His reputation as a storyteller has grown over the last decade, and his exquisite, subtle texts continue to inspire readers all over the world. Chatwin was different things to different people: a director at Sotheby's, an archaeologist, a journalist, photographer and art collector. Married for 23 years, he was also an active homosexual. He was at once a socialite mixing with the rich and famous, and a loner who explored the limits of extreme solitude. From unrestricted access to Chatwin's private notebooks, diaries and letters, Nicholas Shakespeare has compiled the definitive biography of one of the most charismatic and elusive literary figures of our time."

Turn Off The Hunger Switch: Reset Your Brain To Change Your Weight,['Paul Rivas'],"Do you have a weakness for sweets? Do you feel hungry all the time? Do you eat when you're feeling sad? Do you eat just for the sake of eating? If you do, you do not have an eating problem. You have a brain chemistry problem -- a glitch in your hunger switch. In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, diet specialist Paul Rivas, M.D., shows how the excessive hunger that creates weight gain is a direct result of erroneous brain chemistry messages which turn on your hunger switch. Turn it off, and your hunger -- and weight problem -- disappears. Dr. Rivas's revoltionary no-diet, no-exercise plan places you into one of the following types: You are a type ""N"" with a norepinephrine deficiency if: You feel tired frequently and blame your fatigue for your weight. Your weight climbs for no apparent reason. You are a type ""S"" with a serotonin deficiency if: You crave chocolate. You eat out of boredom. You eat large quantities of food at one sitting. You are a type ""D"" with a dopamine deficiency if: You continue to crave salt or sweets even after various medications have been tried; You are easily distracted. You are a type ""C"" with a carbohydrate sensitivity if: You can't lose weight even if you have excellent appetite control; Low-calorie diets don't work; You strongly crave mainly carbohydrates like pasta and bread.
<p> In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, Dr. Rivas leads you on the discovery of your personal hunger buttons and shows you the methods by which you can turn them on and off at will. Ninety percent of Dr. Rivas' 10,000 patients have successfully lost weight and maintained their weight loss for years by following his unique plan which uses safe, well-tested, doctor-prescribed medications, nutrients, or natural supplements to bring hunger and cravings under immediate control.

Harper Collins Publishers Annos Counting Book (set Of 12),['Mitsumasa Anno'],"Every child is a natural mathematician, according to Mitsumasa Anno. Children start to count long before they learn their ABC's, for they are constantly comparing and classifying things and events they observe around them. As they try to bring sense and order into what they observe, they are actually performing basic mathematical feats.
<p>In this book, Mitsumasa Anno, the creator of the brilliantly inventive Anno's Alphabet, invites young readers on another stimulating adventure of the imagination-this time into the world of numbers and counting. Gentle watercolor pictures show a landscape changing through the various times of day and the turning seasons, months and years, and the activities of the people and animals who come to live there. But the seemingly simple plan of the book is deceptive: look more carefully and you will see one-to-one correspondences; groups and sets; scales and tabulations; changes over time periods; and many other mathematical relationships as they occur in natural, everyday living. Just as our forebears developed our number system from observing the order of nature, the reader is subtly led to see and understand the real meaning of numbers.</p>
<p>Look at this book and look again. Each time you do so, you will find another application of a natural mathematical concept that you had not noticed before.</p>

                        <p>IBM may be the Rodney Dangerfield of computing. IBM turns out one world-class product after another, but you wouldn't always realize it from reading the trade press. Take, for example, IBM's Net.Commerce PRO 3.1.1, a web commerce platform with awesome power and flexibility. If you've ever shopped at L.L. Bean online, you've used Net.Commerce. If you're building an industrial-strength e-commerce site, it ought to be on your short list. But many decision-makers aren't familiar with it.

<p>Written with IBM's product developers, this is a detailed look at what it takes to build a Net.Commerce site, from shopping carts to security, catalogs to search features.

All In The Same Boat: Family Living Aboard And Cruising,['Tom Neale'],"In 1979 the Neales left their law and education careers and traded their home in a suburban neighborhood for a three-room boat. Now, their neighborhood is a Chesapeake Bay cove, or a secluded Bahamian beach, or anywhere else they choose to anchor. And along the way they raised two daughters. All in the Same Boat is one family's testament to the belief that you can lead your own life, whatever that might be. For the Neales, it hasn't been a vacation. Instead of mowing the lawn, they fix the watermaker or make bread from scratch; instead of trying to find good schools for the kids, they make their own good school; instead of living to work, they work to live, making time for adventure and play. Here is how they do it, and how you can do it too, with hard-won tips, practical suggestions, and life lessons on everything from developing a cruising frame of mind to choosing and customizing the right boat to dealing calmly with the myriad problems, big and small, that will ship with you on your journey."
Whitefish Can't Jump: And Other Tales Of Gamefish On The Fly,['E. Donnall Thomas'],"In his Preface to Whitefish Can't Jump, Don Thomas writes: ""A space alien arriving on the Big Hole during the middle of the salmon-fly hatch might conclude that the same sport an earlier writer had trouble distinguishing from religion is really about entomology, fashionable outdoor wear, and power, all of which is wrong. Above all else, fly-fishing is about fish and the places they are found."" Here, then, are nineteen fly-fishing stories refreshingly devoid of Latin, pink shirts, and angling glitterati - stories where the fish and the places they are found unabashedly occupy center stage. On the flats of Christmas Island, the fusion of Fin-Nor and bonefish becomes only the second lifetime experience to live up to its advance billing. On a river in southwestern Alaska, boating a huge rainbow where no huge rainbow should be becomes more important than avoiding a midstream collision with a nine-foot grizzly. A Montreal gas-station attendant's tip leads to a far-northern pond and a harrowing encounter with The Ultimate Northern Pike. The quixotic quest for a permit on a fly in Belize is marred only slightly by a dissolving marriage and a Blue Crab Special impaled in a philosophical guide's ear. In Siberia, Dolly Varden, vodka, and the novelty of Catch-and-Release combine to thaw the cold war. And in the Yellowstone River, a new season begins with Rocky Mountain Whitefish and the reminder of just how arbitrary the distinction between gamefish and just-plain-fish can be. And why it ultimately doesn't matter. From each story we learn a little about fishing, a lot about fish, and a thing or two about life - or at least the kind of life where time spent on the water with fly rod in hand is infinitely more important than time spent anywhere else.

                        <p>In these nineteen lyrical stories, E. Donnall Thomas, Jr., presents an absorbing celebration of the fly-fishing lifestyle. From Alaska, to Christmas Island, to the Ultimate Northern Pike, to Yellowstone and other locales, we discover in these stories a little about fishing and a lot about life.

Faraday In 90 Minutes (scientists In 90 Minutes Series),"['John Gribbin', 'Mary Gribbin']","In this easy-to-read series, eminent science writers John and Mary Gribbin look at the lives and work of eight major scientists.

The iconic Albert Einstein emerges as a dashing ladies' man and the greatest scientist of his time; but why did Charles Darwin wait for decades before going public with his ideas on evolution? How was Marie Curie's great work shaped by her childhood experiences of oppression under the Czars? And what was Edmond Halley, of comet fame, doing as Captain of a King's Ship and later spy for the Crown? An introduction and afterword places each scientist's work in the context of the development of their subject."

"Surface Activity: Principles, Phenomena And Applications (polymers, Interfaces And Biomaterials)",['Kaoru Tsujii'],"Surfaces and interfaces are concepts of fundamental importance in materials science and technology. All materials have surfaces. When two or more materials are put together, interfaces appear. In composite materials, interfaces play a crucial role in determining mechanical, optical, and electronic properties.<br>
<br>
Surfaces and interfaces can be dramatically altered when surfactant molecules are applied to them, modifying not only the interactions between two materials at the interface, but also the bulk properties of a composite. Surfactants are key materials in processes involving adhesion, coating, mixing, domain formations, and many other phenomena in the medical, pharmaceutical, chemical, and electronic industries.<br>
<br>
Surfactants exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena such as formations of micelles, vesicles, layers, and gels. They provide a fascinating example of self-assembly. Surfactants have many phases and undergo phase transitions between them. Understanding these phenomena is a great challenge for physics and chemistry, and is of increasing technological importance.<br>
<br>
Dr. Kaoru Tsujii is one of the pioneers and leaders in the science and technology of surfactants. He has long expolored the field, both in theory and in industrial applications, and seeks to demonstrate applications of surfactants in our everyday life and industry. The book will serve as an excellent text and reference for researchers and students who wish to know more about surfactants.

                        <p><b>Audience:</b> Researchers, engineers, professors, and graduate students in materials science (polymers) fields, chemical engineering, chemistry, and pharmacology.

Pilate: The Diary Of An Invented Man,['Ann Wroe'],"Very little is known for certain about Pontius Pilate, the man who crucified Christ, but this has not stopped writers in every age from imagining his life. In this extraordinary book, Ann Wroe recounts the lives of all our Pilates, among them the glittering medieval tyrant devoted to gambling; the early-Christian intellectual; the beleaguered Victorian administrator; the Coptic saint, martyred on the cross; the Alpine devil, in league with Satan to claim the souls of mountain climbers; and the wriggling modern pragmatist, whose dilemma over Jesus has been described by Tony Blair as ""a timeless parable of political life.""<br>
<br>
This is also the story, as far as it can be reconstructed from archaeology and from classical sources, of the real Pilate: his likely background, his career, his duties, his failings, his fears, and the attitude he might have had to the various forms of thinking he encountered in Judea. Ann Wroe shows how, in his struggles with fate and free will, Pilate's story has also become the story of ourselves."

The Force Of The Past: A Novel,"['Sandro Veronesi', 'Alastair Mcewen']","What do we know about our parents — <br>
their true ideals, beliefs, and dreams?<br>
How can we be certain? 
<p>Shortly after his father's death, Gianni Orzan reaches the disturbing conclusion that his father did not love him. Aloof and dismissive, Maurizio Orzan seldom had anything to say to his son. Moreover, he was a staunch fascist.</p>
<p>Or so Gianni thought. Then comes the day he's contacted by a complete stranger who has a disquieting familiarity with his life. In what amounts to kidnapping, the stranger pursues an urgent mission: to convince Gianni that the father he knew was an illusion; that Maurizio was, in fact, a double agent for the KGB.</p>
<p>What is Gianni to believe? If this stranger's revelations are true, they threaten to destroy Gianni's steadfast beliefs about his father's shameful, self-created identity and promise to send his life crashing down around him.</p>
<p>Narrated with deft wit and subtle reflection, <i>The Force of the Past</i> — winner of Italy's Viareggio-Repaci Prize and the Premio Campiello and a finalist for the Zerilli-Marimò prize — is an insightful look at how one son tries to comprehend his father's mysterious complexities, as well as a provocative, ironic examination of how men construct their own subjective versions of reality.</p>
