9781935001126,Born Amish,"['Ruth Irene Garrett', 'Deborah Morse-kahn']","""But what was your life like before?"" 
<p>This is the question that RUTH IRENE GARRETT, nee Miller, has been asked again and again by the thousands of inspired and fascinated guests who have attended her lectures and programs on her life growing up Amish to young womanhood, when she fell in love with an ""Englisher"" and left the Amish community to begin her new life out in the world.</p>
<p>Now, working with co-author and friend DEBORAH MORSE-KAHN, we learn about Ruth Irene Garrett's early life as a child growing up in the Amish farming community of Kalona, Iowa: school, games, and chores; work, crafts, and foods; clothing, farming and tumbling about with many brothers and sisters. We learn about the expectations for girls and boys in Amish families, of social roles and understandings about courtship and marriage, about adult baptism and a life of faith in the Amish Church.</p>

9781934206812,The Gnostic Bible: The Pistis Sophia Unveiled,['Samael Aun Weor'],"""It came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and instructing them..."" (The Pistis Sophia) 
<p>The Apostles wrote down what Jesus taught them during those eleven years, resulting in ""The Pistis Sophia,"" the most important Gnostic scripture. Includes an extensive commentary by Samael Aun Weor. ""The Pistis Sophia"" is a sophisticated and deeply mystical teaching given by Jesus about the suffering of Sophia as she attempts to ascend to the highest spiritual truth. This scripture is remarkable for its profound mysticism, its clear rebuke of unethical behavior, and its perspective on the spiritual role of women. Having read this text, it becomes very clear why the established religious powers attempted to obliterate the Gnostics, but failed. Study of this teaching also inspires a re-evaluation of how the Christian Gospels have been interpreted for centuries.</p>
<p>About this scripture, the commentary author Samael Aun Weor said, """"The Hebrew Bible clearly connotes the Word of the Eternal One. However, we, the Gnostics, also have our very special Bible. I want to emphatically declare that this is The Pistis Sophia, whose original is in Coptic. It was found underground in Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs. The Pistis Sophia contains all the words of the adorable Savior of the world. It was written by the Apostles. Thus, all the Esoteric-Christic instructions that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples on the Mount of the Olives and other holy places is written within this book. This book had been conserved in secret for many centuries. In this book, the Adorable One left an extraordinary, formidable body of doctrine.""</p>"

9781933392899,Renewing America's Food Traditions: Saving And Savoring The Continent's Most Endangered Foods,['Gary Paul Nabhan'],"<br>
<i>Renewing America's Food Traditions</i> is a beautifully illustrated dramatic call to recognize, celebrate, and conserve the great diversity of foods that gives North America its distinctive culinary identity that reflects our multicultural heritage. It offers us rich natural and cultural histories as well as recipes and folk traditions associated with the rarest food plants and animals in North America. In doing so, it reminds us that what we choose to eat can either conserve or deplete the cornucopia of our continent.
<p>While offering a eulogy to a once-common game food that has gone extinct--the passenger pigeon--the book doesn't dwell on tragic losses. Instead, it highlights the success stories of food recovery, habitat restoration, and market revitalization that chefs, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and foresters have recently achieved. Through such ""food parables,"" editor Gary Paul Nabhan and his colleagues build a persuasive argument for eater-based conservation.</p>
<p>In addition, this book offers the first-ever list of foods at risk in America (more than a thousand), shows how all of us can personally support and participate in such recoveries, and lists food festivals held across the continent to honor and enjoy some of the country's most iconic foods, from crab cakes to maple syrup and filé gumbo. Organized by ""food nations"" named for the ecological and cultural keystone foods of each region--Salmon Nation, Bison Nation, Chile Pepper Nation, among others--this book offers an altogether fresh perspective on the culinary traditions of North America.</p>"

9781933392110,The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved: Inside America's Underground Food Movements,['Sandor Ellix Katz'],"<br>
An instant classic for a new generation of monkey-wrenching food activists. Food in America is cheap and abundant, yet the vast majority of it is diminished in terms of flavor and nutrition, anonymous and mysterious after being shipped thousands of miles and passing through inscrutable supply chains, and controlled by multinational corporations. In our system of globalized food commodities, convenience replaces quality and a connection to the source of our food. Most of us know almost nothing about how our food is grown or produced, where it comes from, and what health value it really has. It is food as pure corporate commodity. We all deserve much better than that. 
<p>In <i>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved</i>, author Sandor Ellix Katz (<i>Wild Fermentation</i>, Chelsea Green 2003) profiles grassroots activists who are taking on Big Food, creating meaningful alternatives, and challenging the way many Americans think about food. From community-supported local farmers, community gardeners, and seed saving activists, to underground distribution networks of contraband foods and food resources rescued from the waste stream, this book shows how ordinary people can resist the dominant system, revive community-based food production, and take direct responsibility for their own health and nutrition.</p>"

You've read the stories and watched the documentaries. So you're convinced--burning fossil fuels leads to global climate change; supplies of fossil fuels are diminishing in quantity and increasing in price.

As he travels, he contemplates his childhood; a complicated friendship with the son of a lonely neighbour; his parents' broken marriage and his own.

<p>He recalls his first trip to Germany with his newly single father. He is mindful of something he neglected to do there, an omission which threatens to have devastating repercussions for him this time around.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Futh, sunburnt and blistered, comes to the end of his circular walk, returning to what he sees as the sanctuary of the Hellhaus hotel, unaware of the events which have been unfolding there in his absence.</p>

I became an athlete. And not just any athlete, but a runner—all without taking a running step until I was 43 years old.</p>
<p>Known by fans as ""The Penguin"" for his back-of-the-pack speed, John Bingham is the unlikely hero of the modern running boom. In this warm, witty memoir, the best-selling author and columnist recalls his childhood dreams of athletic glory, sedentary years of unhealthy excess, and a life-changing transformation from couch potato to ""adult-onset athlete.""</p>
<p>Overweight, uninspired, and saddled with a pack-and-a-half-a-day smoking habit, Bingham found himself firmly wedged into a middle-age slump. Then two scary trips to the emergency room and a conversation with a happy piano tuner led him to discover running—and changed his life forever.</p>
<p>In turns inspiring, poignant, hilarious, and heartbreaking, <i>An Accidental Athlete</i> is the story of the unexpected joys of running—the pride of the finisher’s medal, a bureau-busting t-shirt collection, intense back-of-the-pack strategizing. And one man’s discovery that middle age was not the finish line after all, but only the beginning.</p>"

<p>Written by arguably the most important horror writer of the twentieth century, H. P. Lovecraft’s 1927 essay “Supernatural Horror in Literature” traces the evolution of the genre from the early Gothic novels to the work of contemporary American and British authors. Throughout, Lovecraft acknowledges those authors and stories that he feels are the very finest the horror field has to offer: Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson, Guy de Maupassant, Ambrose Bierce, and Arthur Conan Doyle, each prefaced by Lovecraft's own opinions and insights in their work. This chilling collection also contains Henry James’ wonderfully atmospheric short novel <b>The Turn of the Screw</b>.</p>
<p>For every fan of modern horror, here is an opportunity to rediscover the origins of the genre with some of most terrifying stories ever imagined.</p>"

<p>A superpower without parallel since the British Empire, the United States is a source of incessant fascination to the rest of the world. Absurdly rich, alarmingly volatile, we inspire both fear and envy. Just as our aggressive foreign policy has turned our allies against us, the rise of Barack Obama is now seen as our salvation. 9/11, the world historical event that “changed everything,” has been superseded by 11/4, the date of his election to the presidency of the United States. Through it all, “America” remains a phenomenon, a myth, the wonder of the world.</p>
<p>“Know thyself” is a difficult injunction to follow and often requires the insights of others. To gain some perspective, <b>How They See Us</b> features writers and intellectuals from around the globe. These trenchant essays constitute a primer of international literature, an aid to self-criticism, and an invitation to celebrate our national virtues.</p>"

<p>Ann Meyers Drysdale is one of the greatest stars in the history of basketball. But her rise wasn't without controversy. Her 1979 NBA bid to play with the Indiana Pacers brought a barrage of criticism. But Ann simply wanted to play among the best. She had always competed with the guys, and she never let anyone keep her down. In <i>You Let Some Girl Beat You?</i> she shares her inspirational story for the first time.</p>
<p>A female first in many categories, Meyers Drysdale was the first woman ever signed to a four-year athletic scholarship to UCLA, where she remains the only four-time Bruin basketball All American, male or female. Ann was also the only woman ever asked to compete in ABC Sports' <i>Superstars</i>, pitting her against elite athletes like Mark Spitz, Joe Frazier, O.J. Simpson, and Mark Gastineau.</p>
<p>After her athletic career <b>Ann Meyers Drysdale</b> went on to do color commentary on all the national stations. She also married Don Drysdale, legendary pitcher and announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, making them the first ever married couple enshrined in their respective sport's Hall of Fame. Today Ann continues to break through barriers. She is the only female vice president in the NBA (she is vice president of the Phoenix Suns), and is also the general manager of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, which has won two WNBA championships since she took over four years ago. <i>The New York Times</i> featured her prominently in a piece in August 2011 called ""Pioneers Continue to Shepherd Women's Basketball."" <i>Time</i> magazine recently named her one of the ten greatest female athletes of all time.</p>"

<p>From the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for “writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history...""</p>
<p>The acclaimed Hungarian Holocaust survivor Imre Kertész continues his investigation of the malignant methodologies of totalitarianism in a major work of fiction.</p>
<p>In a mysterious middle–European country, a man identified only as “the commissioner” undertakes what seems to be a banal trip to a nondescript town with his wife—a brief detour on the way to a holiday at the seaside—that turns into something ominous. Something terrible has happened in the town, something that no one wants to discuss. With his wife watching on fearfully, he commences a perverse investigation, rudely interrogating the locals, inspecting a local landmark with a frightening intensity, traveling to an outlying factory where he confronts the proprietors ... and slowly revealing a past he's been trying to suppress.</p>
<p>In a limpid translation by Tim Wilkinson, this haunting tale lays bare an emotional and psychological landscape ravaged by totalitarianism in one of Kertsz's most devastating examinations of the responsibilities of and for the Holocaust.</p>
<p><b>The Contemporary Art of the Novella</b> series is designed to highlight work by major authors from around the world. In most instances, as with Imre Kertész, it showcases work never before published; in others, books are reprised that should never have gone out of print.

And as with the original series, The Art of the Novella, each book is a beautifully packaged and inexpensive volume meant to celebrate the form and its practitioners.</p>"

9781932857856,Circle Of Six: The True Story Of New York's Most Notorious Cop Killer And The Cop Who Risked Everything To Catch Him,"['Jurgensen', 'Randy']","<p><i>Circle of Six</i> is the true story of what is perhaps the most notorious case in the history of the New York Police Department. It details Randy Jurgensen's determined effort to bring to justice the murderer of Patrolman Phillip Cardillo, who was shot and killed inside Harlem's Mosque #7 in 1972, in the midst of an all-out assault on the NYPD from the Black Liberation Army. The New York of this era was a place not unlike the Wild West, in which cops and criminals shot it out on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Despite the mayhem on the streets and the Machiavellian corridors of Mayor Lindsay's City Hall, Detective Jurgensen single-handedly took on the Black Liberation Army, the Nation of Islam, NYPD brass, and City Hall, capturing Cardillo's killer, Lewis 17X Dupree. He broke the case with an unlikely accomplice, Foster 2X Thomas, a member of the Nation of Islam who became Jurgensen's witness. The relationship they formed during the time before trial gave each of the two men a greater perspective of the two sides in the street war and changed them forever. In the end, Jurgensen had to settle for a conviction on other charges, and Dupree served a number of years. The murder case is still officially unsolved. In 2006 the NYPD re-opened the case, and it is once again an active investigation with full media attention.</p>
<p>The book has received acclaim from current New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, as well as former Commissioner William Bratton.</p>"
9781932841640,Freeman,['Leonard Jr. Pitts'],"<p><i>Freeman</i>, the new novel by Leonard Pitts, Jr., takes place in the first few months following the Confederate surrender and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Upon learning of Lee's surrender, Sam—a runaway slave who once worked for the Union Army—decides to leave his safe haven in Philadelphia and set out on foot to return to the war-torn South. What compels him on this almost-suicidal course is the desire to find his wife, the mother of his only child, whom he and their son left behind 15 years earlier on the Mississippi farm to which they all ""belonged.""</p>
<p>At the same time, Sam's wife, Tilda, is being forced to walk at gunpoint with her owner and two of his other slaves from the charred remains of his Mississippi farm into Arkansas, in search of an undefined place that would still respect his entitlements as slaveowner and Confederate officer.</p>
<p>The book's third main character, Prudence, is a fearless, headstrong white woman of means who leaves her Boston home for Buford, Mississippi, to start a school for the former bondsmen, and thus honor her father’s dying wish.</p>
<p>At bottom, <i>Freeman</i> is a love story—sweeping, generous, brutal, compassionate, patient—about the feelings people were determined to honor, despite the enormous constraints of the times. It is this aspect of the book that should ensure it a strong, vocal, core audience of African-American women, who will help propel its likely critical acclaim to a wider audience. At the same time, this book addresses several themes that are still hotly debated today, some 145 years after the official end of the Civil War. Like <i>Cold Mountain</i>, <i>Freeman</i> illuminates the times and places it describes from a fresh perspective, with stunning results. It has the potential to become a classic addition to the literature dealing with this period. Few other novels so powerfully capture the pathos and possibility of the era particularly as it reflects the ordeal of the black slaves grappling with the promise—and the terror—of their new status as free men and women.</p>"

Sartre was a member the French underground during World War II, a novelist, a playwright, and a major influence in French political and intellectual life. The book opens with a biographical section, introducing the significant events in the life of the man who coined the term, “Existentialism.” Then it examines Sartre’s early philosophical works. Ideas from Sartre’s other fictional and dramatic works are discussed, but the greatest part of the book is the presentation of the main concepts from Sartre’s <i>Being and Nothingness</i> (1943). These ideas include the topics of consciousness, freedom, responsibility, absurdity, “bad faith”, authenticity and the hellish confrontation with other people. Finally, the book deals with Sartre’s modification of his earlier existentialism to compliment his conversion to a kind of “existential” Marxism. <i>Sartre For Beginners</i> summarizes the work of the most renowned philosopher of the 20th century.</p>"

9781931414203,Taj Mahal: A Story Of Love And Empire (wonders Of The World Book),"['Elizabeth Mann', 'Alan Witschonke']","<p><i>The Magnificent Mughals of India.</i></p>
<p>Shah Jahan, ruler of India, murdered three of his brothers in his bloody rise to power. Yet when his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, suddenly died, the grief-stricken emperor built the world's most beautiful tomb as a monument to her memory.</p>
<p>Shah Jahan was the fifth emperor of the Mughal dynasty. The Mughals combined the brute force and fierce ambition of their legendary ancestor Genghis Khan with a delicate artistic sensitivity. Theirs was a world where even forts were architectural gems, where emperors had their life stories told in exquisite miniature paintings, and where each new ruler competed with the previous one by building a grander palace, fort, mosque and city.</p>

9781934708569,Entangled: The Eater Of Souls,['Graham Hancock'],"<p>Graham Hancock has spent decades researching and writing some of the most ambitious and successful nonfiction investigations into ancient civilizations and wisdom. <i>Entangled</i> uses all of Hancock's skills and knowledge to propel a fantasy adventure like nothing else preceding it.</p>
<p><i>Entangled</i> is a time-slip novel alternating between present-day California, Brazil, and prehistoric Spain, with two teenage female protagonists who must come together to avert an incredibly bloodthirsty takeover of the human race.</p>
<p><i>Entangled</i> is the first book in a trilogy relating the story of an unrelentingly evil master magician named Sulpa who is on the loose and determined to destroy humanity. Leoni, a troubled teen from modern-day Los Angeles, and Ria, a young woman who lives in Stone Age Spain, meet in a parallel dimension outside the flow of time to stop Sulpa's spectacular, deadly materialization of the modern world.</p>
<p><i>Entangled</i> rides a growing wave of interest in parallel dimensions and imaginary worlds (<i>The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>The Golden Compass</i> are recent Hollywood examples) and will have immediate appeal to readers of Philip Pullman, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Kate Mosse, among others.</p>
<p>But <i>Entangled</i> has the added merit of being grounded in solid anthropological and scientific research. Hancock calls on his years of research into cutting-edge issues, including the ""Neanderthal Enigma,"" the nature of consciousness, the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, parallel realms, time travel, and near-death and out-of-body experiences.</p>"

9781906868697,The Meat Free Monday Cookbook: A Full Menu For Every Monday Of The Year,['Meat Free Monday Campaign'],"<p>In 2009, Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney launched the Meat Free Monday campaign as a simple and straightforward idea to show everyone the value of eating less meat – and to make it easier for us to do so. Cutting down the amount of meat in our diet has a huge range of environmental and personal benefits, including significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with livestock production, boosting our health by increasing the amount of fruit and vegetables in our diet, and helping us save money by offering substitutes for expensive meat and fish. Often, though, our vegetarian repertoire is limited, with the result that our enthusiasm to continue with a meat-free day wanes when we are confronted with yet again eating the same dish. With menus for each of the 52 weeks of the year – two main recipes, plus four other ideas for each meal of the day – The Meat Free Monday Cookbook addresses this problem and is aimed at everyone who cares about the environment, is happy to eat vegetarian one day a week, but needs inspiration and guidance to do so. Packed with vibrant spring soups, inventive summer salads, appetizing fall casseroles and comforting winter stews, the recipes include such enticing dishes as Grilled Figs with Ricotta, Spiced Pumpkin Pancakes, Sicilian Cauliflower Pasta, Mexican Cornbread, Pilau Rice with Cashews, French Bean, Roquefort and Walnut Salad, Watermelon Granita, Hot Mozzarella Sandwich, Roasted Halloumi Wrap and Onion and Walnut Muffins, and cover everything from alternatives to the ubiquitous ham sandwich in your packed lunch and the traditional cooked breakfast to satisfying snacks for when hunger strikes. With contributions from Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney, as well as celebrity and chef supporters of the campaign such as Skye Gyngell, Giorgio Locatelli, Yotam Ottellenghi, Tom Aikens, Kevin Spacey, Pink, Twiggy, Woody Harrelson, Vivienne Westwood and Pamela Anderson, The Meat Free Monday Cookbook is guaranteed to tempt even the most confirmed carnivore. The Meat Free Monday campaign was launched by Paul, Stella and Mary McCartney in 2009 and its message is One Day a Week Can Make a World of Difference. The campaign aims to encourage everyone to do their bit to help protect our planet by demonstrating that by giving up meat for one day each week you can save money, reduce your environmental impact and live a healthier life.</p>"

9781930491144,Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self,['Robert Waggoner'],"<p>Lucid Dreaming: Gateway to the Inner Self is the account of an extraordinarily talented lucid dreamer who goes beyond the boundaries of both psychology and religion. In the process, he stumbles upon the Inner Self. While lucid (consciously aware) in the dream state and able to act and interact with dream figures, objects, and settings, dream expert Robert Waggoner experienced something transformative and unexpected. He was able to interact consciously with the dream observer - the apparent Inner Self - within the dream. At first this seemed shocking, even impossible, since psychology normally alludes to such theoretical inner aspects as the Subliminal Self, the Center, the Internal Self-Helper in vague and theoretical ways. Waggoner came to realize, however, that aware interaction with the Inner Self was not only possible, but actual and highly inspiring. He concluded that while aware in the dream state, one has both a psychological tool and a platform from which to understand dreaming and the larger picture of man's psyche as well. Waggoner proposes 5 stages of lucid dreaming and guides readers through them, offering advice for those who have never experienced the lucid dream state and suggestions for how experienced lucid dreamers can advance to a new level. Lucid Dreaming offers exciting insights and vivid illustrations that will intrigue not only avid dreamworkers but anyone who is interested in consciousness, identity, and the definition of reality.<br></p>"

9781932234633,"Buddha, Vol. 8: Jetavana",['Osamu Tezuka'],"<p>Osamu Tezuka’s vaunted storytelling genius, consummate skill at visual expression, and warm humanity blossom fully in his eight-volume epic of Siddhartha’s life and times. Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha’s ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka’s Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one’s life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers’ attention.</p>
<p>Tezuka himself was a humanist rather than a Buddhist, and his magnum opus is not an attempt at propaganda. Hermann Hesse’s novel or Bertolucci’s film is comparable in this regard; in fact, Tezuka’s approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humor.</p>"

<p>""The heroine is an offbeat amateur sleuth with a distinctive narrative voice. Fans of such female detectives as Amanda Cross's Kate Fansler and Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fisher will find a lot to like.""—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>
<p>Kati Hirschel, the owner of Istanbul's only mystery bookstore, is fed up. It all started when her lover Selim insisted that she behave like the Turkish wife of a respectable lawyer. Looking demure and making witty small talk were the only requirements. Then her landlord announced an outrageous rent increase on her Istanbul apartment.</p>
<p>She has no desire to move in with Selim. She'd rather learn the art of bribing government officials in order to find a new place. Kati is offered a large apartment with a view over the Bosphorus at a bargain price. Too good to be true until a man is found murdered there and she becomes the police's prime suspect.

This breeds a new generation of kids suffering from multiple concussions and damaged lives. <i>Throwaway Players</i> offers guidance to parents navigating the world of competitive sports as well as advocacy and resources for athletes often left in the dark about appropriate procedures for treating injuries, especially head traumas. <i>Throwaway Players</i> is essential reading for any parent, athlete, and sports fan.</p>
<p><b>Gay Culverhouse</b> testified before Congress on football head injuries and successfully changed the policy of including an independent neurologist on the sidelines of every NFL game. Gay's work with former players has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Sarasota Herald Tribune</i>, <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>, <i>The Tampa Tribune</i>, <i>Time</i> magazine, and many more. She has appeared on several radio shows, including PBS and ESPN, and is featured in three documentaries that are in post-production (with CNN, ESPN, and an independent filmmaker).

9781929173068,Not Without Peril: 150 Years Of Misadventure On The Presidential Range Of New Hampshire,['Nicholas Howe'],"<p>The Presidential Range of New Hampshire is like few places in the world. Located only 150 miles north of a major city, the range is home to beautiful alpine gardens, stunning vistas, and a carefully maintained network of hiking trails. But these same mountains can offer some of the world's worst weather. While the valleys below are bathed in warm sunshine, the exposed summits may be lashed by hurricane-force winds, blinding snows, and numbing cold. Into this potentially deadly environment come hikers, skiers, and climbers by the thousands, drawn by the beauty, accessibility, and history of the mountains. It is a recipe for challenge, adventure - and tragedy. Not Without Peril offers extensive and intimate profiles of twenty-two climbers who found trouble on the Presidential Range from 1849 to 1994. Summer snowstorms, raging rivers, impenetrable fog banks, and a single misplaced step are all part of the dangers awaiting even the most careful hiker. Veteran journalist Nicholas Howe sifted through crumbling archives, interviewed dozens of participants, and hiked the mountains to retrace each fateful journey. The result is a compelling story of our changing relationship with the mountains we love and the risks they pose. (6 x 9, 320 pages, maps, b&amp;w photos)</p>"
9781933372716,"A Day In The Life Of Ancient Rome: Daily Life, Mysteries, And Curiosities",['Alberto Angela'],"<p>The roar of frenzied spectators inside the Coliseum during a battle between gladiators. A crowd of onlookers gathered around a slave driver. The wondrous plenty of banquets where flamingos are roasted whole and wine flows like rivers. The silence of the baths and the boisterous taverns . . . Many books have dealt with the history of ancient Rome, but none has been able to bring its readers so near to daily life in the Imperial capital.</p>
<p>This extraordinary voyage of exploration, guided by Alberto Angela with the charm of a born story- teller, lasts twenty- four hours, beginning at dawn on an ordinary day in the year 115 A.D., with Imperial Rome at the height of its power. The reader wakes in a rich patrician home and discovers frescoes, opulent furnishings and richly appointed boudoirs. Strolling though the splendors of the Roman Forum, one overhears both erudite opinions from learned orators and local ribaldry floating out from the public latrines. One meets the intense gazes of Roman matriarchs strolling the streets, looks on as a banquet is prepared, and is afforded a peek into the sexual habits and fetishes of Roman patricians and plebs. For all those who have ever dreamed of traveling back in time, Alberto Angela's narrative style will come as a welcome change to dry historical tomes. Rich in atmosphere and historical information, <i>A Day in Ancient Rome</i> is a voyage into a world both distant to us in time and surprisingly near in its habits, mores, and passions.</p>"

<p>No writer I know of comes close to even trying to articulate the weird magic of poetry as Ruefle does. She acknowledges and celebrates in the odd mystery and mysticism of the act—the fact that poetry must both guard and reveal, hint at and pull back... Also, and maybe most crucially, Ruefle’s work is never once stuffy or overdone: she writes this stuff with a level of seriousness-as-play that’s vital and welcome, that doesn’t make writing poetry sound anything but wild, strange, life-enlargening fun. -<i>The Kenyon Review</i></p>
<p>Profound, unpredictable, charming, and outright funny...These informal talks have far more staying power and verve than most of their kind. Readers may come away dazzled, as well as amused... -<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>
<p>This is a book not just for poets but for anyone interested in the human heart, the inner-life, the breath exhaling a completion of an idea that will make you feel changed in some way. This is a desert island book. -<i>Matthew Dickman</i></p>
<p>The accomplished poet is humorous and self-deprecating in this collection of illuminating essays on poetry, aesthetics and literature... -<i>San Francisco Examiner</i></p>

9781931082075,Steinbeck Novels 1942-1952: The Moon Is Down / Cannery Row / The Pearl / East Of Eden (library Of America),['John Steinbeck'],"<p>This third volume in The Library of America's authoritative edition of <b>John Steinbeck</b>'s writings shows one of America's most enduring popular writers continuing restlessly to explore new subject matter and new approaches to storytelling.</p>
<p><b>The Moon Is Down</b> (1942), set in an unnamed Scandinavian country under German occupation, dramatizes the transformation of ordinary life under totalitarian rule and the underground struggle against the Nazi invaders. In <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945) Steinbeck paid tribute to his closest friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, in the central character of Doc, proprietor of the Western Biological Laboratory and spiritual and financial mainstay of a cast of philosophical drifters and hangers-on. The comic and bawdy evocation of the main street of Monterey's sardine-canning district has made this one of the most popular of all Steinbeck's novels. Steinbeck's long involvement with Mexican culture is distilled in <b>The Pearl</b> (1947). Expanding on an anecdote he had heard about a boy who found a pearl of unusual size, Steinbeck turned it into an allegory of the corrupting influence of sudden wealth. <b>The Pearl</b> appears here with the original illustrations by José Clemente Orozco.</p>
<p>Ambitious in scale and original in structure, <b>East of Eden</b> (1952) recounts the violent and emotionally turbulent history of a Salinas Valley family through several generations. Drawing on Biblical parallels, <b>East of Eden</b> is an epic that explores the writer's deepest and most anguished concerns within a landscape that for him had mythic resonance.</p>"
9781931788786,Teun Hocks,['Teun Hocks'],"<p>Though Dutch artist Teun Hocks-performer, photographer, painter-is widely known and shown around the world, this will be his first English-language book. In it, Hocks plays his signature role, which Janet Koplos describes as an innocent Everyman in an always strange and often funny world, in scenes that range from burlesque to tragicomic. His lonely Buster Keaton-like persona perseveres through odd and unforgiving environments, struggling to find stable ground in an unstable, even absurd, universe. Life's complications and challenges take the form of impossible Rube Goldbergian contraptions fraught with psychological implications. Each engaging image captures one moment of an implied narrative, triggering questions about how the protagonist ever got himself into such a fix and what in the world will happen next. Hocks begins by sketching out various one-man narratives, and then poses himself in a carefully plotted setup against his own painted backdrop. After photographing the scene, he paints in oil on top of the resulting oversize gelatin silver print. In addition to his painted photographs,<i>Teun Hocks</i> includes drawings, Polaroids and studio shots that illuminate the artist's creative process. The wit, elaborate technique and rich colors of Hocks's images combine to form an irrepressibly original oeuvre.</p>"

9781926812663,"Ballerina: Sex, Scandal, And Suffering Behind The Symbol Of Perfection",['Deirdre Kelly'],"<p>Throughout her history, the ballerina has been perceived as the embodiment of beauty and perfection— the feminine ideal. But the reality is another story. From the earliest ballerinas in the 17th century, who often led double lives as concubines, through the poverty of the corps de ballet dancers in the 1800’s and the anorexic and bulimic ballerinas of George Balanchine, starvation and exploitation have plagued ballerinas throughout history.</p>
<p>Using the stories of great dancers such as Anna Pavlova, Isadora Duncan, Suzanne Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, and Evelyn Hart, Deirdre Kelly exposes the true rigors for women in ballet. She rounds her critique with examples of how the world of ballet is slowly evolving for the better. But to ensure that this most graceful of dance forms survives into the future, she says that the time has come to rethink ballet, to position the ballerina at its center and accord her the respect she deserves.</p>"

9781934389690,Gender & Sexuality For Beginners,['Jaimee Garbacik'],"<p>We should not need to prove our experiences, defend our realities, or negotiate basic human rights. But we do.</p>
<p>What does sexual orientation mean if the very categories of gender are in question? How do we measure equality when our society's definitions of ""male"" and ""female"" leave out much of the population? There is no consensus on what a ""real"" man or woman is, where one's sex begins and ends, or what purpose the categories of masculine and feminine traits serve. While significant strides have been made in recent years on behalf of women's, gay and lesbian rights, there is still a large division between the law and day-to-day reality for LGBTQIA and female-identified individuals in American society. The practices, media outlets and institutions that privilege heterosexuality and traditional gender roles as ""natural"" need a closer examination.</p>
<p>Gender and Sexuality For Beginners considers the uses and limitations of biology in defining gender. Questioning gender and sex as both categories and forms of compulsory identification, it critically examines the issues in the historical and contemporary construction, meaning and perpetuation of gender roles. Gender and Sexuality For Beginners interweaves neurobiology, psychology, feminist, queer and trans theory, as well as historical gay and lesbian activism to offer new perspectives on gender inequality, ultimately pointing to the clear inadequacy of gender categories and the ways in which the sex-gender system oppresses us all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gender and Sexuality For Beginners examines the evolution of gender roles and definitions of sexual orientation in American society, illuminating how neither is as objective or ""natural"" as we are often led to believe.</p>"

These young men would find a pride in themselves that would last forever. Those survivors of boot camp training often look back, with a smile and even a laugh, at what they endured from the DI. Patrick Turley, driven to enlist by the events of 9/11, captures these anxious times perfectly in vivid detail establishing an emotional bond with the reader throughout his journey from man to Marine, and John Patrick Shanley said it only as a former Marine and Pulitzer Prize winner could: It's great to have gone to Marine Corps boot camp. It's terrible to be in Marine Corps boot camp. It's fun to read about Marine Corps boot camp.</p>"

9781933197609,1968; The Year That Saved Ohio State Football,['David Hyde'],"1968 begins in the mens' room of an exclusive Columbus restaurant and ends two years later in The Rose Bowl, an unwitting but flawless metaphor for Ohio State University's rise to the pinnacle of college football. Between these two events occurs one of the great adventure stories in the history of the sport. Against a backdrop of national turmoil and international crises, Coach Wayne Woodrow Hayes uncharacteristically brings into his lagging program new young coaches and an impressive bunch of extraordinary kids, including the first significant number of African-Americans. There is an irreverent military school lineman who begins the school's lifting program by bringing his own weights, a Brooklyn fullback who can't believe Ohio's open spaces, a running back with New Jersey street-gang cred, and a homegrown quarterback with a bad back and an unassailable talent. All of them labor under the shadow of Hayes, the promethean figure who would leave an indelible legacy as one of the century's great coaches--sly, mercurial, pugnacious, maddeningly contradictory, a larger-than-life figure who carries the football ambitions of an entire state on his beefy shoulders. 1968 is a rich tapestry of scenes and stories throughout an incandescent season, including some of the best football dialogue ever written. In scene after scene, the raw intensity of an unforgettable season pulls the reader along to its breathless climax in Pasadena when the Super Sophs take on one of college's greatest running backs. It's a story that has everything--great drama, achievement, colorful characters, and the complex unfolding of Woody Hayes's multifaceted personality. Near the end of a chaotic decade, the Buckeyesprovide a badly needed feel-good lift to an entire state. And just as Woody predicted, they found themselves a large, inextricably bound family, tied forever by the commonalities of blood--literally theirs--sweat, tears, laughter, and, of course, their near-miraculous season."

<br>

Over the past three decades, Dubravka Ugresic has established herself as one of Europe’s greatest—and most entertaining—thinkers and creators, and it’s in her essays that Ugresic is at her sharpest. With laser focus, she pierces our pop culture, dissecting the absurdity of daily life with a wit and style that’s all her own.<br>

<br>

Whether it’s commentary on jaded youth, the ways technology has made us soft in the head, or how wrestling a hotel minibar into a bathtub is the best way to stick it to The Man, Ugresic writes with unmatched honesty and panache. KARAOKE CULTURE is full of candid, personal, and opinionated accounts of topics ranging from the baffling worldwide-pop-culture phenomena to the detriments of conformist nationalism. Sarcastic, biting, and, at times, even heartbreaking, this new collection of essays fully captures the outspoken brilliance of Ugresic’s insights into our modern world’s culture and conformism, the many ways in which it is ridiculous, and how (deep, deep down) we are all true suckers for it."

9781931082549,Democracy in America,"['Tocqueville, Alexis De , 1805-1859']","Alexis de Tocqueville, a young aristocratic French lawyer, came to the United States in 1831 to study its penitentiary systems. His nine-month visit and subsequent reading and reflection resulted in <i>Democracy in America</i> (1835—40), a landmark masterpiece of political observation and analysis. Tocqueville vividly describes the unprecedented social equality he found in America and explores its implications for European society in the emerging modern era. His book provides enduring insight into the political consequences of widespread property ownership, the potential dangers to liberty inherent in majority rule, the importance of civil institutions in an individualistic culture dominated by the pursuit of material self-interest, and the vital role of religion in American life, while prophetically probing the deep differences between the free and slave states. The clear, fluid, and vigorous translation by Arthur Goldhammer is the first to fully capture Tocqueville's achievements both as an accomplished literary stylist and as a profound political thinker."
9781933045207,"Dada: Zurich, Berlin, Hannover, Cologne, New York, Paris","['Dickerman, Leah , 1964-']","Along with Russian constructivism and surrealism, Dada stands as one of the three most significant movements of the historical avant-garde. Born in the heart of Europe in the midst of World War I, Dada displayed a raucous skepticism about accepted values. Its embrace of new materials, of collage and assemblage techniques, of the designation of manufactured objects as art objects as well as its interest in performance, sound poetry, and manifestos fundamentally shaped the terms of modern art practice and created an abiding legacy for postwar art. Yet, while the word Dada has common currency, few know much about Dada art itself. In contrast to other key avant-garde movements, there has never been a major American exhibition that explores Dada specifically in broad view. <i>Dada</i>—the catalogue to the exhibition on view in 2006 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and The Museum of Modern Art in New York presents the hybrid forms of Dada art through an examination of city centers where Dada emerged: Zurich, Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, New York, and Paris. Covered here are works by some 40 artists made in the period from circa 1916, when the Cabaret Voltaire was founded in Zurich, to 1926, by which time most of the Dada groups had dispersed or significantly transformed. The city sections bring together painting, sculpture, photography, collage, photomontage, prints and graphic work. <br>
 <br>
Relying on dynamic design and vivid documentary images, <i>Dada</i> takes us through these six cities via topical essays and extensive plate sections; an illustrated chronology of the movement; witty chronicles of events in each city center; a selected bibliography; and biographiesof each artist—accompanied by Dada-era photographs."

She plans to kill herself on the sixteenth of June, her thirteenth birthday.</p>
<p>Both Renée and Paloma hide their true talents and finest qualities from the bourgeois families around them, until a wealthy Japanese gentleman named Ozu moves into building.

9781908117809,Five of the Few,['Steve Darlow'],"Churchill's 'Few' will forever be remembered by history as men who thwarted the seemingly invincible German war machine, when all seemed lost. They countered the full force of the Luftwaffe in the daylight battles during the summer of 1940, and in the night skies of the winter and spring of 1940/41. They were at the time, and still are, perceived as knights of the air, as our heroes. Now, five distinguished RAF airmen, four pilots and one radar operator/navigator, who fought that air battle during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, have recounted their experiences in detail to author Steve Darlow. Their stories have never before been published, and they talk engagingly of their service life, combats, losses, injuries, friendships and fears - flying Spitfires, Hurricanes, Blenheims, Beaufighters and Havocs. One pilot tells of the time he fell victim to the enemy - 'My Spitfire stopped being a flying machine, it became a lump of metal. I was going down with it and I couldn't get out. I broke the seat by standing on it. The pressure throwing me into the bottom was terrific . . . ' A Beaufighter radar operator remembers being involved in shooting down a German aircraft - 'He took a vertical dive, struck the ground and exploded with a shower of incendiaries. I felt like a child with a new toy. I had at last proved myself but for some reason I suddenly felt a little sad.' But Five of the Few is not just about the experiences of these men during 1940/41. They would also distinguish themselves in subsequent air campaigns - night defense of the UK, offensive operations over the continent and support to D-Day and beyond. In between the aerial combats and ground attack operations, promotions, decorations and command responsibilities would come their way. But not all would make it through safely to the end of the war. One would end up behind barbed wire. Collectively Five of the Few is a war story of youth maturing, through aspiration and idealism, courage and bravado, fear and heroism, memory and reflection. It is a reminder of why so much was owed, and still is, by so many to so few."

<p>Batmanglij's cookbooks reflect the tradition and culture of her Persian background and the multi-tasking demands of a busy mother and professional. She views preparing a meal not only as a culinary experience, but also as a means to bring family and friends together. She encourages her readers to do as she was taught in Iran: to cook, to laugh, to tell jokes and stories, and to recite poetry. Over the past quarter century, Batmanglij's books have acted as both a beacon and a bible to Iranian-American and mixed-ethnicity families in the English-speaking world. Food of Life is one of the few volumes whose breadth ranges from the exacting measures that go into cooking a perfect bowl of rice to the intricacies of a traditional ancient Persian marriage ceremony. Her life and her work meet at the vortex of feminism, tradition, ceremony, and the nourishment of body and mind, proving that none of these concepts need be foreign to one another.</p>
<p>ABOUT PERSIAN FOOD<br>
You know more about Persian food than you might think. When you ask for oranges, pistachios, spinach, or saffron, you are using words derived from Persian that refer to foods either originating in the region or introduced from there, for Persia was a great entrepôt of the ancient and medieval worlds. The land was the first home of many common herbs, including basil cilantro, and spices such as fenugreek and cumin, as well as vegetables that include fava beans and chickpeas. Iran was also home to scores of familiar preparations, including sweet and sour sauces, kababs, noodles, marzipan, and baklava. Such preparations are most delicious in their original forms, which you will find in the recipes in this book.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE PERSIAN NEW YEAR<br>
The publication of this book coincides with the arrival of the Persian new year, Nowruz. Nowruz is the most important holiday for Iranians all over the world. Nowruz ceremonies consist of a series of symbolic rituals dating back to pre-Islamic ancient times. Nowruz is not a religious holiday but a celebration of the earth, which everyone can enjoy wherever they are and whatever their religion may be. The Nowruz celebrationalways begins on the first day of spring marked by the vernal equinox, or Tahvil, when the sun crosses the celestial equator. This year Nowruz falls on March 20 at 7:21 PM Eastern DST.</p>
<p>To welcome the new year, Iranians thoroughly clean and rearrange their homes. They buy new clothes, bake pastries, germinate seeds, color eggs, and prepare a menu of green dishes as signs of renewal. Troubadours, called Haji Firuz or ""heralds of rebirth,"" disguised with makeup and wearing red outfits, sing and dance through the streets with tambourines, kettle drums, and trumpets to spread good cheer and the news of the coming new year. In every Iranian household a ceremonial setting called sofreh-ye haft sinn is spread to symbolize rebirth and renewal, and to welcome the arrival of the new year (see page 562).</p>
<p>ABOUT THE USE OF PERSIAN AND IRANIAN IN FOOD OF LIFE<br>
All the recipes come from the land Europeans have long called Persia. That name is the Hellenized form of Pars, the southwestern province that was the homeland of the rulers of the first Persian Empire. They, however, called themselves Iranians and their country Iran, the name of their ancestral tribes. Nowadays the words are used interchangeably, describing a people whose civilization and cuisine are ancient indeed. Cooking plays important roles in every culture, but Persian cuisine can claim a relationship to its native land that is uniquely deep and intricate. This book celebrates the central place of food in the life of Iran, a story extending back almost 4,000 years, when recipes were first recorded in a cuneiform script on clay tablets.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE BOOK'S TITLE<br>
Food of Life, the title of the book, comes from the Persian words nush-e jan, literally ""food of life""—a traditional wish in Iran that a dish will be enjoyed. For the updated 1993 edition the title was changed to New Food of Life.Now, for the 25th anniversary edition the title returns to its original name, Food of Life.</p>"

 His wife Nancy was raising two children and writing from home. She was worrying about field trips and playdates, not about her husband going to war.<br>

9781928660378,East Wind,"['Ruth Hunt', 'Maria Zeitner Linke']","East Wind is the incredible story of Maria Zeitner Linke—of her indomitable spirit and courageous faith as she faced the death camps and prisons of Stalin's Russia. “Only one who has felt the nearness of death can truly be grateful for each new day, no matter how much suffering it might bring.” 
<p>Thus speaks Maria Linke, survivor of nine years' imprisonment in the death camps and prisons of Stalin's Russia following World War II. There have been many “God is faithful amid the horrors of war” stories, and although East Wind fits this description, it is far more than just another war story. The unusual aspects of Maria's life make this book so arrestingly different. The winsome portrait of a childhood lived on the banks of the Volga River as the daughter of a wealthy pre-Revolution German industrialist . . . The tragedy of banishment to Siberia and life among the nomadic tribes there . . . The flight from a burning Cossack village and escape to Germany during the Russian Revolution . . . Teen years in lively Berlin . . . World War II and her work as an interpreter in the labor camps of Germany . . . Her arrest as a spy by the advancing Russian armies . . . Miraculous escapes from death . . . Romance . . . The infamous Waldeheim trials . . . And transcending it all, the rare sense of humor that could find laughter in the most horrible of circumstances.</p>
<p>East Wind is a powerful book. Historically, its scope is broad. Spiritually, its impact is tremendous. It will be a long time before you find another story that will move you as much as Maria's. From the Publisher: First published in 1976 as a hardcover, The Berean Call is pleased to present this new facsimile of the 1987 paperback edition, with a special commemorative cover design utilizing authentic historical images (see photo section inside book).</p>
<p>As an apologetics and discernment ministry, TBC encourages the broadcasting and defense of the true Gospel of Christ worldwide and seeks to support the modern persecuted church around the globe. It is our conviction that this true account must be kept in print not only as an inspirational testimony to the faithfulness of God but also as a matter of valuable historical record to the generations unfamiliar with the trials of World War II. We are grateful to Ruth Hunt for the opportunity to preserve this valuable literary work, and we present it as a true Christian classic for edification, enrichment, and enjoyment.</p>
<p>From the back cover: Nine years in a Soviet prison camp would seem an eternity to most of us. For Maria, it was an investment in eternity. This is the true story of Maria Zeitner Linke—a story of survival and courage in the death camps of Stalin's Gulag after World War II. But more than that, it is the story of how one woman turned her sorrow into an opportunity for growth, ministry, and strengthened commitment to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In nine years, Maria moved through six different camps, including the infamous Buchenwald, which the Soviets had taken over from the Nazis after the war. In the process, Maria touched the lives of many people and helped them turn their own mourning into dancing. This book, which will remind many readers of the works of Corrie ten Boom and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, offers encouragement and hope to anyone who has ever wondered, “How would I react if my faith were really put to the test?” It comes to terms with the true meaning of “practicing patience in tribulation.”</p>
<p>Maria Zeitner Linke was born in Russia in 1908 to German parents and spent six years of her childhood in the rugged work camps of Siberia. She came to the United States in 1957 and became a citizen in 1963. She died of cancer in 1978.</p>

Twilight of the Gods was originally written in Swedish, and published in Buenos Aires shortly after the end of WWII. Erik Wallin, a Swedish soldier who volunteered for service with the Waffen-SS, and participated in the climactic battles on the Eastern Front during late 1944 and 1945, later telling his story to this book's editor, Thorolf Hillblad.<br>
<br>
Wallin served with the Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion, 11th SS-Panzergrenadier Division Nordland, a unit composed mainly of non-German volunteers, including Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. The division enjoyed a high reputation for its combat capability, and was always at the focal points of the fighting on the Eastern Front in the last year of the war. During this period it saw combat in the Baltic, in Pomerania, on the Oder, and finally in defence of Berlin, where it was destroyed.<br>
<br>
Erik Wallin served with his unit in all of these locations, and provides the reader with a fascinating glimpse into these final battles. The book is written with a 'no holds barred' approach which will captivate, excite and maybe even shock the reader - his recollections do not evade the brutality of fighting against the advancing Red Army. Twilight of the Gods is destined to become a classic memoir of the Second World War. <br>"

9781906868659,Sweet Home: Over 100 Heritage Desserts And Ideas For Preserving Family Recipes,['Rebecca Miller Ffrench'],"Food writer and stylist Rebecca Ffrench comes from a long line of dessert lovers. She fondly remembers the special bonding time her grandparents had over dessert. The smell of fresh baked brownies transports her back into her mother’s kitchen where there was always some kind of foil-covered treat waiting on the counter. And, even today, she rarely lets the week go by without baking something for her family. Just as she remembers her mother’s warm, chocolatey pudding cake more fondly than her Monday meatloaf, Rebecca wants her own kids’ memories of dessert to be equally vivid. It was this very sense of nostalgia for these family heirloom recipes that planted the seeds for her first cookbook. After the loss of a beloved aunt, Rebecca came into possession of the aunt’s journal. It turned out that this journal was not only filled with memories but also a lifetime of recipes—recipes that would have been lost had they not been recorded and passed on. This inspired Rebecca to begin recording her family’s history and heritage through cakes and cookies, pies and puddings, tarts and treats, and in this book, she includes more than 75 of her family’s favorite “I’m home!” treats, from an ooey-gooey “Go-To” Hot Fudge Pudding Cake to a moist, dense Coconut Bunny Cake that Rebecca’s dad perfected to please his granddaughters. Any recipe you pick from her list sounds lush and tempting: Love Struck Sour Cherry Pie, Norwegian Custard Buns, Spiced Apple Cider Doughnuts, No-Fail Caramel Sauce, Criss-Cross Apricot Coffeecake—the list goes deliciously on and on. Broken down into Preserving, Celebrating, Giving, and Creating, SWEET HOME teaches readers not only how to make delectable desserts, but how to keep your family’s traditions alive. Whether she’s preserving her Norwegian heritage by making Cloudberry Krumkaker Cones, celebrating Halloween with a Spooktacular Cheesecake, giving Kahlua Pound Cake through the post, or creating a new family tradition by making her father’s Chocolate Mudslide Cookies, Rebecca Miller Ffrench shows you how easy—and delicious—it is to make your home a sweet one. Add in the warm and winning headnotes on family and baking, tips to make each dish a success, and a special Baking Notes and Pantry section, and SWEET HOME is a recipe for a dessert classic—the perfect go-to guide for families wanting to preserve their history through recipes and food."

9781931082792,"Novels And Stories, 1959-1962 (library Of America)",['Philip Roth'],"For the last half century, the novels of Philip Roth have re-energized American fiction and redefined its possibilities. Roth's comic genius, his imaginative daring, his courage in exploring uncomfortable truths, and his assault on political, cultural, and sexual orthodoxies have made him one of the essential writers of our time. By special arrangement with the author, The Library of America now inaugurates the definitive edition of Roth's collected works. This first volume presents <i>Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories</i>, the book that established Roth's reputation on publication in 1959 and for which he won the National Book Award, and his first novel, <i>Letting Go</i> (1962).
<p>The title novella, <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>, the story of a summer romance between a poor young man from Newark and a rich Radcliffe co-ed, is both a tightly wrought tale of youthful desire and a satiric gem that takes aim at the comfortable affluence of the postwar boom. Here and in the stories that accompany it, including ""The Conversion of the Jews"" and ""Defender of the Faith,"" Roth depicts Jewish lives in 1950s America with an unflinching sharpness of observation.</p>
<p>In <i>Letting Go</i>, a sprawling novel set largely against the backdrop of Chicago in the 1950s, Roth portrays the moral dilemmas of young people cast precipitously into adulthood, and in the process describes a skein of social and family responsibilities as they are brought into focus by issues of marriage, abortion, adoption, friendship, and career. The novel's expansiveness provides a wide scope for Roth's gift for vivid characterization, and in his protagonist Gabe Wallach he creates a nuanced portrait of a responsive young academic whose sense of morality draws him into the ordeals of others with unforeseen consequences.</p>"

In Me and My Hair you’ll hear the voices of women from around Britain talking about their hair - whether it’s their longing to have ‘Shirley Temple’ curls, the visits of the nit nurse, their first home perm, roasting under hood dryers, going platinum blonde, hilarious experiments with hair extensions, or fears of going grey."

Born with a platinum spoon in her mouth thanks to her drug-dealing parents, Fancy is a young, spoiled princess. But when havoc enters the picture and the Feds seize her family's ill-gotten gains, Fancy's lavish Caribbean trips are traded in for cold winter nights in the heart of the hood.

Unwilling to stay down, Fancy realizes that she was born to hustle, and this American Gangstress is reborn. What emerges is a fierce contender the streets aren't ready for."

This is a history book of sorts, but with a twist. It is a view of the past twenty-five years through the eyes of an editorial cartoonist, with text used to illuminate the cartoons. It begins in Vietnam and waning years of the Nixon administration, the launching point of a thousand cartoon careers, and ends in the current war in Iraq. 
<p>This book looks at many issues, (the economy, military spending, race relations, religion, and culture) which have remained issues over the last 25 years and seven presidents, they simply increase and decrease over time.</p>
<p> One of the lessons drawn from this effort is that nothing ever gets resolved. All the big questions keep coming back in one form or another, making for an interesting reading.</p>"

To coincide with this the memoirs of one of its test pilots, Tony Blackman, was published to great acclaim. Now the first book about test flying this monumental delta-wing aircraft which dominated the history of the late 20th century is available in paperback. <br>
<br>
Tony is the ideal man to write such a tale as he flew no less than 105 of the 136 built, logging 850 flights at over 1,327 hours. His book describes in layman's terms what it was like to tame the first prototypes and to master the unusual characteristics necessitated by the Vulcan's shape. <br>
<br>
Although Tony puts the developments, demonstrations, incidents and accidents in their political and historical context, his story is a highly personal one. He explains how this awesome aircraft became a national treasure and captured the imagination of the whole country. His words, descriptions and hitherto largely unpublished photographs will make people feel as he did the excitement of handling such an incredibly powerful monster always in the knowledge that he had to be in complete charge all the time as the monster could and did bite back."

9781933859217,Ironies Of Faith: The Laughter At The Heart Of Christian Literature,"['Esolen, Anthony M.']","In Ironies of Faith, celebrated Dante scholar and translator Anthony Esolen provides a profound meditation upon the use and place of irony in Christian art and in the Christian life. Esolen explores the ironies of time (for Christians believe in divine Providence, but live in a world whose moments pass away); the ironies of power (for Christians believe in an almighty God who took on human flesh, and whose ""weakness"" is stronger than death); the ironies of love (for man seldom knows whom to love, or how, or even whom it is that in the depths of his heart he loves best); and the figure of the Child (for Christians believe that unless we become like unto one of these little ones, we shall not enter the Kingdom of God).
<p>This finely wrought study draws from Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare, Tolkien, Mauriac, Milton, Herbert, Hopkins, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky, among others, including the anonymous author of the medieval poem Pearl. Such authors, Anthony Esolen believes, teach us that the last laugh is on the world, because that grim old world, taking itself so seriously that even its laughter is a sneer, will finally-despite its proud resistance-be redeemed. That is the ultimate irony of faith.</p>"
9781931082006,Dashiell Hammett: Crime Stories And Other Writings (library Of America),['Dashiell Hammett'],"In the stories and novellas he wrote for Black Mask and other pulp magazines in the 1920s and 1930s, Dashiell Hammett took the detective story and turned it into a medium for capturing the jarring textures and revved-up cadences of modern American life. In this volume, The Library of America collects the finest of these stories: 24 in all, along with some revealing essays and an earlier version of his novel The Thin Man.
<p>Mixing melodramatic panache and poker-faced comedy, a sensitivity to place and a perceptive grasp of social conflict, Hammett's stories are hard-edged entertainments for an era of headlong change and extravagant violence. For the heroic sagas of earlier eras Hammett substituted the up-tempo, devious, sometimes nearly nihilistic exploits of con men and blackmailers, fake spiritualists and thieving politicians, slumming socialites and deadpan assassins.</p>
<p>As a guide through this underworld he created the Continental Op, the nameless, laconic detective, world-weary and unblinking, who serves as protagonist of most of these stories. The deliberately unheroic Op is separated only by his code of professionalism from the brutality and corruption that run rampant in stories such as ""Zigzags of Treachery,"" ""Dead Yellow Women,"" ""Fly Paper,"" and ""$106,000 Blood Money.""</p>
<p> Hammett's years of experience as a Pinkerton detective give even his most outlandishly plotted mysteries a gritty credibility, and his intimate knowledge of San Francisco made him the perfect chronicler of that city's waterfronts, back alleys, police stations, and luxury hotels. By connecting crime fiction to the realities of American streets and American speech, his Black Mask stories opened up new vistas for generations of writers and readers.</p>"
9781931885881,Memories Of The Southern Civil Rights Movement By Danny Lyon (2010) Hardcover,['Danny Lyon'],"In the summer of 1962, Danny Lyon, a twenty-year-old University of Chicago history student, packed a Nikon Reflex and an old Leica in an army bag and hitch-hiked south. Within a week he was in jail in Albany, Georgia, looking through the bars at another prisoner, Martin Luther King, Jr. Lyon soon became the first staff photographer for the Atlanta-based Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which already had a reputation as one of the most committed and confrontational groups fighting for civil rights. In Memories of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, Lyon tells the compelling story of how a handful of dedicated young people, both black and white, forged one of the most successful grassroots organizations in American history. In addition to his own photographs, Lyon includes here a selection of historic SNCC documents such as press releases, telephone logs, letters, and minutes of meetings. This combination of pictures, contemporary eyewitness reports, and text creates both a work of art and an authentic work of history. As SNCC's staff photographer, Danny Lyon was present at some of the most violent and dramatic moments of civil rights history: Black Monday in Danville, Virginia; the aftermath of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the March on Washington in 1963; the violent winters of 1963 and 1964 in Atlanta; and the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. But Lyon's photographs are more than just a record of marches, jailings, and protests. They take us inside the movement - to the meetings, organizing work, and voter registration drives that were the less visible but no less important side of the struggle. By the time Danny Lyon left SNCC and the South in 1964, there was an emerging focus on black consciousness in the organization. The movement was changing course and pointing North. Many people have since forgotten the idealistic and truly multiracial character of the movement's early years. Lyon's pictures, taken d

9781933633336,Biting The Wax Tadpole: Confessions Of A Language Fanatic,"['Little, Elizabeth , 1981-']","In this decidedly unstuffy look at the staid world of languages, Elizabeth Little uses her favorite examples from languages dead, difficult, and just plain made-up to reveal how language study is the ticket to traveling the world—without leaving the comforts of home. Little’s exploration of “word travel” includes:
<p>• Shona, a language lacking distinct words for “blue” or “green”<br>
• Why Icelandic speakers must decide if the numbers 1-4 are plural<br>
• Which language is the only one lacking verbs<br>
• Just what, exactly, the Swedish names of IKEA products mean</p>
<p>Fully illustrated with hilarious sidebars, <i>Biting The Wax Tadpole</i> also addresses classic cases of mistranslation. For example, when Chinese shopkeepers tried to find a phonetic written equivalent of Coca-Cola, one set of characters they chose were pronounced “ke-kou ke-la.” It sounded right, but it translated literally as “bite the wax tadpole.” Not quite what Coke had in mind, but in this off-kilter ode to the words of the world, it’s just another example of language taking you someplace interesting.</p>"

In 1944 W. H. Auden called Agee's film reviews for <i>The Nation</i> ""the most remarkable regular event in American journalism today."" Those columns, along with much of the movie criticism that Agee wrote for <i>Time</i> through most of the 1940s, were collected posthumously in <i>Agee on Film: Reviews and Comments</i>, undoubtedly the most influential writings on film by an American.
<p>Whether reviewing a Judy Garland musical or a wartime documentary, assessing the impact of Italian neorealism or railing against the compromises in a Hollywood adaptation of Hemingway, Agee always wrote of movies as a pervasive, profoundly significant part of modern life, a new art whose classics (Chaplin, Dovzhenko, Vigo) he revered and whose betrayal in the interests of commerce or propaganda he often deplored. If his frequent disappointments could be registered in acid tones, his enthusiasms were expressed with passionate eloquence. This Library of America volume supplements the classic pieces from <i>Agee on Film</i> with previously uncollected writings on Ingrid Bergman, the Marx Brothers, Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Lifeboat</i>, Vittorio De Sica's <i>Shoeshine</i>, and a wealth of other cinematic subjects.</p>
<p>Agee's own work as a screenwriter is represented by his script for Charles Laughton's unique and haunting masterpiece of Southern gothic, <i>The Night of the Hunter</i>, adapted from the novel by Davis Grubb. This collection also includes examples of Agee's masterfully probing reporting for <i>Fortune</i>—on subjects as diverse as the Tennessee Valley Authority, commercial orchids, and cockfighting—and a sampling of his literary reviews, among them appreciations of William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, S. J. Perelman, and William Carlos Williams.</p>"

An historical document of unprecedented worth, <i>Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits</i> includes almost 100 portraits taken from 1905 through 1920.

<p>Dr. Kawashima, a prominent neurologist in Japan, developed this program of daily simple math calculations that can help boost your brain power, improve your memory, and stave off the mental effects of aging. The exercises in this book have even been shown to help those suffering from Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The idea, Dr. Kawashima says, is to ""work out the brain much like we work out the rest of our bodies. It has long been known that regular exercise helps slow the deterioration of our muscles, and the same is true for our brains.""</p>
<p><i>From the Author</i></p>
<p>""I have developed a program of keeping your brain young that consists of a daily program of simple calculations. It may sound too simple to be true, but my research has shown that this activity increases regional cerebral blood flow to the largest portions of the brain and stimulates the creation of neural pathways.</p>
<p>We all age, and it is only natural that our brains age too. The good news is that mental decline is not inevitable. We can keep our bodies younger and healthier through regular exercise. The same is true for the brain - if you exercise your brain, you can prevent your cerebral function from deteriorating.</p>

9781931082808,Philip Roth: Novels 1967-1972: When She Was Good / Portnoy's Complaint / Our Gang / The Breast (library Of America),['Philip Roth'],"This second volume presents four extraordinarily diverse works displaying the range and originality of his fictional art.
<p><i>When She Was Good</i> (1967) is the trenchant portrait of Lucy Nelson, a young midwestern woman whose perception of her own suffering turns her into a ferocious force, ""enemy-ridden and unforgivingly defiant,"" as Roth would later describe her. A small-town 1940s America of restrictive social pressures and foreclosed opportunities provides the novel's background.</p>
<p>The publication of the hilarious <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i> (1969) was a cultural event that turned Roth into a reluctant celebrity. The confession of a bewildered psychoanalytic patient thrust through life by his unappeasable sexuality yet held back by the iron grip of his unforgettable childhood, Portnoy unleashed Roth's comic virtuosity and opened new avenues for American fiction.</p>
<p>In <i>Our Gang</i> (1971), described by Anthony Burgess as a ""brilliant satire in the real Swift tradition,"" Roth effects a savage takedown of the administration of Richard Nixon (who figures here as Trick E. Dixon). Written before the revelations of the Watergate scandal, <i>Our Gang</i> continues to resonate as a broad and outraged response to the clownish hypocrisy and moral theatrics of the American political scene.</p>
<p>The Kafkaesque excursion <i>The Breast</i> (1972) introduces David Kepesh in the first volume of a trilogy that continues with <i>The Professor of Desire</i> (1977) and <i>The Dying Animal</i> (2001). <i>The Breast</i> prompted Cynthia Ozick to remark, ""One knows when one is reading something that will permanently enter the culture.""</p>"

Early stories such as ""The Outsider,"" ""The Music of Erich Zann,"" ""Herbert West - Reanimator,"" and ""The Lurking Fear"" demonstrate Lovecraft's uncanny ability to blur the distinction between reality and nightmare, sanity and madness, the human and the non-human. ""The Horror at Red Hook"" and ""He"" reveal the fascination and revulsion Lovecraft felt for New York City; ""Pickman's Model"" uncovers the frightening secret behind an artist's work; ""The Rats in the Walls"" is a terrifying descent into atavistic horror; and ""The Colour Out of Space"" explores the eerie impact of a meteorite on a remote Massachusetts valley."
9781931788601,Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits 1905-1920,"['Augustus F. Sherman', 'Peter Mesenholler']","Throughout his tenure as a registry clerk with the Immigration Division of Ellis Island, Augustus F. Sherman systematically photographed more than 200 families, groups, and individuals while they were being held by customs for special investigations. This volume collects and provides an essential revaluation of Sherman's striking portraits, which predate August Sander's cataloging efforts by several years. A historical document of unprecedented worth, <i>Augustus F. Sherman: Ellis Island Portraits</i> includes almost one-hundred portraits taken from 1905 through 1920. The subjects are frequently dressed in elaborate national costumes or folk dress, emphasizing the variety and richness of the cultural heritage that came together to form the United States. Romanian shepherds, German stowaways, Russian vegetarians, Greek priests, and Ghanaian women in elaborately patterned dresses, are treated with equal gravitas. The resulting body of work presents a unique and powerful picture of the stream of immigrants who came through Ellis Island. In its time, the material contributed to the larger project of ethnographic categorization and typology typical of the early twentieth century, much as Edward S. Curtis's portraits romanticized the last Indians or John Thomson's Street Life in London identified and codified social class in the late 1800s. Though originally taken for his own personal study, Sherman's work appeared in the public eye as illustrations for publications with titles such as Alien or American, and hung on the walls of the custom offices as cautionary or exemplary models of the new American species. <br> <br>In this book, Peter Mesenh ller, Research Associate with theRautenstrauch-Joest-Museum of Anthropology in Cologne, Germany, provides new critical context and analysis of this rich collection, but also addresses the individual images as powerful, engaging photographs created by a master portraitist. <br> <br>The publication is accompanied by a traveling exhibition that will open at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum in the summer of 2005."

After serving with distinction during the Mexican War, Grant found that postwar army life would not earn him enough money to care for his family. Seven years later, Grant returned to uniform with the outbreak of the Civil War. His willingness to fight, his organizational skills, and his bravery won him rapid promotion. He led several crucial campaigns in the West, culminating in the decisive capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863. President Lincoln then appointed him as the army's supreme commander. After months of bitter fighting, Grant accepted Confederate general Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. Grant was elected president in 1868 and served two terms. After leaving office, Grant died in 1885, just days after finishing his memoir. Ulysses S. Grant: Defender of the Union explores his life and his complex time for a new generation of readers."
