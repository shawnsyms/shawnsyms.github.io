Wilderness Forever: Howard Zahniser And The Path To The Wilderness Act (weyerhaeuser Environmental Books),['Mark W. T. Harvey'],"""As a central figure in the American wilderness preservation movement in the mid-twentieth century, Howard Zahniser (1906-1964) was the person most responsible for the landmark Wilderness Act of 1964. While the rugged outdoorsmen of the early environmental movement, such as John Muir and Bob Marshall, gave the cause a charismatic face, Zahniser strove to bring conservations' concerns into the public eye and the preservationists' plans to fruition. In many fights to save besieged wild lands, he pulled together fractious coalitions, built grassroots support networks, wooed skittish and truculent politicians, and generated streams of eloquent prose celebrating wilderness."" ""Zahniser worked for the Bureau of Biological Survey (a precursor to the Fish and Wildlife Service) and the Department of the Interior, wrote for Nature magazine, and eventually managed the Wilderness Society and edited its magazine, Living Wilderness. The culmination of his wilderness writing and political lobbying was the Wilderness Act of 1964. All of its drafts included his eloquent definition of wilderness, which still serves as a central tenet for the Wilderness Society: ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" The bill was finally signed into law shortly after his death."" Pervading his tireless work was a deeply held belief in the healing powers of nature for a humanity ground down by the mechanized hustle-bustle of modern, urban life. Zahniser grew up in a family of Methodist ministers, and although he moved away from any specific denomination, a spiritual outlook informed his thinking about wilderness. His love of nature was not so much a result of scientific curiosity as a sense of wonder at its beauty and majesty, and a wish to exist in harmony with all other living things. In this deeply researched and affectionate portrait, Mark Harvey brings to life this great leader of environmental activism."
Reading Freud: Explorations And Entertainments,['Peter Gay'],"""As every biographer of Freud must ruefully acknowledge, Freud, that great unriddler of mysteries, left behind some intriguing private mysteries of his own. It was because I hoped to solve some of these mysteries that the stratagem of finding my way to Freud by indirections commended itself to me."" -Peter Gay In this book, the eminent cultural historian and Freud scholar Peter Gay presents a series of essays in which he tries to ""reduce the blank spots on the map we now have of Freud's mind."" Engaging as well as illuminating, the essays range from reflections on Freud and Shakespeare to Gay's controversial spoof review of Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams.<br>
The book begins with ""Freud and the Man from Stratford,"" in which Gay describes Freud's fascination with the theory that the Earl of Oxford was the real author of the plays attributed to Shakespeare and speculates on the reasons for Freud's belief. ""Six Names in Search of an interpretation"" considers Freud's choices of names for his six children and what they revealed about his Jewishness, his love of science, and his ambivalent feelings toward his father. ""Freud on Freedom"" deals with the issue of determinism and free will in Freud's work. ""Reading Freud through Freud's Reading"" analyzes ten ""good"" books Freud identified in response to a questionnaire. <br>
The second half of the book, entitled ""Entertainments,"" includes an essay on ""Serious Jests"" that cites some vintage Jewish jokes frequently recounted by Freud and points out how these chestnuts illustrate not only psychoanalytic concepts but the anti-Semitism that permeated Freud's Vienna; the ""review"" of The Interpretation of Dreams, published in Harper's in 1981; ""A Gentile Science?"" which is a ""report"" on the work of one Sigmund Oberhufer, a fictitious Austrian doctor said to have ""invented"" psychoanalysis; and ""The Dog That Did Not Bark in the Night,"" Gay's account of the newly accessible correspondence between Freud and his sister-in-law Minna Bernays, who some writers claim was his lover. The essays, some of them published for the first time or expanded from their original versions, are accompanied by informative introductions."

"Resurrection, A War Journey: A Chronicle Of Events During And Following The Attack On Fort Jeanne D'arc At Metz, France, By F Company Of The 379th Regiment Of The 95th Infantry Division, November 14-21, 1944","['Gajdusek, Robert E.']","""Before us, several thousand yards of open fields...we were to cross, and historically, the great cavalry battlefields of several remote and now absurd wars."" For Robert E. Gajdusek, these fields represent the first step toward resurrection as he retrieves a lost personal past through a writing catharsis which refocuses the vast battlefields of history into a singular voice. Resurrection is Gajdusek's dramatic account of a single week in mid-November 1944 which has taken him more than fifty years to wrestle into words. Part of Patton's Third Army in World War II, Gajdusek's unit was chosen to spearhead the first assault on the impenetrable fortifications of Metz, France, held by the Germans. Uniquely structured, Resurrection intertwines a variety of narrative forms to give voice to experience. Gajdusek's war memories awaken in his own poetry, short stories, discursive reflections, and sometimes abortive essays, as well as in borrowed historical fragments. Resurrection is a strong anti-war statement stemming from the only honest indicator, personal experience."
Virginia Woolf: Becoming A Writer,['Katherine Dalsimer'],"""By the time she was twenty-four, Virginia Woolf had suffered a series of devastating losses that later she would describe as ""sledge-hammer blows,"" beginning with the death of her mother when she was thirteen years old and followed by those of her half-sister, father, and brother. Yet vulnerable as she was (""skinless"" was her word) she began, through these years, to practice her art - and to discover how it could serve her. Ultimately, she came to feel that it was her ""shock-receiving capacity"" that had made her a writer."" ""Astonishingly gifted from the start, Woolf learned to be attentive to the movements of her own mind. Through self-reflection she found a language for the ebb and flow of thought, fantasy, feeling and memory, for the shifts of light and dark. And in her writing she preserved, recreated and altered the dead, altering in the process her internal relationship with their ""invisible presence."" ""I will go backwards &amp; forwards"" she remarked in her diary, a comment on both her imaginative and writerly practice."" Following Woolf's lead, psychologist Katherine Dalsimer moves backward and forward between the work of Woolf's maturity and her early journals, letters, and published juvenilia to illuminate the process by which Woolf became a writer. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory as well as on Woolf's life and work, and trusting Woolf's own self-observations, Dalsimer offers a compelling account of a young artist's voyage out - a voyage that Virginia Woolf began by looking inward and completed by looking back."
Law And War: An American Story,"['Maguire, Peter (peter H.)']","""During the twentieth century, the United States attempted to redefine war crimes to include acts previously considered beyond the realm of objective judgment, and to determine appropriate punishments. This movement to replace blind vengeance with law culminated with the Nuremberg trials, one of the great historical dramas of modern times.""--BOOK JACKET."
Early Education And Psychological Development,['Barbara Biber'],"""Everyone who is concerned about the early years of development in children will find Dr. Biber's book, Early Education and Psychological Development intensely absorbing. It is a fascinating sharing of her experience as a major leader in early education over more than a half-century, at a time when implications of Dewey's thought, and that of Freud, Watson, Piaget were enriching and stimulating the thinking of educators and leaders in the field of child care. The intimate autobiographical context of her historical, psychological, and philosophical discussion plunges the reader into the very process of discovering new awarenesses of the complexity of child development. This is a unique book: it will be a classic, to give perspective to the present generation and those to follow.""-Lois Barclay Murphy<br>
<br>
""In this marvelous book, we have a record of the evolution of Barbara Biber's thinking on early childhood education and the personal, scientific, and intellectual forces which shaped her thought....It will be obvious to all who read this book why Biber has long been regarded as the premier worker in the field of early childhood education.""-Edward Zigler, from the Foreword<br>
<br>
""No other volume in the literature of early education brings together the reflections of an outstanding leader as they have developed over a period that is almost equivalent to the history of the field....A richly detailed and intimate picture of the construction of a knowledge base for the education of young children.""-Millie Almy, American Journal of Education"
"An American Theatre (deluxe Box Edition): The Story Of Westport Country Playhouse, 1931-2005",['Richard Somerset-ward'],"""For seventy-five years Westport Country Playhouse has faithfully reflected the story of American theatre. Founded by Lawrence and Armina Langner in 1931, it has never been more than a summer stock theatre, yet it has an astonishing pedigree. George Bernard Shaw and Noel Coward gave world premieres there; so did Leonard Gershe and A. R. Gurney in more recent times. Playwrights Eugene O'Neill and S. N. Behrman were closely linked to it, and talents as diverse as Jane Wyatt, Gene Kelly, Stephen Sondheim, and Liza Minnelli performed there early in their careers. The aristocracy of the acting profession and the giants of Hollywood appeared - Ethel Barrymore, Helen Hayes, Paul Robeson, Groucho Marx, Tyrone Power, Olivia de Havilland. And the Playhouse can claim a role in the creation of two of the American theatre's greatest musicals - Oklahoma! and My Fair Lady."" This illustrated book traces the entire story of Westport Country Playhouse from its beginnings in the midst of the Depression to its seventy-fifth anniversary renovations and rejuvenation. Filled with colorful characters and lively anecdotes, it is a story that will appeal to everyone who has ever been enchanted by the magic of a live theatre performance."
Beyond Earth Day: Fulfilling The Promise,"['Gaylord Nelson', 'Paul A. Wozniak', 'Susan M. Campbell']","""Gaylord Nelson is known and respected throughout the world as a founding father of the modern environmental movement and creator of Earth Day, the most influential public awareness campaign ever undertaken on behalf of global stewardship."" ""Now in the twilight of his career, Nelson offers guidance to a new generation. With the same eloquence that rallied the public more than thirty years ago, he details today's most crucial environmental concerns - from species and habitat losses to global climate change and population growth. Ever hopeful, Nelson outlines a compelling strategy for the planet and inspires citizens to reassert the environment as a national priority."" A book for anyone who cares deeply about our environment and wants to know what we can and must do now to save it. Beyond Earth Day is a classic guide by one of the natural world's great defenders."
Meadows Of Memory: Images Of Time And Tradition In American Art And Culture (anne Burnett Tandy Lectures In American Civilization),['Michael Kammen'],"""History painting,"" for many people, conjures up Washington Crossing the Delaware and other paintings of heroic historical events. But history has made its way into considerably more American art than such obvious examples, in the view of Michael Kammen. In three thought-provoking and innovative essays, Kammen ranges from the Renaissance to the twentieth century, from central Europe to the western United States, and from elegant oil painting to folk sculpture to show the transformations of Old World icons of time into New World images of social memory and tradition. In the first essay, Kammen demonstrates how American artists and artisans modified European emblems of time in response to their New World setting. In the second essay concerning nineteenth-century landscape art, he explores how artists used space to represent the movement of American culture through time. In the final essay, he looks at two distinctively American motifs of collective memory and tradition--old houses and elm trees. Throughout this interdisciplinary study, Kammen draws his examples from well-known and lesser-known artists, as well as from diverse American writers. Over 100 black-and-white illustrations accompany the text. Of interest to all students of American culture, Meadows of Memory raises intriguing questions about the American paradox of desiring to conquer mutability while yearning for emblems of a (perhaps imagined?) past."
"Frankly, My Dear: Gone With The Wind Revisited (icons Of America)",['Molly Haskell'],"""How and why has the saga of Scarlett O'Hara kept such a tenacious hold on our national imagination for almost three-quarters of a century? In the first book ever to deal simultaneously with Margaret Mitchell's beloved novel and David Selznick's spectacular film version of Gone with the Wind, film critic Molly Haskell seeks the answers. By all industry predictions, the film should never have worked. What makes it work so amazingly well are the fascinating and uncompromising personalities that Haskell dissects here: Margaret Mitchell, David Selznick, and Vivien Leigh. As a feminist and onetime Southern adolescent, Haskell understands how the story takes on different shades of meaning according to the age and eye of the beholder. She explores how it has kept its edge because of Margaret Mitchell's (and our) ambivalence about Scarlett and because of the complex racial and sexual attitudes embedded in a story that at one time or another has offended almost everyone."" Haskell imaginatively weaves together disparate strands, conducting her story as her own inner debate between enchantment and disenchantment. Sensitive to the ways in which history and cinema intersect, she reminds us why these characters, so riveting to Depression audiences, continue to fascinate 70 years later."
In The Company Of Scholars: The Struggle For The Soul Of Higher Education,['Julius Getman'],"""I began this book to articulate my sense of disappointment and alienation from the status I had fought so hard to achieve."" A remarkable admission from an alumnus of Harvard Law School who has held tenured professorships in the law schools of Yale and Stanford and has taught in the law schools of Harvard and Chicago. In this personal reflection on the status of higher education, Julius Getman probes the tensions between status and meaning, elitism and egalitarianism, that challenge the academy and academics today. He shows how higher education creates a shared intellectual community among people of varied classes and races - while simultaneously dividing people on the basis of education and status. In the course of his explorations, Getman touches on many of the most current issues in higher education today, including the conflict between teaching and research, challenges to academic freedom, the struggle over multiculturalism, and the impact of minority and feminist activism. Getman presents these issues through relevant, often humorous anecdotes, using his own and others' experiences in coping with the constantly changing academic landscape. Written from a liberal perspective, the book offers another side of the story told in such recent works as Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind and Roger Kimball's Tenured Radicals. It will be important reading for everyone concerned with the future of higher education, as well as for anyone considering an academic career."
"Yale French Studies, Number 91: Genet: In The Language Of The Enemy (yale French Studies Series)",['Scott Durham'],"""I couldn't change the world alone, I could only pervert it: that is what I attempted by a corruption of language, that is to say from within this French language that appears so noble."" It is in these terms that Jean Genet describes his ambiguous role in the French literary canon: that of an enemy within, one who puts the monuments and forms of the dominant culture in promiscuous contact with marginal languages and practices in a ""war of words."" This volume investigates the stakes and boundaries of this war for Genet and for his readers, offering new interpretations of his works and showing how they oblige us to rethink our own relations, as readers and interpreters, to literature itself."
"Young, Poor, And Pregnant: The Psychology Of Teenage Motherhood",['Judith S. Musick'],"""I like it when people notice I'm having a baby. It gives me a good feeling inside and makes me feel important.""-a teenage mother
<p>Teenage mothers are often poor young girls who define themselves through motherhood and who see getting pregnant as less frightening than finishing school or getting a job. In this book an expert on adolescent pregnancy discusses how psychological pressures of adolescence interact with the problems of being poor to create a situation in which early sexuality, pregnancy, and childbearing-often repeated childbearing-seem almost inevitable. Drawing on her experience as founding director of one of the nation's largest and most successful programs for teenage mothers, Judith Musick sheds new light on what is required to significantly improve the life chances of teenage mothers and their children.</p>
<p>Frequently quoting from the diaries of teenage mothers themselves, Musick looks at the family and community problems that accompany poverty and shows how they influence the psychological development of young girls, examines the sexual socialization (and exploitation) of disadvantaged females, and analyzes the role played by mother-daughter relationships. She describes how adolescents feel about and raise their children. Musick concludes by recommending strategies for intervention programs that will help promote the developmental, psychological, and environmental conditions necessary for teenage mothers to change their lives.</p>"
My Body: Women Speak Out About Their Health Care,"['Crook, Marion , 1941-']","""I want to stay in charge of my health. I want to make the decisions."" This is the overwhelming sentiment of all women who are looking for ways to find vital information about their health care choices. In other times and cultures, women were the healers and doctors of their communities, exchanging information and building on their knowledge. During the Middle Ages, however, much of the wisdom and health information that women had acquired became the property of a patriarchal scientific establishment that disregarded and neglected them. In many ways, this is still the case for women who need to obtain information crucial to their health. Is the modern medical community fulfilling their long-neglected needs? Are their health problems taken seriously? What would they like to change about this system? My Body: Women Speak Out about Their Health Care is a provocative response to these questions as well as an acute examination of the tenuous role of women within today's health care system. Ms. Marion Crook, an esteemed health writer/researcher and community health care nurse, presents compelling interviews with women from various ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds in the United States and Canada that explore; how they obtained medical information; their experiences using different kinds of medicine - western, alternative, ethnic based, or a combination thereof; their struggles to realize the role of health and illness in their lives. The author gives specific advice on how women can obtain not only useful health information but also respect and emotional support from a physician. From her years of nursing experience, Ms. Crook has extraordinary insight into the way in which women use or are used by the health care systems in the United States and Canada and projects what they can do to implement change in local health care facilities. This book will enable women of all ages and cultural backgrounds to educate and empower themselves in every aspect of their health

                        <p>Based on interviews w/women from various socioeconomic &amp; ethnic backgrounds/explores how they obtained medical info.

"Tomorrow, God Willing: Self-made Destinies In Cairo",['Unni Wikan'],"""I, without earning a penny, have to be the provider!"" Thus Umm Ali sums up the nearly impossible challenge of her daily existence. Living in a poor neighborhood of Cairo, she has raised eight children with almost no help from her husband or the Egyptian government and through hardships from domestic violence to constant quarrels over material possessions.
<p>Umm Ali's story is amazing not only for what it reveals about her resourcefulness but for the light it sheds on the resilience of Cairo's poor in the face of disastrous poverty. Like countless other poor people in Cairo, she has developed a personal buoyancy to cope with relentless economic need. It stems from a belief in the ability of people to shape their own destiny and helps explain why Cairo remains virtually free of the social ills--violent street crime and homelessness--that have eroded the lives of poor people in other major cities.</p>
<p>Unni Wikan first met Umm Ali and her family twenty-five years ago and has returned almost every year. She draws on her firsthand experience of their lives to create an intimate portrait of Cairo's back streets and the people who live there. Wikan's innovative approach to ethnographic writing reads like a novel that presents the experiences of Umm Ali's family and neighbors in their own words.</p>
<p>As Umm Ali recounts triumphs and defeats--from forming a savings club with neighbors to the gradual drifting away and eventual return of her husband--she unveils a deeply reflective attitude and her unwavering belief that she can improve her situation. Showing how Egyptian culture interprets poverty and family, this book attests to the capacity of an individual's self-worth to withstand incredible adversity.</p>"
Political Innovation In America: The Politics Of Policy Initiation,['Nelson W. Polsby'],"""In his recognition of the importance of ideas and institutions in politics, in his limited use of the jargon of political analysis, and in his evident wit and ready humor, Nelson Polsby is himself being innovative in this study of the policy process. Political Innovation In America is a welcome addition to the public policy literature."" -William F. Connelly, Jr., Benchmark
<p>""This book will have a significant impact in restoring the links between politics and public policy. It's safe to say that our understanding of both of these subjects will never be the same again.""-Francis E. Rourke, The Johns Hopkins University</p>"
The Earth's Blanket: Traditional Teachings For Sustainable Living,"['Turner, Nancy J. , 1947-']","""In The Earth's Blanket, ethnobotanist Nancy Turner explores the wealth of ecological knowledge and spiritual connection to the natural world that is fundamental to indigenous cultures and lifeways."" ""Turner has worked with Native peoples in the Pacific Northwest for more than thirty-five years, and generations of her indigenous teachers have given her permission to share their stories and perspectives about the natural world. Their teachings describe a rich variety of methods of harvesting, transporting, processing, storing, maintaining, and enhancing natural resources such as trees, medicinal plants, berries, root vegetables, fish, meat, and shellfish. More than just stories, these narratives underlie a belief system that informs everyday attitudes toward the earth."" The Earth's Blanket suggests how systems of traditional ecological knowledge can contribute to the modern world."
True To Life: Why Truth Matters (bradford Books),['Michael P. Lynch'],"""In this book, Michael Lynch argues that truth does matter, in both our personal and political lives. Lynch explains that the growing cynicism over truth stems in large part from our confusion over what truth is."" True to Life defends four simple claims : that truth is objective; that it is good to believe what is true; that truth is a goal worthy of inquiry; and that truth can be worth caring about for its own sake - not just because it gets us other things we want. In defense of these ""truisms about truth,"" Lynch diagnoses the sources of our cynicism and argues that many contemporary theories of truth cannot adequately account for its value. He explains why we should care about truth, arguing that truth and its pursuit are part of living a happy life, important in our personal relationships and for our political values."
Tokyo Central: A Memoir (mclellan Book),['Edward G. Seidensticker'],"""In this memoir, Seidensticker tells of his introduction to Japan at the Navy Japanese Language School in 1942, at the age of twenty-one. He recounts his formative experiences as a young diplomat during the Occupation, his early impressions of the Japanese literary scene and its stormy PEN session meetings, his encounters with luminaries such as Arthur Koestler and Edwin Reischauer, and his gradual immersion in Tokyo life."" ""He offers vivid glimpses of Japan's intellectual and political elite as it moved from the ashes of World War II through Cold War political storms in the 1950s and 1960s, when strikes and radical politics abounded, through the 1970s, when the nation's strategic and cultural alliances hardened with the United States and Europe and Japanese politics turned decisively more conservative."" Tokyo Central illuminates the translator's challenge in approaching classical and modern Japanese culture, and gives singular insight into the writing and personalities of many leading Japanese novelists."
Ariel,"['Rodó, José Enrique , 1871-1917']","""Irritating, insufferable, admirable, stimulating, disappointing Rodó: . . . you are part of our family quarrels, and must bear with your disrespectful, equally disappointed, intuitive, incomplete nephews, living in a world that you helped define for us, and offered unto our revolt.""--from the Prologue by Carlos Fuentes 
<p>First published in 1900 Uruguay, Ariel is Latin America's most famous essay on esthetic and philosophical sensibility, as well as its most discussed treatise on hemispheric relations. Though Rodó protested the interpretation, his allegorical conflict between Ariel, the lover of beauty and truth, and Caliban, the evil spirit of materialism and positivism, has come to be regarded as a metaphor for the conflicts and cultural differences between Latin America and the United States. Generations of statesmen, intellectuals, and literary figures have been formed by this book, either in championing its teachings or in reacting against them. This edition of Ariel, prepared especially with teaehers and students in mind, contains a reader's guide to names, places, and important movements, as well as notes and a comprehensive annotated English/Spanish bibliography.</p>"
The First Life Of St Francis Of Assisi,['Thomas Of Celano'],"""Leaving behind his wayward youth, the visionary and mystic Francesco Bernardone (1181-1226) embraced a life of utter poverty and, near the end of his life, received the stigmata - the marks of Christ's passion - on his body. He changed water into wine, preached to the birds, cured countless cripples, and wrestled with devils."" ""Or did he? How, after so long, can we separate history from legend?"" ""Thomas of Celano was St. Francis' friend and disciple. This new translation of his First Life is the earliest and most reliable account of a truly extraordinary man.""--BOOK JACKET."

Max Beerbohm: A Kind Of Life,"['Professor N. John Hall', 'N. John Hall']","""Max Beerbohm was widely celebrated as the wittiest mind of his age. And it was a very long age indeed: he became famous in the mid-1890s and remained so until his death in 1956. His wit manifested itself in both prose and caricature, and his writings and drawings are keenly interesting. Max's life, however, was relatively uneventful, of interest, he said, only to himself. This biography of Max, the first in forty years, enlivens his story by quoting him whenever possible, and the result - thanks to Max himself - is a scintillating and entertaining book."" This book, like Max's work, highlights his connection with various eminences over three eras: Algernon Swinburne, J. A. M. Whistler, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, George Bernard Shaw, Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf and many others. Written in an idiosyncratic, opinionated, lively, quirky style, it is just the kind of biography of which Max might have (for the most part) approved."
The Other Boston Busing Story: What`s Won And Lost Across The Boundary Line,"['Eaton', 'Susan E.']","""METCO, America's longest-running voluntary school desegregation program, has for 34 years bused black children from Boston's city neighborhoods to predominantly white suburban schools. In contrast to the infamous violence and rage of forced school busing within the city in the 1970s, METCO has quietly and calmly promoted school integration. How has this program affected the lives of its graduates? Would they choose to participate if they had it to do over again? Would they place their own children on the bus to suburbia?"" ""Sixty-five METCO graduates vividly recall their own stories in this revealing book. Susan E. Eaton interviewed program participants who are now adults, asking them to assess the benefits and hardships of crossing racial and class lines on their way to school. Their answers poignantly show that this type of racial integration is not easy - they struggled to negotiate both black and white worlds, often feeling fully accepted in neither. Even so, nearly all the participants believe the long-term gains outweighed the costs and would choose a similar program for their own children - though not without conditions and apprehensions.""--BOOK JACKET."
Mortal Coil: A Short History Of Living Longer,['David Boyd Haycock'],"""Mortal Coil explores the medical, scientific and philosophical theories behind the quest for the prolongation of human life. It was a conundrum that intrigued Sir Francis Bacon and underpinned the scientific revolution; ideas of ultimate perfectibility, indefinite progress and worldly rather than heavenly immortality fed directly into the spirit of the Enlightenment and on into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In today's world of genetic research, cryonics and nanotechnology, we still seek the same elusive philosopher's stone."" From Adam and Eve to human cloning and designer babies, from seventeenth-century lifestyle guides to science fiction, Haycock's narrative introduces an array of fascinating individuals, including Rene Descartes, Benjamin Franklin, Jonathan Swift, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud and a score of unknown figures. Full of extraordinary stories and valuable insights, this is an exploration into our unceasing desire to live forever."
The Greeks: From The Bbc Television Series By Christopher Burstall And Kenneth Dover,['Kenneth James Dover'],"""My Greeks were neither sophisticated layabouts nor pious fatalists, and least of all were they portentous gurus brooding over the lost Secrets of the Ancients. They were a resilient, sceptical, cheeky people, whose distinctive contribution to our history was to combine a readiness to ask 'Why?' and 'Why not?' with a conviction that only sane, reasoned and clearly expounded answers to those questions were worth listening to."" In this book, Kenneth Dover introduces the people and culture of ancient Greece."
Call Me Lucky,['Bing Crosby'],"""One of the most enchanting of all show—business memoirs."" —Gary Giddins.

Middle Ground,"['Macdonald, Angus , 1926-']","""Our society puts great store on 'doing.' All around us we see people working at it even when they no longer have to 'do,' as if in dread of a quiet moment that might bring them face to face with themselves. This way it is possible for a man's life to be lost to him, for him to feel at the last moment that his existence had been no more than a bullet fired point blank at the earth... Probably I am only flattering myself by imagining that my successful doing in the financial market place, that most pragmatic of institutions, was an attempt to serve my sentence as quickly as possible so as to get my doing behind me. But even then, when I was in the clutches of the need to be successful, the need to be approved of by others, to do in all things what I supposed was expected of me as son, students, husband, father, partner, citizen, there remained a secret part of me that knew that only in solitude could I find what I was looking for but had no words to define.""
<p>Angus MacDonald has found his words. His book charts a course of self-discovery, and the very act of writing it led him further to define the remembered self. This self is most emphatically defined in terms of its real connections with other people—family, friends, associates—whose memories populate his mind. And in revealing it forthrightly, he establishes a kinship with his reader, who will likely find that he privately shares many feelings that MacDonald openly expresses.</p>
<p>The outer frame of the narrative relates episodes both typical and critical stretching over half a lifetime: growing up in Baltimore in a household that was very much feeling the effects of the Depression—joining the Navy as a seaman in World War II only to be fortuitously ""shipped out"" to Harvard and then down the Charles River to M.I.T. to apprenticeship training that led to a degree in aeronautical engineering—taking a Masters degree at M.I.T. after the war and a research assistantship there—working for several years at Oak Ridge in an attempt to design a nuclear-powered rocket—a shifting from engineering to administrative problems—joining a firm specializing in negotiating corporate mergers, becoming a partner, finally establishing his own highly successful financial firm.</p>
<p>If the broad outline of this book is a classic American success story, its inner life lies in the seemingly little things, the affectionately remembered details. Things like selling shoes in the Tennessee hills, scuba diving with a daughter off Bermuda, getting to like a father-in-law, a public ass-kissing ceremony at Eliot House, Harvard.</p>
<p>And some things that can't ordinarily be seen are made vividly visible. Through an engineer's eyes we are allowed, for example, a glimpse of a nuclear reactor in operation at the atomic level and we can follow a stream of air as it twists its way through the innards of a jet engine. These descriptions impart to the nonengineer the sense of excitement felt by the makers of modern technology.</p>
<p>There are passages in the book in which MacDonald consults his own thoughts and reflections based on his experience and reading. For the most part, though, there are people around, people of all sorts. They are observed warmly but not sentimentally; the warts are there, and so are the warps of personality. Looking back, after a divorce and analysis, MacDonald is able to take the same full measure of himself, with a degree of understanding that is rarely found in today's successful American businessman.</p>"
Making The World Safe For Tourism,['Patricia Goldstone'],"""Over the past hundred years tourism has evolved into the world's biggest business, and few countries today question the common wisdom that the road to economic development is paved with tourist dollars. Yet questions should be raised, Patricia Goldstone argues in this book on the social and political impacts of tourism. She examines for the first time the close connections between business and politics as government and industry leaders work together to reengineer political trouble spots into tourist destinations in places like Ireland, Turkey, and Cuba. She also probes the impact of tourism on diverse cultures.""--BOOK JACKET."
Growing Up Brown: Memoirs Of A Filipino American (scott And Laurie Oki Series In Asian American Studies),['Peter M. Jamero'],"""Peter Jamero's story of hardship and success illuminates the experience of what he calls the ""bridge generation"" - the American-born children of the Filipinos, largely recruited as farm workers, who immigrated during the 1920s and 1930s. Their experiences span the gap between these early immigrants and those Filipinos who came after the liberalization of immigration laws in 1965. Jamero's book is a sequel of sorts, to Carlos Bulosan's America Is in the Heart, with themes of heartbreaking struggle against racism and poverty, and eventual triumph."" Jamero describes his early life in a farm-labor camp in Livingston, California, and the path that took him, through naval service and graduate school, far beyond Livingston. A longtime community activist and civic leader, Jamero describes decades of toil and progress before the Filipino community entered the sociopolitical mainstream."
People`s Witness: The Journalist In Modern Politics,"['Prof. Fred Inglis', 'Fred Inglis']","""Political journalists are central figures in the titanic struggles of modern history, not only telling us about events but also interpreting them and shaping our views. This book explores the relationship between journalism and politics in the twentieth century and tells the stories of the journalists - both good and bad - who have played major roles."" ""Fred Inglis tracks the flamboyant biographies of giants of the genre, from the early newspapermen during the Russian revolution to those that reported on the Spanish Civil War, the hideous discoveries at Dachau, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. He scrutinises news proprietors such as Joseph Pulitzer, Katharine Graham, and Rupert Murdoch; writer journalists like George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, Andre Malraux, and Martha Gellhorn; and journalists of conscience - William Shirer in Nazi Germany, James Cameron in Asia, Neil Sheehan in Vietnam, Norman Mailer at the Pentagon, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein after Watergate, and others. Inglis examines the great pioneers of broadcast news journalism, notably Ed Murrow, Walter Cronkite, and Alistair Cooke, as well as such celebrated BBC television journalists as John Cole and John Simpson. He explores the relations between political journalists and their all-powerful proprietors and exposes fascinating instances of pomposity, misjudgment, and downright untruthfulness as well as moments of courage and responsibility."" Fred Inglis is professor of cultural studies at the University of Sheffield."
Sounds English: Transnational Popular Music (transnational Cultural Studies),['Nabeel Zuberi'],"""Popular music culture serves as an arena for debates on English and British national identity in this lively discussion of English popular music of the 1980s and 1990s. Against the background of his own upbringing as a Pakistani Brit, Nabeel Zuberi deftly combines a detailed account of the development of this music with a sophisticated assessment of its relation to the politics of cultural identity in Britain."" ""Zuberi looks at how the sounds, images, and lyrics of English popular music generate and critique ideas of national belonging, recasting the social and even the physical landscapes of cities like Manchester and London. The Smiths and Morrissey play on romanticized notions of the (white) English working class, while the Pet Shop Boys map a ""queer urban Britain"" in the AIDS era. The techno-culture of raves and dance clubs incorporates both an anti-institutional do-it-yourself politics and emergent leisure practices, while the potent mix of technology and creativity in British black music includes local conditions as well as a sense of global diaspora. British Asian musicians, drawing on Afrodiasporic and South Asian traditions, seek a sense of place in Britain as commercial interests try to pin down an image of them to market."" ""Sounds English shows how popular music complicates cherished notions of Englishness as it activates cultural outsiders and taps into a sense of not belonging.""--BOOK JACKET."

Casting Shadows: Images From A New South Africa,"['Edward West', 'Leslie King-hammond']","""South Africa is in the midst of dramatic transformation. For its communities of color - long cast in the role of shadow to the white population - this is a time when identities and borders are in the process of redefinition. In this body of photographic work, Edward West uses the metaphorical power of shadow to foreground the shifting visibility of South Africa's black population post apartheid."" ""In focusing on the private moments of these newly empowered people within their own communities, West has created a complex, visually compelling study of the ways in which identity is inextricable linked to environment. With the authenticity of full frame street photography, the images reveal moments in which the gesture - of people, place and shadow - becomes an essential way of knowing."" ""This work bears testimony that there is much to be found in the shadow - if we are willing to enter the darkness.""--BOOK JACKET."
Steppin' On The Blues: The Visible Rhythms Of African American Dance (folklore And Society),['Jacqui Malone'],"""Steppin' on the Blues"" explores not only the meaning of dance in African American life but also the ways in which music, song, and dance are interrelated in African-American culture. Dance as it has emanated from the black community is a pervasive, vital, and distinctive form of expression—its movements speak eloquently of African American values and aesthetics. Beyond that it has been, finally, one of the most important means of cultural survival. Former dancer Jacqui Malone throws a fresh spotlight on the cultural history of black dance, the Africanisms that have influenced it, and the significant role that vocal harmony groups, black college and university marching bands, and black sorority and fraternity stepping teams have played in the evolution of dance in African American life. From the cakewalk to the development of jazz dance and jazz music, all Americans can take pride in the vitality, dynamism, drama, joy, and uncommon singularity with which African-American dance has gifted the world."
Observing The Erotic Imagination,['Robert J. Stoller'],"""Stoller is not just a scientist but a lover of words and language. In this book, his text is as playful, charming, and serious as his topic.

Land Filled With Flies: A Political Economy Of The Kalahari,['Edwin N. Wilmsen'],"""The image of a pristine isolation has been almost as common in research on foragers as in the popular media. <i>Land filled with Flies</i> is a sustanined argument against such views. Wilmsen marshals an enormous quantity of historical, archival, archeological, ethnographic, and survey data on the Kalahari Zhu to show how far from the reality these images are, how they have their own historical provenance, how they have been analytically distorting, and how they have proven politically pernicious for living groups like the Zhu.""--Pauline Peters, <i>Science</i>
<p>""[A] major work. . . . Anthropologists will, and should, use Wilmsen's meticulously detailed study to revise their early lectures in the introductory course, and no future study of African 'foragers' should ignore it.""--Parker Shipton, <i>American Anthropologist</i></p>

The Mandate Of Heaven: Hidden History In The Book Of Changes,['S. J.

While sinologists rely on historical criticism to explain the meaning of the work, those who use it for divination tend to accept without question the traditional account of its origin and purpose. Whereas modern scholars are generally dismissive of the book's reputed mystical significance, traditionalists may resent academic research into the oracle because it seems irreverent or iconoclastic. The Mandate of Heaven attempts to resolve the antagonism between these two approaches.""--BOOK JACKET."
A Fortran Coloring Book,['Roger Kaufman'],"""The right way to read a FORTRAN book,"" the author of this one tells us now that we've read <i>his</i> almost to its last page, ""is by a series of skimming passes. Each time through you pick up a bit more of the nitty-gritty detail. When you pick up an IBM manual, for instance, first flip through it looking for the jokes. There aren't any, so go back and flip through again, getting familiar with the overall idea. Then flip through from back to front, side to side, and top to bottom. If there's a centerfold, you're in the wrong publication! Each time through, you'll be looking for specific details connected with whatever you are doing at the time on the computer. After a while, the whole works will have seeped through your skin by osmosis."" This introduction to FORTRAN works like that, squared. Or unsquared. Anyway, it's unlike any technical manual or textbook you've ever seen. You may <i>think</i> you're chuckling knowingly at some felicitous irreverence the author has craftily inserted, or gravely pondering a remark by one of his cartoon animals, or groaning over an especially outrageous pun. You may even think you're just coloring the giraffe yellow. But you're <i>really</i> learning FORTRAN—how to use it, how to keep it from using you—on the sly. High school kids can deal with it. The book will also appeal to, like, college sophomores, since it revels in a brand of collegiate humor that is just not going to go away, that is going to last—alas—through generations of computers. And sophomores, nowadays, are finding that FORTRAN is more often a prerequisite or academic requirement than is, oh, French, just to mention another popular modern language.
<p>The book teaches its readers all they need to know to get a start at programming real computers about such things as algorithms, the arithmetic ""if,"" array storage, artichokes, assignment statements, branches, bugs (including those in programs), ""call"" statements, complex constants, conditional branches, control statements, dimension statements, ""do"" loops, dummy arguments, errors, exponential notation, floating point numbers, floormats, the Gauss-Seidel method, ""go-to"" statements, hierarchy, integer field specifications, Kaufman, line printers, logical assignment statements, mixed modes, nested implied ""do"" loops, parentheses, prunes, ""read"" statements, recursion relations, relational operators, specification statements, Spiro Whatsisname, storage, subprograms, ""type"" statements, unary and ornery operators, ""write"" statements, X-field specifications, and you-can't-get-there-from-here statements.</p>
<p>That's not all, folks, and not in that order. Like any good book that's not a dictionary, this one is ordered in a functional rather than alphabetical way, but some of these topics think they deserve top billing, so...</p>
<p>Roger Kaufman first tried out his coloring book in a course he taught to MIT freshmen. They liked it just fine, and said so in their ""formal course evaluation."" They probably learned FORTRAN better—more accurately, more memorably—than they would have from some stuffy text.</p>
<p>Dr. Kaufman wrote the book. I mean, he <i>wrote</i> it, the actual words you see, with a pen. He also drew the pictures, diagrams, flow charts, and things.</p>"
A Mingled Yarn: Chronicle Of A Troubled Family,['Beulah Parker'],"""The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together."" -All's Well That Ends Well
<p>Here is a vivid account of the climate of emotions that can-and in this case did-cause severe mental illness. The reader can sense the emotional atmosphere, feel the unspoken communications, and understand the family myths that created-in a talented, wealthy, and well-born family-two highly neurotic children, and one who later became schizophrenic. This unique document emerged from a series of long conversations between the youngest child and Dr. Beulah Parker, a noted psychoanalyst.<br>
A Mingled Yarn blends scientific observations with novelistic detail as it unfolds an intimate view of daily life in a disturbed family. Occasionally, Dr. Parker interrupts the narrative for some psychoanalytic interpretation of events and personality development, but the book is written in nontechnical language. It illustrates graphically the ways in which environmental and interpersonal factors are crucial in bringing about the development of emotional illness.<br>
Special emphasis is placed on the difficulty that members of this family had in expressing to each other what they really felt, and the havoc wrought by parental ""communication deviation"" and skewed attitudes. A Mingled Yarn is a remarkable document that will fascinate all people interested in emotional health and wellness.</p>"
The Worst Of Evils: The Fight Against Pain,"['Dormandy, Thomas.']","""This book takes the reader around the globe and through the centuries to discover how different cultures have sought to combat and treat physical pain. With colorful stories and sometimes frightening anecdotes, Dr. Thomas Dormandy describes a checkered progression of breakthroughs, haphazard experiments, ignorant attitudes, and surprising developments in human efforts to control pain. Attitudes toward pain and its perception have changed, as have the means of pain relief and scientific understanding. Dr. Dormandy offers a multi-cultural history that culminates with a discussion of today's successes - and failures - in the struggle against pain."" The book's exploration is fused with accounts of the development of specific methods of pain relief, including the use of alcohol, plants, hypnosis, religious faith, stoic attitudes, local anesthesia, general anesthesia, and modern analgesics. Dr. Dormandy also looks at the most recent advances in pain clinics and palliative care for patients with terminal disease as well as the prospects for loosening pain's grip in the future."

"Regulating America, Regulating Sweden: A Comparative Study Of Occupational Safety And Health Policy",['Steven Kelman'],"""This remarkable book...opens up new perspectives for the study of bureaucracy and the political institutions in which governmental bureaucracies are embedded.... This is one of those rare books that actually <i>compares</i> governments...rather than simply offering descriptive accounts of two or more regimes.... Not only are the differences [Kelman] observes between the United States and Sweden striking, they are also in a way counterintuitive.""
<p>—<b>James Q. Wilson</b></p>
<p>The book undertakes a comparative examination of two government agencies—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States and the <i>Arbetarskyddsverket</i> or Worker Protection Board (ASV) in Sweden—that have the same mission: the prevention and control of work-related accidents and diseases. By exploring the differences between the two agencies by reference to the societies in which they operate, the study also compares American and Swedish societies themselves. This comparison illuminates the development of ""adversary institutions"" in American society.</p>
<p>Kelman contrasts the political environments of the two countries, noting that American unions are weaker than those of any other democratic industrial nation, while Sweden's are the strongest; that the United States alone among democratic industrial nations has no mass-based socialist or communist party, while in Sweden the socialists held power continuously from 1932 to 1976. And these differences are reflected in the attitudes of national leaders toward occupational safety and health. Thus, President Ford criticized OHSA as a dramatic example of ""over-regulation,"" while Prime Minister Palme saw the fact that workers still risked life and health on the job as a dramatic example of ""the failures of capitalism.""</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some of the author's key empirical findings could not have been predicted on the basis of these broad differences in political outlook. For example, Kelman finds that rulemaking decisions of the two agencies were quite similar and tended toward more rather than less protective alternatives; that OSHA was far more punitive with regard to compliance than ASV and far more concerned with controlling field inspectors; and that lawyers and the courts were ""highly involved in both rulemaking and compliance in the United States and virtually uninvolved in Sweden."" The book seeks to explain these findings.</p>"

Imagining Lives: Autobiographical Fiction Of Yiddish Writers,['Jan Schwarz'],"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In interwar and post-Holocaust New York, Yiddish autobiographers responded to the upheaval of modern Jewish life in ways that combined artistic innovation with commemoration for a world that is no more. <i>Imagining Lives: Autobiographical Fiction of Yiddish Writers</i> is the first comprehensive study of the autobiographical genre in Yiddish literature. Jan Schwarz offers portraits of seven major Yiddish writers, showing the writer's struggles to shape the multiple identities of their ruptured lives in autobiographical fiction. This analysis of Yiddish life-writing includes discussions of literary representation, self and collectivity, and memory in modern Jewish literature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schwarz shows how Yiddish autobiographical fiction fuses novelistic elements and memoiristic truthfulness in ways that also characterize Jewish life-writing in English and Hebrew. His accessible style, biographical sketches, glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish words, and careful survey of notable texts takes readers on an incomparable journey through modern Yiddish literature."

The genie out of the bottle: world oil since 1970,"['Adelman, Morris Albert.']","<b>Choice Outstanding Academic Title, 1996.</b>
<p>Pictures of oil as the glittering prize, the source of global power and empires, or the hub of an energy crisis have gushed through the media since 1973. What actually happened was very different. M. A. Adelman had written in 1970 that ""the genie is out of the bottle,"" that a group of oil producing countries would control the oil trade to raise prices. Now, twenty-five years later, he has written the fascinating history of the greatest monopoly ever known. The underlying economic analysis is contained in the companion volume <i>The Economics of Petroleum Supply</i>.</p>
<p>Oil was in oversupply in 1970. The oil companies could not keep prices from falling. But the members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) could and did raise prices by restraining output. However, they first had to restrain each other: an endless task, since each of them would gain by cheating on the others. With open and secret agreements, formal and informal, they ""tried to fine-tune with coarse instruments,"" resulting in the so-called energy crisis.</p>
<p>Adelman describes the first timid steps to the ""unbound cartel."" He shows how the producing nations overestimated their power, why they had short time horizons and raised the prices too high for their own good. But after prices declined, then crashed in 1986, the producing nations managed to hold a lower price level. Despite the trillions of petrodollars that fed two major wars, Adelman observes that nearly all OPEC nations are in debt. Non-OPEC production grows, but the cartel survives and the unstable market with it.</p>
<p>Price hawks and doves may be good copy, Adelman notes, but in fact there was never an Arab ""embargo"" against the United States, nor any moderating influence by the United States. Since we must in our own interest protect the Persian Gulf producers, they understandably do nothing to oblige us.</p>"

Landmarks in American Civil Engineering,['Daniel L. Schodek'],"<b>Honorable Mention, Abel Wolman award given by the Public Works Historical Society and American Public Works Association, 1987.</b><p>The Brooklyn Bridge and the Erie Canal are well-known feats of American civil engineering. The building of the Transcontinental Railroad is another remarkable accomplishment, symbolizing the unique role that civil engineers have played in the growth and development of the United States. Yet this extensive survey reveals that there are countless other landmarks of regional or local importance that deserve our attention.</p><p>The Starrucca Viaduct in Pennsylvania, carrier of the early New York and Erie Railroad, is an example. It is one of the country's most beautiful structures, a landmark that, like the others this book describes and illustrates, the visible heritage of the civil engineering profession in America.</p><p><i>Landmarks in American Civil Engineering</i> describes approximately a hundred projects that have been designated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as National Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks - canals, roads, railroads, bridges, tunnels, water supply and control systems, dams, buildings, planned cities and parks, power systems, surveying projects, coastal facilities, and airports. Featured in over 250 illustrations, all of these either still exist or have traces remaining; a map provides a useful guide for the general location of each one. There is no other comprehensive survey of engineering landmarks that spans so many years, project types, and geographic areas.</p><p>The landmarks are discussed in the context of the civil engineer's role and responsibilities in our society. In case after case, Schodek demonstrates that the physical artifact represented a community aspiration or need and that the engineer's role was to meet that need in a tangible work that became a point of order in nature, a proof of man's dominion. The projects range from early examples where persons from many different backgrounds filled the role of civil engineer to later ones where the civil engineer is a trained individual with a clear professional identity. Although they are landmarks for different reasons - some represent the first work of their kind or the first successful trial of a new technology on a significant scale; others set a standard for size, capacity, efficiency, or construction expediency in their time; still others entailed techniques of assembly, construction, financing, or political cooperation; or stand as records of perseverance over natural obstacles - most made a significant contribution to the development of a region or the nation.</p><p>Daniel L. Schodek is Professor of Architectural Technology at Harvard University. In the course of collecting material on this subject he has visited nearly all of the projects, and has consulted original plans, where these exist, and engineering records, particularly those in the archives of the American Society of Civil Engineers</p>"

"Designing Paris: The Architecture Of Duban, Labrouste Duc, And Vaudoyer",['David Van Zanten'],"<b>Winner, Alice Davis Hitchcock Award, Society of Architectural Historians.</b>
<p><i>Designing Paris</i> explores the revolution in French architecture that began around 1830 under the leadership of Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, Louis Duc, and Léon Vaudoyer. It shows how these four architects dominated their profession during the Monarchy of July and the Second Empire of Napoleon III, producing works of elasticity and brilliance not often associated with modern notions of the French Classical tradition, works in which they sought simultaneously to trace the historical evolution of architecture and to explore rational innovations in structure.</p>
<p>This reconciliation of historicism and rationalism, Van Zanten observes, bore fruit in the design and construction of public monuments of great individuality, subtlety, and complexity. These became the generative elements of the city of Paris itself as it was transformed during the middle of the nineteenth century, giving rise to the ""Beaux-Arts"" system of training and design that spread from Paris to the world at large, and to the professional definition of the architect as a public servant.</p>
<p>The buildings from the years of the Monarchy 6 of July (1830-1848) that are discussed and illustrated in detail are Duban's designs for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Labrouste's Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, and Vaudoyer's Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers.</p>
<p>Three of the monuments that were erected during the Second Empire of Napoleon III (who was overthrown in 1870) are the subject of the book's final chapters: Vaudoyer's Marseilles Cathedral, the only cathedral erected in France in the nineteenth century; Duc's Palais de justice on the Ile de la Cité, one of the centerpieces of Haussmann's Paris; and Labrouste's Bibliothèque Nationale, widely regarded as the most conceptu ally innovative work of this generation.</p>
<p><i>Designing Paris</i> discusses the professional, political, and cultural contexts of these great public monuments and examines their relation to the works of such figures as Charles Gamier and Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

The Opl Optimization Programming Language,['Pascal Van Hentenryck'],"<b>with contributions by Irvin Lustig, Laurent Michel, and Jean-François Puget</b>
<p>Linear programming, integer programming, and combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in areas such as planning, scheduling, sequencing, resource allocation, design, and configuration, yet they are still challenging to formulate and express. OPL (Optimization Programming Language) is a new modeling language for combinatorial optimization that simplifies the formulation and solution of optimization problems. Perhaps the most significant dimension of OPL is the support for constraint programming, including sophisticated search specifications, logical and higher order constraints, and support for scheduling and resource allocation applications.</p>
<p>This book, written by the developer of OPL, is a comprehensive introduction to the OPL programming language and its application to problems in linear and integer programming, constraint programming, and scheduling. Readers should be familiar with combinatorial optimization, at least from an application standpoint.</p>
<p>An industrial implementation of OPL is available from the international software company Ilog.</p>"

""<i>America's New Allies</i> gives readers an informative and incisive analysis of the contribution that NATO's three new members will be making to enhance Euro-Atlantic security. The book provides a timely refutation to all the nay-sayers who failed to understand that NATO's enlargement greatly enhances the prospects of a secure and peaceful Europe.""--Zbigniew Brzezinski, Center for Strategic and International Studies

This controversial enlargement of NATO formalizes the new geopolitical realities in Eastern Europe and forces the U.S. military to confront the prospect of defending these former enemies against armed attack.</p>
<p>This round of enlargement is part of a larger restructuring of NATO underway since the end of the Cold War and tested by NATO's 1999 action in Kosovo. The current enlargement--together with the prospect of adding other countries to NATO and the unprecedented institutional challenges highlighted during the Kosovo conflict--represents a defining moment for the emerging post-Cold War security architecture and, in turn, for the long-term relationship between the United States and Europe.

"Island: Poetry And History Of Chinese Immigrants On Angel Island, 1910-1940 (naomi B. Pascal Editor's Endowment)","['Lai, H. Mark.']","<br>
""For thirty years, from 1910 to 1940, Angel Island in San Francisco Bay was the first, often the only, toehold in America for immigrants from China. From the Cantonese Pearl River delta district of Taishan they sailed, fleeing famine and the foreign concessions, bound for the Land of the Flowery Flag, the Golden Mountain. Some were relatives of earlier Chinese immigrants who had come to America for Sutter's gold and stayed to help lay transcontinental railroad tracks. Others, in their anxiety to get to America at whatever cost, pretended to be relatives and arrived with identification papers bought in Canton, and with 'coaching papers,"" carefully constructed and memorized family backgrounds that they hoped would pass them through immigration examiners. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had been relaxed somewhat under pressure from Chinese Government officials in Canton by 1910, when Angel Island was opened, for Chinese immigrants only. But the immigration laws, so far as the Chinese were concerned, seemed designed to exclude rather than to admit. ...
<p>""During the time they spent on the island, as little as a few days, as long as three years, they carved and ink brushed their concerns onto the walls of their barracks. One hundred thirty-five calligraphic poems survived, first discovered by a Federal park ranger after Angel Island was abandoned in 1940. These tell of voyages from China, detainment on the island, attitudes toward the first Americans encountered -- immigration officials and social workers -- and finally the disappointments and triumphs of the immigrants.</p>
<p>""To augment the translations of the poems the authors have interviewed older Chinese who once passed through Angel Island and immigration workers as well, and have set their recollections down verbatim as oral history. Together with the interviews, the poems -- angry, heroic, wrenchingly forlorn, despairing, provocative, resistant -- convey, as no secondhand or thirdhand account could ever do, what it was like to be Chinese and to be on Angel Island."" <i>-New York Times</i></p>"
Public Art By The Book,['Barbara Goldstein'],"<br>
<i>Public Art by the Book</i> is a nuts and bolts guide for arts professionals and volunteers creating public art in their communities. Should a public art program depend on public funding, public-private partnerships, or both? What are the roles that citizens can play in their community's public art program? Can artists themselves ever initiate public artworks? With a wealth of wisdom on practical issues, this book offers information on a variety of topics such as public art planning, funding, and governance; establishing legal agreements with artists; and commissioning single artworks or creating comprehensive art programs. 
<p>Since the earliest monuments and memorials were installed in the United States, definitions of public art have continued to evolve. Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency saw the creation of the Works Progress Administration and the beginning of comprehensive federally sponsored art programs, and 1950s Philadelphia became the first city to pass percent-for-art legislation. As artists have turned their attention toward creating in the public realm rather than simply placing their art in public spaces, public art has assumed a much broader role in community life than ever before. Since the 1990s, the public art resources available to artists and their communities have greatly expanded.Today there are more than three hundred government-funded public art programs in the United States, in addition to scores of public-private partnerships and private agencies creating art in public spaces.</p>
<p><i>Public Art by the Book</i> is the definitive resource for information on public art for local government, arts agencies, arts professionals, and artists themselves. Examples included are cited from cities such as Charlotte, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and Seattle.</p>

Sikh Diaspora: Search For Statehood (global Diasporas),['Tatla Dars'],"<br>
<i>The Sikh Diaspora</i> is an impressive, probing and original examination of the Sikh communities of Britain, Canada, and the United States. The author examines the cultural, economic and social linkages between overseas Sikh communities and the Punjab, discussing the Sikh diaspora's support for a Sikh homelandand its role in highlighting human rights' abuses in the Punjab. Exploring the diaspora's close involvement in issues emanating from its homeland, Dr. Tatla asks whether this involvement indicates an insecure settlement in the new countries. He is especially interested in the ways in which inter-state diplomacy, notably India's pressure on host states to curb ""Sikh extremism"", has affected the position of Sikh communities abroad.
<p>Drawing on literature and media from English and Punjabi sources, Dr. Tatla provides an insight into the emotional and psychological world of the diaspora and its yearning for an independent homeland. The book is a significant contribution to the growing literature on the role of diaspora communities as international actors in challenging the power of nation-states and of host societies. It will be an indispensable text for students of South Asia, and of great interest for those studying international migration and diasporas from the perspective of sociology or politics.</p>"

Storied Lives: Japanese American Students And World War Ii,"['Okihiro, Gary Y. , 1945-']","<br>
During World War II over 5,500 young Japanese Americans left the concentration camps to which they had been confined with their families in order to attend college. <i>Storied Lives</i> describes--often in their own words--how nisei students found schools to attend outside the West Coast exclusion zone and the efforts of white Americans to help them. The book is concerned with the deeds of white and Japanese Americans in a mutual struggle against racism, and argues that Asian American studies--indeed, race relations as a whole--will benefit from an understanding not only of racism but also of its opposition, antiracism.
<p>To uncover this little known story, Gary Okihiro surveyed the colleges and universities the nisei attended, collected oral histories from nisei students and student relocation staff members, and examined the records of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council and other materials.</p>
<p>""Throughout the wartime years when Trudy King and I worked as volunteers in the National Student Relocation Council we had a constant sense of making history. We often talked about the book that we were going to write when the war was over, a book that would tell the story of the nisei students in their own words, but I was unable to do it. It was simply too painful. Gary Okihiro has done a splendid job! All we dreamed of for the book he has done.""--Thomas R. Bodine, former West Coast Director, National Student Relocatioin Council</p>
<p>""This is a solid contribution that will add substantially to our growing body of knowledge and will be useful in rethinking current attitudes towards racism and anti-racist movements. In so doing, it will contribute towards a more generous and less cynical view of race relations.""--Franklin S. Odo, Counselor to the Provost, Smithsonian Institution</p>"
Flannery O'connor And The Mystery Of Love,['Richard Giannone'],"<br>
Flannery O'Connor and the Mystery of Love interprets O'Conner's perplexing fiction on its own terms. By stepping back from prevailing controversies, this seminal study takes the pleasure of turning to the short stories and novels themselves and forming an impression of them while seeking the answers to such questions as they necessarily suggest themselves. This goal inevitably entails a consideration of the hardness and violence that are the hallmark of O'Connor's genius. That severity for Giannone is inseparable from O'Connor's recounting, in her words, ""the action of grace."" God's bounty can leave its beneficiaries with some very real handicaps. Grace in this fiction can make the blood run cold; it can do real injury to the body; and it can annihilate. These devastations paradoxically prepare the characters to receive and give compassion. In its numerous and disturbing forms, the coupling of violence and hardship with divine favor marks the mature nature of O'Connor's Christianity. Suffering is found at heart of love and is its hidden face, agonized and abandoned. This is a love that is an anomaly and an enigma, for the wracked human body holds the glimmer of good omen. Flannery O'Connor and the Mystery of Love traces the evolution of these gaping wounds of love to show how they present the same challenge to her readers as to her characters, all of whom must learn that we are worth what our love is worth."
"Natural grace: the charm, wonder, and lessons of Pacific Northwest animals and plants","['Dietrich, William , 1951-']","<br>
From the interactive clockwork world of geology, tides, Northwest weather, and snow, to the hidden roles of dirt, stream life, and mosses and lichens, Pulitzer Prize winning writer William Dietrich explores the natural splendors of the Pacific Northwest. His topics include alder and cedar; jellyfish, geoducks, crabs, and killer whales; mosquitoes and spiders; gulls, crows, and bald eagles; and sea otters, coyotes, raccoons, possums, deer, and cougars.
<p>This informative and engaging selection of natural history essays is adapted from articles published in the Seattle Times magazine, <i>Pacific Northwest.</i> A native Washingtonian, Dietrich has watched the Northwest double in population during his lifetime. Our rapidly changing view of nature is an underlying theme throughout his wide-ranging essays, as is the timely and essential question of how best to share and conserve the natural world that drew us to the region in the first place.</p>
<p>Not a field guide nor an environmental policy book, <i>Natural Grace</i> is intended as a primer for people who are curious about the environment they live in and the pressures upon it. ""We only care about what we know,"" says the author. ""I've concluded that enthusiasm and commitment begin from learning just how marvelous this region is: Passion has to precede purpose."" And there is much to marvel over. Dietrich has unearthed fascinating and unexpected facts about his subjects, and he has a gift for expressing complex information in clear and vivid language. He asks intriguing questions and makes good use of interviews with Northwest scientists and experts to convey current and historic attitudes and economic realities, and to consider where we go from here.</p>
<p><b>William Dietrich</b> is a staff writer for the <i>Seattle Times' Pacific Northwest</i> magazine. As a science reporter for the Seattle Times he won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. He is the author of <i>Northwest Passage: The Great Columbia River</i> and <i>The Final Forest: The Battle for the Last Great Trees of the Pacific Northwest</i>, as well as several works of fiction. He lives in Anacortes, Washington.</p>
<p>""In snappy, thoughtful, sometimes soaring and often funny prose, Bill Dietrich gives us a remarkable and memorable tour of our biotic realm. His penetrating portraits of flora and fauna both favorite and despised make us realize and cherish our rich natural setting as never before. Natural Graces burgeons forth in a happy parade of neat creatures riding the rain, the snow, the tides, and the quakes, leaving us no excuse at all for ignoring their beauty, fascination, and plight.""--Robert Michael Pyle, author of <i>National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies</i></p>
<p>""William Dietrich approaches the damp woods and shimmering waterways of the Pacific Northwest with a journalist's curiosity and naturalist's sense of wonder. The stories he finds there never fail to inform and delight. <i>Natural Grace</i> celebrates the mystery, complexity, and quirkiness of this still-wild corner of the earth. And it prompts us, even more deeply, to care for it."" - Tim McNulty, author of <i>Olympic National Park: A Natural History</i></p>
<p>""If you enjoyed <i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>, perhaps you'd enjoy knowing more about snow, about cedars, and about every other natural phenomenon that makes the Northwest the most fecund and spectacular corner of our continent. This book should be as useful for anyone living in Oregon and Washington as the Portland and Seattle phonebooks."" - Bill McKibben, author of <i>The End of Nature</i></p>
<p>""Bill Dietrich makes 'the little things that run the world' come gloriously and delightfully to life. If you haven't loved jellyfish and plain old dirt before, you will now. Dietrich writes with wit and charm and sound knowledge of the natural world. This is classic natural history at its best."" - Ann Zwinger, author of <i>Shaped by Wind and Water: Reflections of a Naturalist</i></p>"
Seeing Seattle,['Roger Sale'],"<br>
From the time that Roger Sale's interpretive history <i>Seattle Past to Present</i> was published in 1976 he has often served as an unofficial guide for friends and visitors to Seattle, and has also been asked by those who run professional tours for advice on how to view Seattle with fresh eyes. In <i>Seeking Seattle</i> he invites the reader to join him in walking tours of the city in a collaborative process of looking, asking, and forming opinions and judgments.
<p>The book starts near where Seattle itself started and works out to the city limits in layers. In the first walk, the Pioneer Square area reveals through its buildings--many of them handsomely rehabilitated--how the city reestablished itself after the great fire of 1889. we are asked to observe and evaluate how new buildings and new uses have been combined with old ones, and how architects, builders, and planners have served this historical area. The same points are considered for the downtown business district, Pike Place Market, and other areas near the historic core of the city. We face the breathtaking downtown skyline form view points on Seattle's many hills, from points across the bay at Duwamish Head, and from Seward Park, which ash Seattle's largest stand of old-growth forest.</p>
<p>What makes Seattle distinctively Seattle? Sale muses over this question as he walks through the older residential sections of Queen Anne Hill and Capitol Hill, with their mansions and near mansions. he traces the routes along Lake Washington Boulevard and the influence of the Olmsted brothers in shaping the social as well as the visual landscape of the city. He tours upscale neighborhoods with lake and sound views as well as working-class neighborhoods that owe their history and early growth to nearby mills and streetcar transportation. He visits the Chinatown/International District and the University of Washington, and learns to identify trees in Washington Park Arboretum and to recognize those trees elsewhere. He find the ""enchanted house"" where Mary McCarthy lived as a girl and the garden in which Theodore Roethke sought solitude among trees that ""came closer with a denser shade.""</p>
<p>Sale and photographer Mary Randlett have worked together to integrate photographs closely with text and promote a view of Seattle in a context of new and old, landscapes and skyscrapers, neighborhood streets and remarkable vistas. Estimated times for each walk (or drive, in outlying areas) and bus route information are provided.</p>"
Bringing Indians To The Book (emil And Kathleen Sick Book Series In Western History And Biography),['Albert Furtwangler'],"<br>
In 1831 a delegation of Northwest Indians reportedly made the arduous journey from the shores of the Pacific to the banks of the Missouri in order to visit the famous explorer William Clark. This delegation came, however, not on civic matters but on a religious quest, hoping, or so the reports ran, to discover the truth about the white men's religion. The story of this meeting inspired a drive to send missionaries to the Northwest. Reading accounts of these souls ripe for conversion, the missionaries expected a warmer welcome than they received, and they recorded their subsequent disappointments and frustrations in their extensive journals, letters, and stories.
<p><i>Bringing Indians to the Book</i> recounts the experiences of these missionaries and of the explorers on the Lewis and Clark Expedition who preceded them. Though they differed greatly in methods and aims, missionaries and explorers shared a crucial underlying cultural characteristic: they were resolutely literate, carrying books not only in their baggage but also in their most commonplace thoughts and habits, and they came west in order to meet, and attempt to change, groups of people who for thousands of years had passed on their memories, learning, and values through words not written, but spoken or sung aloud. It was inevitable that, in this meeting of literate and oral societies, ironies and misunderstandings would abound.</p>
<p>A skilled writer with a keen ear for language, Albert Furtwangler traces the ways in which literacy blinded those Euro-American invaders, even as he reminds us that such bookishness is also our own.</p>

All Powers Necessary And Convenient: A Play Of Fact And Speculation,"['Jenkins, Mark F.']","<br>
In the Seattle of 1948 legislative hearings were called to investigate Communism in Washington State. The inquisition became an early, effective example of American politics at midcentury when Cold War anxiety escalated into hysteria, feeding what was to become known on a national level as the McCarthy era. The Canwell Committee, as it was popularly called, made a frontal assault on unsanctioned political thought and activism. Suspected Communists teaching at the University of Washington were fired, careers and reputations were smashed, a highly acclaimed theatre company was forced out of existence, livelihoods were lost and lives shattered. 
<p><i>All Powers Necessary and Convenient</i>, first performed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the hearings, brings to life personal and political dramas of several participants central to these events. The play blends dialogue drawn verbatim from transcripts, newspaper quotes, and personal interviews with scenes of fictional conjecture to examine the limits of political discourse and actions in a democracy.</p>

Eat everything before you die: a Chinaman in the counterculture,"['Chan, Jeffery Paul']","<br>
In this vibrant and original novel, Christopher Columbus Wong, orphan son of a Chinatown bachelor community, is trying to invent a family for himself while all around him American popular culture is reinventing itself with sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Christopher finds himself on a wild journey with his gay older brother, Peter, a pan-Pacific TV chef; the defrocked, deranged, and eroding ex-director of a Chinatown settlement house, Reverend Ted Candlewick; the sharp-eyed, conspiring matriarch Auntie Mary, the bridge between the conflicting values that make up this cultural stew; and Uncle Lincoln, a bachelor, short order cook, and, quite possibly, Christopher and Peter's father. Further complicating Christopher's voyage are his ex-wives: Winnie, a Hong Kong immigrant looking for a green card, and Melba, an American orphan of the counterculture.
<p>Set against the backdrop of America's wars in Asia and the assimilation of that experience--the refugees, the stereotypes, the food--<i>Eat Everything Before You Die</i> is an ironic commentary on the identities the children of Chinese American immigrants concoct from their questionable histories, cultural practices, and survival strategies.</p>
<p>Chan's riotous story will appeal to general readers, particularly those interested in the Asian American experience, and will be of strong, enduring interest to students and scholars in Asian American Studies.</p>

Quiet Odyssey: A Pioneer Korean Woman In America (classics Of Asian American Literature),['Mary Paik Lee'],"<br>
Mary Paik Lee, born Paik Kuang Sun in 1900, left her native country in 1905, traveling with her parents as a political refugee after Japan imposed control over Korea at the close of the Russo-Japanese War. Her father labored in the sugar plantations of Hawaii for a year and a half before taking his family to California, where Mrs. Lee has lived ever since. Though her father knew the comforts enjoyed by the educated traditional elite in Korea, after emigration he and his family shared the poverty stricken existence endured by thousands of Asian immigrants in early twentieth century America. Mrs. Lee's parents earned their living as farm laborers, tenant farmers, cooks, and janitors, and the family always took in laundry. Her father tried mercury mining until his health gave out. In their turn, Mrs. Lee and her husband farmed, sold produce, and managed apartment buildings.
<p>The author is engagingly outspoken and is extremely observant of her social and natural surroundings. Recounted incidents take on memorable life, as do the sharply etched settings of California's agricultural and mining country. She tells of singular hardship surmounted with resilience and characteristic grace.

<p><i>Nisei Memories</i> is an extraordinarily moving account of two second-generation Japanese Americans who were demonized as threats to national security during World War II. Based on Paul Takemoto's interviews with his parents, in which they finally divulge their past, Nisei Memories follows their lives before, during, and after the war -- his father serving his country, his mother imprisoned by it.</p>
<p>At the start of the war, twenty-one-year-old Kaname (Ken) Takemoto was a sophomore at the University of Hawaii. Although classified as an ""enemy alien,"" he served in the army, first as a Varsity Victory Volunteer and then as a combat medic with the 100th Battalion /442nd Regimental Combat Team in Italy.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year-old Alice Setsuko Imamoto was attending high school in California when the war began. Soon after, her father and mother were both imprisoned. She and her three sisters were sent to an assembly center in Santa Anita, and eventually the family was reunited at a relocation camp in Jerome, Arkansas. She was finally released to attend Oberlin College on a music scholarship.</p>
<p>Like so many others, Ken and Alice had never spoken of their experiences, which, as their son explains, ""loomed as backdrops to our lives, but until now were never discussed."" While his father had relived his wartime experiences over and over in his mind, his mother blocked many of hers from memory. Takemoto fills in some of the gaps with information gleaned from correspondence and documents. Of unusual power and appeal, the interviews lead readers through the half century of uncertainty and trauma endured by the family before it was able to confront issues central to its existence. They tell a story of perseverance and forgiveness and, ultimately, pride.</p>

Iran And The Bomb: The Abdication Of International Responsibility (the Ceri Series In Comparative Politics And International Studies),['Thérèse Delpech'],"<br>
The Iranian regime is in the midst of a dangerous nuclear poker game with the West, playing for the highest possible stakes. Iran, ruled today by Ali Khamenei, the Guide of the Revolution, and the recently elected President Ahmadinejad, has no intention of yielding to international pressure exhorting it to suspend all uranium enrichment activity, a necessary but intermediate step in the process of building nuclear weapons. Iran is also seeking to join the WTO and it had been offered this incentive by the United States and the EU '3' (France, Britain and Germany) in exchange for a promise to cease enrichment. However, President Ahmadinejad's 12 April announcement that Iran has successfully enriched uranium takes the crisis to a higher plane. It also leaves many questions unanswered, above all, how the international community should respond to this unwelcome development. In this hard-hitting analysis of Tehran's intentions, Thérèse Delpech, one of the world's leading authorities on international nuclear security, outlines how Iran has successfully beguiled the international community for years, aided and abetted by China and Russia, both of which are eager to benefit commercially from Iran acquiring nuclear power. She dissects Iran's nuclear programme in minute detail, drawing on her inside knowledge. The first section of the book retraces the history of Iran's nuclear project from the 1970s--one that was launched by the former Shah with help from several Western countries--till today, when national pride, exemplified by Ahmadinejad's bellicose rhetoric, makes it highly unlikely that Tehran will bow to the diktats of the international community. She also examines the period when the programme was resumed, during Iran's war with Iraq (1985-90). The second section picks apart the strategy of the various actors in this global crisis: Iran, the EU '3', the United States, Russia, China and the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency). In the third section, she sets out the various possible solutions in terms of their feasibility, practically and politically: dismantling by force, supervised third party reprocessing, referral to the Security Council, Iranian appeasement. In conclusion, Delpech unravels the tangled regional and international dimensions of the crisis, setting out the enormous impact it is having on the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Israel, America's presence in Iraq and the wider Middle East and the future of the much weakened Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NTP)."
Doors To Madame Marie (mclellan Book),['Odette Meyers'],"<br>
This eloquent and spirited memoir of a young Jewish girl's coming of age in Nazi-occupied France recounts her own family's difficult and brave survival and portrays as well the love and quiet heroism of her rescuers. A powerful central figure is Madame Marie Chotel, the Catholic concierge and seamstress who hides seven-year-old Odette and her mother in her broom closet while police search, who secures the child's safe haven in a distant province, and who is cherished by Odette, even in absentia, as her godmother and mentor.
<p>The story unfolds as a drama of many parts, told in a lyrical prose rich with flashes of humor and a startling perceptivity that takes nothing for granted. Odette is hidden during the occupation, a secret Jew in a remote and conservative Catholic village. Absorbed in the village's life, she becomes a fervent Catholic child. When she returns to Paris, she struggles over her Jewish identity and religion and her fierce nostalgia for the wild countryside, but she accepts again the secular Judaism of her working-class intellectual parents, immigrants from Poland who survived the war (though many relatives did not), her father as a French Army prisoner of war, her mother as a member of the Resistance. And she again finds Madame Marie, who tells her, simply, to look in her heart. ""The world can be confusing, maddening, and a whole city, a whole country can vanish from one's life but as long as Madame Marie sits at her sewing machine, everything can be made right again.""</p>
<p>The story does not close with the war's end and the departure of fourteen-year-old Odette and her parents for America. It continues with her search, many years later, for Madame Marie, and with the inscription of the name of Marie Chotel on the Wall of Righteous Gentiles at the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, D.C. This memoir is extraordinary not only for its broad historic sensibility but for its fascinating portrait of wartime France from the unusual perspective of a Jew whose life was permitted to go on.</p>"
I Will Fight No More Forever: Chief Joseph And The Nez Perce War,['Merrill D. Beal'],"<br>
Unpublished letters and diaries by eyewitnesses, interviews with decedents, an intimate knowledge of the country enrich this narrative of the heroic Nez Perce Indian War waged in 1877 against relocation.
<p>The result is a well documented chronicle offering new perspective on prewar Indian-white relations, United States government pressures and nontreaty rebellions, the five battles, subjection and surrender, and on the character of the leaders on both sides.</p>
<p>""From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever,"" Chief Joseph said in surrender. But as a guardian and protector of his people he at last succeeded in bringing back the remaining members of his tribe to their beloved valley.</p>
<p>Calling Professor Beal's book, ""definitive, but not final,"" Herman J. Deutsch, professor emeritus of American history at Washington State University, writes in the foreword: ""Joseph and his band remain an example and inspiration to those who today are seeking recognition as human beings, equal in the sight of God and therefore entitled to like status among men. Those who recognize that such aspirations must not for long remain unfulfilled can derive from Nez Perce history examples of the consequences of policies conceived in ignorance and colored with disdain of the culture and way of life of minority peoples. ...A world surfeited with deceptive success stories can ill afford to forget a people and their leader who attained their true moral stature as they were facing their doom.""</p>"
Alligators May Be Present: A Novel,['Andrew Furman'],"<br>
While many Jews have picked Florida as the perfect place to retire, Matt Glassman has chosen it as the place to begin his adulthood. Perhaps that's because the pressures of life have always reminded him about his grandfather who mysteriously disappeared from the family twenty years ago. Now, while he tries to begin a family of his own, he also builds a relationship with the one person who might know the truth about his grandfather?s disappearance: his grandmother. She's remained stubbornly reticent on the topic all these years, but when a familiar old man shows up at Glassman's office he thinks he may finally get some answers."

<p>Named an ""Outstanding Title"" in University Press Books for Public and Secondary School Libraries, 2009</p>
<p>In this introduction to sustainable landscaping practices, Linda Chalker-Scott addresses the most common myths and misconceptions that plague home gardeners and horticultural professionals. Chalker-Scott offers invaluable advice to gardeners gardeners who have wondered:</p>
<p>o Are native plants the best choice for sustainable landscaping?</p>
<p>o Should you avoid disturbing the root ball when planting?</p>
<p>o Are organic products better or safer than synthetic ones?</p>
<p>o What is the best way to control weeds-fabric or mulch?</p>
<p>o Does giving vitamins to plants stimulate growth?</p>
<p>o Are compost teas effective in controlling diseases?</p>
<p>o When is the best time to water in hot weather?</p>
<p>o If you pay more, do you get a higher-quality plant?</p>
<p>o How can you differentiate good advice from bad advice?</p>
<p>The answers may surprise you. In her more than twenty years as a university researcher and educator in the field of plant physiology, Linda Chalker-Scott has discovered a number of so-called truths that originated in traditional agriculture and that have been applied to urban horticulture, in many cases damaging both plant and environmental health. The Informed Gardener is based on basic and applied research from university faculty and landscape professionals, originally published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>After reading this book, you will:</p>
<p>o Understand your landscape or garden plants as components of a living system</p>
<p>o Save time (by not overdoing soil preparation, weeding, pruning, staking, or replacing plants that have died before their time)</p>
<p>o Save money (by avoiding worthless or harmful garden products, and producing healthier, longer-lived plants)</p>
<p>o Reduce use of fertilizers and pesticides</p>
<p>o Assess marketing claims objectively</p>
<p>This book will be of interest to landscape architects, nursery and landscape professionals, urban foresters, arborists, certified professional horticulturists, and home gardeners.</p>

Nisei Daughter,"['Sone, Monica Itoi , 1919-']","<br>
With charm, humor, and deep understanding, a Japanese American woman tells how it was to grow up on Seattle's waterfront in the 1930s and to be subjected to ""relocation"" dring World War II. Along with some 120,000 other persons of Japanese ancestry--77,000 of whom were U.S. citizens--she and her family were uprooted from their home and imprisoned in a camp. In this book, first published in 1952, she provides a unique personal account of these experiences.

He compares and contrasts the primate species, looking at each with a specific anatomical focus. The range of diversity emerges as the particular characteristics of the species becomes increasingly distinct. Swindler also considers primate behavior and its close connections with environment and evolutionary differences. His account of 65 million years of successful adaptation and evolution demonstrates the drama of paleontology as evidence accrues and gaps in the history of primate evolution gradually close.</p><p>A succinct and highly readable exposition of the past and present members of the zoological Order Primates.

Becoming Citizens: Family Life and the Politics of Disability,['Susan Schwartzenberg'],"<br>Following the Second World War, a generation of Seattle parents went against conventional medical wisdom and chose to bring up their children with developmental disabilities in the community. This book presents a stunning visual narrative of thirteen of these remarkable families. With a rich array of interviews, photographs, newspaper clippings, official documents, and personal mementos, photographer Susan Schwartzenberg captures moving recollections of the struggle and perseverance of these parents. <i>Becoming Citizens</i> traces their dogged determination to make meaningful lives for their children in the face of an often hostile system.<p>Breaking the silence that characterizes the history of disability in the United States, <i>Becoming Citizens</i> is a substantive contribution to social and regional history. It demonstrates the ways in which personal experiences can galvanize communities for political action. The centerpiece of the book is the story of four mothers-turned-activists who coauthored Education for All, a crucial piece of Washington State legislation that was a precursor to the national law securing educational rights for every person with a disability in America.</p><p><i>Becoming Citizens</i> is a deeply compassionate testament to the experience of family life and disability, as it is to the ways in which ordinary citizens become activists.

Images From The World Between: The Circus In Twentieth-century American Art,"['Gustafson', 'Donna']","<i>Images from the World Between</i> is an engaging survey of circus imagery in twentieth-century American art. In her introductory essay, curator Donna Gustafson chronicles the history of the American circus, showing how and why it came to be an important subject for American art. Through a discussion of a wide range of paintings, sculptures, prints, and photographs, Gustafson examines how the circus has been represented both as a microcosm of society and as an alternative reality. Some artists have been drawn to the abstract beauty of the circus ring, tent, and performances. Others have immortalized individual performers such as trapeze artist Alfredo Codona, animal trainer Clyde Beatty, and aerialist Lillian Lietzel for their physical prowess, grace, and courage. Still others have focused on the darker aspects of circus life, such as the danger inherent in many of the performances and the appeal of the grotesque.
<p> The book accompanies an exhibition organized by the American Federation of Arts. Among the artists discussed are Diane Arbus, George Bellows, Rhona Bitner, Alexander Calder, John Stuart Curry, Charles Demeuth, Walt Kuhn, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Lisette Model, and Bruce Nauman. In addition to Gustafson's, the book contains essays by Karal Ann Marling on the postwar revival of interest in circus motifs and on the clown in popular culture, by Ellen Handy on the circus in twentieth-century photography, by Lee Siegel on the circus in twentieth-century literature, and by Eugene R.

Investment Choices in Industry,['Constance E. Helfat'],"<i>Investment Choices in Industry</i> lays the groundwork for increasingly broader and more varied application of portfolio theory to the making of operating decisions in firms. Portfolio theory until now has been used mainly to allocate investments in financial assets such as stocks and bonds; here Constance Helfat extends the theory to evaluate the risk of nonfinancial investment decisions in firms. Analyzing the investment and R &amp; D decisions of large oil companies, she uses portfolio theory as a tool to predict firm behavior and proposes that, when making internal resource allocations, firms seek not only to earn profits but also to minimize total firm investment risk as well.<p>Helfat's study differs from existing work in a number of respects. The theoretical model it develops (an adaptation of the Tobin-Markowitz portfolio selection model of stock market investment) is highly comprehensive. It focuses on the composition of a firm's investment portfolio as well as on the risk and return characteristics of each individual investment. The model also incorporates the dependence of certain asset prices - such as those determined by auction - on internal firm covariance risk. Unlike many empirical studies, the method used in implementing the model relies on micro-level, projectspecific data to forecast ex ante risks and returns to firm investments.</p><p>Finally, Helfat uses a unique data set - the Financial Reporting System of the U.S. Department of Energy - to analyze the composition of actual investment expenditures in the petroleum industry.</p><p>Constance E.

Principles Of Operating Systems,['Sacha Krakowiak'],"<i>Principles of Operating Systems</i> is unique among current texts on operating systems in its balanced treatment of principles and their application. It is comprehensive and offers richly detailed algorithms at every stage using the familiar Pascal-like notation; it covers basic computer mechanisms, and provides a variety of thoughtful and challenging exercises.
<p>This introductory text by a leading French computer scientist unfolds the organization of operating systems in the field of shared memory systems (or ""centralized"" systems) for which design principles are now reasonably stable. Its analysis of these principles is the most rigorous and complete available: basic concepts such as programs execution mechanisms, modular and hierarchical decomposition, interfaces, parallel processes, synchronization principles, information management, resources and memory allocation, and multiprogramming are covered in detail, and recent developments in the field of distributed systems are considered as well.</p>
<p>Krakowiak illustrates the application of these principles in simplified examples from real systems - including CP/M for an overview of a microcomputer system, the Multics system for its addressing and linking scheme, the Plessey 250 for capabilities, Unix for its file system and process management - that will make it easier for readers to study a full-blown system by providing guidelines for analyzing and identifying its essential features. Some of the chapter exercises cover direct applications of the concepts discussed, others require design work and can form the basis of a project, while still others are intended to encourage investigation into aspects not covered in the book and provide annotated references.</p>

Prospects For Peacemaking: A Citizen's Guide To Safer Nuclear Strategy,"['Harlan Cleveland', 'Lincoln P. Bloomfield']","<i>Prospects for Peacemaking</i> provides a genuinely fresh look at embedded assumptions about national security. It clears the way for a security policy based less on outmoded premises and more on a purposeful strategy for peace in a nuclear world. And it demonstrates one model of a creative interaction between citizens and specialists, one that can be replicated in any community. 
<p>""To the village square must go the essential facts about atomic weapons,"" Albert Einstein wrote in 1946. ""From there must come America's voice."" The seven essays in <i>Prospects for Peacemaking</i> take up Einstein's challenge - even more urgent today - by demystifying the criti cal issues of war, peace, and national security and opening the way for informed citizen involvement in these issues.</p>
<p>The opening chapter explains why we are currently at a good point for engaging in the process of rethinking American strategic policy. Those that follow outline the basic premises of the current relations between the United States and the Soviet Union; the way the military thinks about arms and arms control; the question of whether negotiations can ever keep up with technology; the European perspective on arms control; and the special problem of managing crisis situations. The book concludes with an essay by Dean Rusk on diplomacy in the nuclear era.</p>
<p> <i>Prospects for Peacemaking</i> grew out of ""the Minnesota experiment,"" an extraordinary year long process of dialogue between experts in the arms-control community and public citizens, sponsored by the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs. Harlan Cleveland is Professor of Public Affairs and Dean of the Institute. LincolnP. Bloomfield is Professor of Political Science at MIT, and an adjunct professor at the Humphrey Institute.</p>"

Simulating Computer Systems : Techniques and Tools,['Myron H. MacDougall'],"<i>Simulating Computer Systems</i> provides an introduction to simulation for computer and communication-system designers who want to analyze the performance of their designs. In it MacDougall describes a discrete-event simulation language called smpl, discusses simulation modeling with smpl (using a variety of models as examples), describes the design of smpl, and presents a C language implementation.<p>The book's first part introduces smpl simulation operations using a queueing network simulation model; addresses the development, verification, and validation of simulation models (including hybrid modeling and the use of analytic models in verification); and describes how to estimate the accuracy of simulation results. A multiprocessor system model and a CSMA/CD LAN model are studied in detail to emphasize the joint use of simulation and analytic models and to further illustrate the use of smpl. Projects for the reader include a CPU pipeline model and a token ring LAN model.</p><p>The implementation of smpl is the focus of the book's second part, which describes the design of smpl function and data structures and outlines a variety of extensions. This description, together with the C source listing provided, will allow the reader to implement smpl on any system.</p><p>M. H.

Computational Complexity Of Machine Learning (acm Distinguished Dissertation),['Michael J. Kearns'],"<i>The Computational Complexity of Machine Learning</i> is a mathematical study of the possibilities for efficient learning by computers. It works within recently introduced models for machine inference that are based on the theory of computational complexity and that place an explicit emphasis on efficient and general algorithms for learning.
<p>Theorems are presented that help elucidate the boundary of what is efficiently learnable from examples. These results take the form of both algorithms with proofs of their performance, and hardness results demonstrating the intractability of learning in certain natural settings. In addition the book contains lower bounds on the resources required for learning, an extensive study of learning in the presence of errors in the sample data, and several theorems demonstrating reducibilities between learning problems.</p>

The Economics Of Public Utility Regulation,"['Crew, Michael A.']","<i>The Economics of Public Utility Regulation</i> surveys the large literature on the regulation of public utilities and provides industry studies with specific applications of the more general theories. The industries covered Include telecommunications, electricity, gas, and water. The authors explain the economic concepts involved And present a rich framework for understanding the institutional and administrative context of the regulatory process.
<p>Michael Crew and Paul Kleindorfer consolidated their reputations as experts in the field of regulated public utilities in 1979, when their book <i>Public Utility Economics</i> was published. Since then, theoretical concepts for dealing with utilities have been significantly extended, and utilities themselves have been dramatically transformed. This new book presents an indispensible update.</p>
<p>The opening section introduces the basic welfare foundations, including a neoclassical treatment of efficiency and equity and a development of the principles of the new institutional economics. These concepts are then employed to examine the problems of natural monopoly and regulation.</p>
<p>The material on welfare-optimal pricing puts special emphasis on the peak-load pricing problem, which is shown to be pervasive in public utilities of all varieties. Both deterministic models and stochastic models of peak-load pricing are examined. Alternative governance structures for natural monopoly are evaluated in some detail, with the U.S. system of privately owned regulated monopolies and the predominant governance structure in the U.S. - rate-of-return regulation - receiving the greatest attention. The authors next take a close-up look at four specific public utilities focusing on pricing and efficiency.</p>
<p>Michael A. Crew is Professor of Economics at the Graduate School of Management, Rutgers University. Paul R. Kleindorfer is Professor of Decision Sciences and Economics at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and Director of the Center for the Study of Organizational Innovation. <i>The Economics of Public Utility Regulation</i> is the thirteenth in the MIT Press Series on the Regulation of Economic Activity, edited by Richard Schmalensee.</p>"
The Employed Inventor In The United States,"['Fredrik Neumeyer', 'John C. Stedman']","<i>The Employed Inventor in the United States</i> treats a problem peculiar to most industrial states, where the independent inventor has to a large extent been replaced by the corporation or institution employee. The employed inventor is hired to use his talents in the interests of that one corporation or institution which provides research facilities for his use either in working on projects of his own choosing and at his own pace or in adhering to specific assignments and schedules imposed by the employer. Some of the main questions in this field are: What rights does the employed inventor have over his work? What are the rewards of his work? What legal and practical problems does his status raise for his employer? These and other questions are discussed in this book, the first general survey of the legal and practical relations between employer and inventor-employee in the United States.
<p>After an introduction by Neumeyer dealing statistically with the extent and disposition of R&amp;D in the United States and the source of funds, Stedman has written a chapter on legal relations between employer and employee in regard to patents, copyright, and trade secrets, surveying the common law of invention. The remainder of the book, by Neumeyer, presents a spectrum of 20 detailed case studies treating employee-invention policy in industry (9 companies), government (4 agencies), and universities (7 institutions). There is also a chapter on collective bargaining agreements containing patent clauses with respect to employee inventions as concluded by certain companies, especially in the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>This is an exploding field, one of the biggest in the industrial and business worlds. <i>The Employed Inventor in the United States</i> addresses the growing public interest in R&amp;D policy and administration as well as the large professional population employed in such activity. The authors expect this field to become more important still, as cooperation between U.S. corporations and institutions and their foreign counterparts increases and as competition in engineering innovations for new products and processes grows in national and international markets.</p>"

The Mongols,['Jeremiah Curtin'],"<i>The Mongols</i> were the superpower of their day, erupting out of Central Asia in 1206 to conquer an empire stretching from Poland to Korea. Their arrival in the Middle East upset the very tenuous balance between Christendom and Islam, sparking a long-simmering rivalry that has, as we all know, lasted to this day.An absorbing, detailed narrative on the clans, feuds, battles, and conquests of the Mongol era, covering every aspect of Mongol intrigue, logistics, and tactics."
The Narc's Game: Organizational And Informational Limits On Drug Law Enforcement,['Peter K. Manning'],"<i>The Narcs' Game</i> draws on Peter K.

The Perception Of Multiple Objects: A Connectionist Approach (neural Network Modelling And Connectionism),['Michael C. Mozer'],"<i>The Perception of Multiple Objects</i> describes a neurally inspired computational model of two-dimensional object recognition and spatial attention that can explain many characteristics of human visual perception. The model, called MORSEL (named for its ability to perform Multiple Object Recognition and attentional Selection), is unique in providing a broad and unified explanation for a wide range of experimental psychological data on visual perception and attention. Although it draws on existing theoretical perspectives from cognitive psychology, it is a fully mechanistic account, not just a functional-level theory.
<p>MORSEL has been trained to recognize letters and words in various positions on its ""retina."" Following training, it can also recognize several items at once, subject to capacity limitations. The model makes predictions about what sorts of information the visual system can process in parallel and what sorts must be processed serially.</p>
<p>Through simulation experiments, chiefly in letter and word perception, MORSEL has been shown to account for a variety of psychological phenomena, including perceptual errors that arise when several items appear simultaneously in the visual field, facilitatory effects of context and redundant information, attentional phenomena, visual search performance, and behaviors exhibited by neurological patients with acquired dyslexia.</p>"
The Photic Field,"['Parry Moon', 'Domina Eberle Spencer']","<i>The Photic Field</i> brings a formal elegance and completeness to the portion of geometrical optics that deals with amounts of radiant energy. Since the time of Lambert, this discipline has been handled piecemeal by a great variety of methods. But by utilizing the full potentialities of field theory, the book unifies the subject and forges a powerful tool for handling practical applications. Such applications include solar heating, lighting design, photographic exposure, and color specification.
<p>The pharosage vector is used throughout the book, and divergence, curl, and gradient are employed. Potentials and quasi-potentials are important, and contour integration allows a double integral to be replaced by a single integral. These and other aspects of field theory will allow the reader to solve photometric problems that were previously difficult to formulate.</p>
<p>Many of the formulations in geometrical optics, although conceptually clear, are computationally unwieldy. As a result, researchers until quite recently have had to rely on a scattered collection of rules of thumb and approximation methods. But now, with the general availability of computer, exact solutions are within range, and thus many of the equations given in <i>The Photic Field</i> may be directly applied almost for the first time.</p>"
The Presidential Election Game,"['Brams, Steven J.']","<i>The Presidential Election Game</i> may change the way you think about presidential elections and, for that matter, American politics in general. It is not filled with statistics about the voting behavior of citizens, nor does it give detailed histories of past campaigns. Rather, it is an analytic treatment of strategy in the race for the presidency, from the primaries to the general election. Using modern game theory and decision theory, Brams demonstrates why certain campaign strategies are more effective than others and supports his analysis with historical evidence."
The Psychopathic God: Adolph Hitler,['Robert Waite'],"<i>The Psychopathic God</i> is the definitive psychological portrait of Adolph Hitler.

Viewing The Earth: The Social Construction Of The Landsat Satellite System,"['Mack, Pamela Etter.']","<i>Viewing the Earth</i> examines the role played by interest groups in shaping the process of technological change, offering valuable insights into how technologies evolve. It traces the history of Landsat from its origins through the launch and use of the first few satellites, showing how a variety of forces shape the form and the eventual reception of any new technology.
<p>The Landsat earth resources satellite system was a project of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration that was created to collect data about earth resources from space. The first satellite was launched in 1972 with great fanfare and high expectations. The data proved useful for everything from finding oil to predicting harvests, yet today the successful commercialization of the program is still uncertain. Why?</p>
<p>To answer this question, Pamela E. Mack focuses on the negotiating process that went on among different parts of the space agency, other interested government agencies, and various organizations that were potential users of the data. This formal and informal negotiating process, she points out, involved not only choices between alternative technologies and the satellite but also conflicting definitions of what the satellite would do. The story is full of fascinating detail, from the concerns of the intelligence community over civilian satellites looking at the earth to the politics of agricultural survey.</p>"
"Vision, Instruction, And Action (artificial Intelligence)",['David Chapman'],"<i>Vision, Instruction, and Action</i> clearly and cleverly describes a sophisticated integrated system called Sonja that takes instruction, can interpret its environment visually, and can play games (in this case the video game, Amazon) on its own. Sonja integrates advances in intermediate visual processing, interactive activity, and natural language pragmatics.
<p>In demonstrating that such systems, rare in artificial intelligence, are possible, David Chapman shows how discoveries in visual psychophysics can be incorporated into Al, how complex activity can result from participation rather than plan following, and how physical context can be used to interpret indexical instructions.</p>
<p>Sonja is able to play a competent beginner's game of Amazon autonomously and at the same time can also make flexible use of human instructions in knowing how to kill off monsters, pick up and use tools, and find its way in a dungeon maze. It extends the author's previous work in developing a new theory of activity by addressing linguistic issues and providing a better understanding of the architecture underlying activity, incorporating many technical improvements.</p>
<p>Sonja also models several pragmatic issues in computational linguistics, focusing on external reference and including linguistic repair processing, and the use of temporal and spatial expressions. It connects language use with more detailed and realistic theories of vision and activity.</p>
<p>In the field of vision research, Sonja provides an implementation of a unified visual architecture, demonstrating that this architecture can support a serious theory of activity. It demonstrates the first instance that various visual mechanisms previously proposed on psychophysical, neurophysiological, and speculative computational grounds can be made useful by connecting them with a natural task domain.</p>"
Wild Solutions : How Biodiversity Is Money in the Bank,"['Andrew Beattie', 'Paul R. Ehrlich', 'Christine Turnbull']","<i>Winner of the 2001 National Outdoor Book Award, Nature and Environment Category</i><p>We live on an unexplored planet, ignorant of more than eighty percent of the species that share our world. In this illustrated book, two eminent ecologists discuss the biological diversity of Earth, showing how the natural systems that surround us play an essential role in protecting our basic life-support systems. Andrew Beattie and Paul Ehrlich tell us about the millions of species providing ecosystem services that maintain the quality of our air and water and the fertility of the soil, dispose of domestic, industrial, and agricultural waste, and protect crops from pests. The authors also describe how biological diversity opens the way for new medicines, construction materials and designs, and manufactured goods. They point to innovative industries that harness species for the biological repair of damaged landscapes, biological mining, biological pest control, and biomonitoring of the environment. The organisms upon which these activities are founded - although often microscopic, obscure, or bizarre - provide natural capital that is worth infinitely more than anyone has previously thought. The authors urge us to protect the biological wealth of our Earth from destructive human activity.--BOOK JACKET.</p>"

Now, Secular Americans-a group comprised not just of atheists and agnostics, but lapsed Catholics, secular Jews, and millions of others who have walked away from religion-are mobilizing and forming groups all over the country (even atheist clubs in Bible-belt high schools) to challenge the exaltation of religion in American politics and public life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a timely and important look at how growing numbers of nonbelievers, disenchanted at how far America has wandered from its secular roots, are emerging to fight for equality and rational public policy.</p>"

The Practice Of Love: Lesbian Sexuality And Perverse Desire,"['De Lauretis, Teresa.']","<p>""... a work that builds a substantial bridge between Freudian psychoanalysis and radical feminist thought, particularly on the subject of lesbianism.... Presenting a complex argument about an issue vital to the psychoanalytic endeavor as well as to feminist theory, The Practice of Love should stimulate a reconsideration of ‘perversion’ and the construction of sexual fantasy. The illumination of the fantasies that make lesbian desire distinctive will necessarily open up our understanding of all sexuality."" —Jessica Benjamin, New York Times Book Review</p>
<p>""Teresa de Lauretis has entwined three books into one: a critical history of psychoanalytic theories of female homosexuality; a bold study of how lesbians keep disappearing from popular culture, especially film; and an original speculation on the dynamics of lesbian desire."" —Elisabeth Young-Bruehl</p>
<p>""An important and original contribution not only to lesbian and gay studies, but also to psychoanalytic theory and film criticism. De Lauretis brings a unique and valuable perspective to issues of great importance today in all these areas."" —Leo Bersani</p>
<p>""De Lauretis’s influential theory gets top marks from sapphic scholars who know best."" —Out</p>
<p>In an eccentric reading of Freud through Laplanche and the Lacanian and feminist revisions, Teresa de Lauretis delineates a model of ""perverse"" desire and a theory of lesbian sexuality. The Practice of Love discusses classic psychoanalytic narratives of female homosexuality, contemporary feminist writings on female sexuality, and the evolution of the original fantasies into cultural myths or public fantasies.</p>"

<p>When Indian centenarian Chinnagounder asked<br>
 Deane Curtin about his interest in traditional medicine, especially since he wasn't<br>
 working for a drug company looking to patent a new discovery, Curtin wondered<br>
 whether it was possible for the industrialized world to interact with native<br>
 cultures for reasons other than to exploit them, develop them, and eradicate their<br>
 traditional practices. The answer, according to Curtin, defines the ethical<br>
 character of what we typically call 'progress.' Despite the familiar assertion that<br>
 we live in a global village, cross-cultural environmental and social conflicts are<br>
 often marked by failures of communication due to deeply divergent assumptions.<br>
 Curtin articulates a response to Chinnagounder's challenge in terms of a new,<br>
 distinctly postcolonial, environmental ethic.</p>"

Drawing out Leviathan: dinosaurs and the science wars,"['Parsons, Keith M.']","<p>""... are dinosaurs social constructs? Do we really know anything about dinosaurs? Might not all of our beliefs about dinosaurs merely be figments of the paleontological imagination? A few years ago such questions would have seemed preposterous, even nonsensical. Now they must have a serious answer.""</p>
<p>At stake in the ""Science Wars"" that have raged in academe and in the media is nothing less than the standing of science in our culture. One side argues that science is a ""social construct,"" that it does not discover facts about the world, but rather constructs artifacts disguised as objective truths. This view threatens the authority of science and rejects science’s claims to objectivity, rationality, and disinterested inquiry. Drawing Out Leviathan examines this argument in the light of some major debates about dinosaurs: the case of the wrong-headed dinosaur, the dinosaur ""heresies"" of the 1970s, and the debate over the extinction of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Keith Parsons claims that these debates, though lively and sometimes rancorous, show that evidence and logic, not arbitrary ""rules of the game,"" remained vitally important, even when the debates were at their nastiest. They show science to be a complex set of activities, pervaded by social influences, and not easily reducible to any stereotype. Parsons acknowledges that there are lessons to be learned by scientists from their would-be adversaries, and the book concludes with some recommendations for ending the Science Wars.</p>"

<p>Shimon Redlich draws on the historical record, his own childhood memories, and interviews with Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians who lived in the small eastern Polish town of Brzezany to construct this account of the changing relationships among the town’s three ethnic groups before, during, and after World War II. He details the history of Brzezany from the prewar decades (when it was part of independent Poland and members of the three communities remember living relatively amicably ""together and apart""), through the tensions of Soviet rule, the trauma of the Nazi occupation, and the recapture of the town by the Red Army in 1945.

Why choose the liberal arts?,"['Roche, Mark William.']","<p>""A wise and inspiring meditation on the value of an education in the liberal arts, one that is informed by long experience, enriched by mature reflection, and not neglectful of commonsense practicalities. It beckons as a kindly light amid the encircling gloom of so much contemporary commentary on American higher education."" —<b>Francis Oakley, President Emeritus, Williams College</b></p>
<p>""In a resistant country in a resistant age, Mark Roche dares to make the case for education in the liberal arts in terms both broad and deep. He makes forcefully the obligatory case for the practical value of a liberal arts education as a preparation for whatever profession—a case that must continue to be made, especially in these times. But on the basis of wide reading and long experience as a scholar, teacher, and administrator in institutions large and small, he straightforwardly makes the case for the inherent value of study in the liberal arts and for the intimate relationship between that study and what life might actually be about. He foregrounds the truly big questions that are so often avoided in pursuit of the professional by both students and faculty. Unlike so many commentators, he is not a scold. He is a thoughtful advocate for an education in which young and old alike explore together what it means to be a human being and how one might be a better one."" —<b>Don Michael Randel, President, The Andrew W.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world where the value of a liberal arts education is no longer taken for granted, Mark William Roche lucidly and passionately argues for its essential importance. Drawing on more than thirty years of experience in higher education as a student, faculty member, and administrator, Roche deftly connects the broad theoretical perspective of educators to the practical needs and questions of students and their parents.</p>
<p>Roche develops three overlapping arguments for a strong liberal arts education: first, the intrinsic value of learning for its own sake, including exploration of the profound questions that give meaning to life; second, the cultivation of intellectual virtues necessary for success beyond the academy; and third, the formative influence of the liberal arts on character and on the development of a sense of higher purpose and vocation. Together with his exploration of these three values—intrinsic, practical, and idealistic—Roche reflects on ways to integrate them, interweaving empirical data with personal experience. <b><i>Why Choose the Liberal Arts?</i></b> is an accessible and thought-provoking work of interest to students, parents, and administrators.</p>"

Love And Revolution: A Novel About Song Qingling And Sun Yat-sen,"['Ping Lu', 'Nancy Du']","<p>""Death is inevitably the end of a journey. Death also allows the journey to go back to the beginning.""</p>
<p>In this bold novel, one of Taiwan's most celebrated authors reimagines the lives of a legendary couple: Sun Yat-sen, known as the ""Father of the Chinese Revolution,"" and his wife, Song Qingling.</p>
<p>Born in 1866, Sun Yat-sen grew up an admirer of the rebels who tried to overthrow the ruling Manchu dynasty. He dreamed of strengthening China from within, but after a failed attempt at leading an insurrection in 1895, Sun was exiled to Japan. Only in 1916, after the dynasty fell and the new Chinese Republic was established, did he return to his country and assume the role of provisional president.</p>
<p>While in Japan, Sun met and married the beautiful Song Qingling. Twenty-six years her husband's junior, Song came from a wealthy, influential Chinese family (her sister married Chiang Kai-shek) and had received a college education in Macon, Georgia. Their tumultuous and politically charged relationship fuels this riveting novel. Weaving together three distinct voices&amp; mdash;Sun's, Song's, and a young woman rumored to be the daughter of Song's illicit lover&amp; mdash;Ping Lu's narrative experiments with invented memories and historical fact to explore the couple's many failings and desires.

<p>The distinguished American historian of Russian and Soviet science Loren R. Graham recounts with warmth and wit his experiences during 45 years of traveling and researching in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia, from 1960 to 2005. Present for many historic events during this period, Graham writes not as a political correspondent or an analyst, but as an ordinary American living through these years alongside Russian friends and critics. Graham befriended some of the leading scientists and politicians in Russia, but his most touching stories concern average Russians with whom he lived, worked, suffered, and exchanged views. Graham also writes of the ethical questions he confronted, such as the tension between independence of thought and political loyalty. Finally, he depicts the ways in which Russia has changed—visually, politically, and ideologically—during the last 15 years. These gripping, sometimes humorous, always deeply personal stories will engage and inform all readers with an interest in Russia during this tumultuous period of history.</p>"

Bug: The Strange Mutations Of The World's Most Famous Automobile,['Phil Patton'],"<p>""Herbie."" ""Punchbuggy."" ""Beetle."" The world's most recognizable automobile goes by many noms de plume. But did you know that the ""Love Bug"" was originally conceived as Hitler's ""car of the people,"" or that it was the Manson ""family""'s car of choice? Tapping into Americans' continuing obsession with the VW Bug, Phil Patton has written a kaleidoscopic history of the car from the 1950s to the 2000s. He describes the genius marketing strategy used in America to rid the car of its Fascist associations (VW hired a Jewish marketing team), and explains why designers are obsessed with its shape (the Bug, like the Pantheon, fits the Greek ""golden ellipse"" ideal of dimension). Patton posits that the Bug was the first car to cause Americans to ""wrap themselves in a brand as an extension of their ideology,"" and turn up their noses at the huge, showy cars produced in Detroit. Amazingly, it worked, and, based on the Beetle's continuing status as an American cultural icon, it still does.

How could I have known in 1990, when my husband and I purchased a simple little cabin with a few acres of land, how much this bit of earth and its accoutrements would penetrate my soul, and how it would clarify what I care about and stand for?"" —from the Prologue</p>
<p>For Ruth Ann Ingraham, spending part of her time in a cabin in the woods in southern Indiana becomes a journey of discovery—of herself and her place in the natural world. Suddenly freed from the urban daily grind, she is able to focus more intently on her surroundings. And she can look more deeply into herself and examine her beliefs.</p>
<p>As they settle into the place, the passing of each day offers up simple truths as Ruth Ann and her husband repair the cabin, learn the contour and texture of the land, and become ever more mindful of the animals and plants that share their living space. As the couple learn to walk in step with nature, they discover a depth and richness to life that has previously evaded them. In the hills of Brown County, Indiana, the author finds a fullness of life that survives even loss.</p>
<p>In addition to a text that is full of close observations of nature as well as thoughtful musings about life, Swimming with Frogs is beautifully illustrated with color photos and black and white drawings. It will appeal to naturalists of all stripes, fans of contemplative writing, and Brown County residents and visitors.</p>"

Patrick White Letters,['Patrick White'],"<p>""Letters are the devil, and I always hope that any I have written have been destroyed.""—Patrick White</p>
<p>Patrick White spent his whole life writing letters. He wanted them all burnt, but thousands survive to reveal him as one of the greatest letter-writers of his time. <i>Patrick White: Letters</i> is an unexpected and final volume of prose by Australia's most acclaimed novelist. Only a few scraps of White's letters have been published before.</p>
<p>From the aftermath of the First World War until his death in 1990, letters poured from White's pen: they are shrewd, funny, dramatic, pigheaded, camp, and above all, hauntingly beautiful. He wrote novels to sway a hostile world, but letters were for friends.</p>
<p>The culmination of ten years' work and reflection by David Marr, author of the well-received biography <i>Patrick White: A Life</i>, the volume tells the story of White's life in his own words. These are the letters of a great writer, a profound critic, a gossip with the sharpest eyes and tongue, a man who loved and hated ferociously, a keen cook, an angry patriot, and a believer never free of doubt.</p>
<p>""A literary milestone.""—<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>
<p>""Mean-spirited and brilliant, the 600 letters collected here offer real insight into the life of the Nobel-Prize winning Australian author. White's venom is matched by his torment, and the whole volume is redeemed by outstanding writing.""—<i>Publisher's Weekly</i> (""Best Books 96"")</p>

The book provides information essential to an understanding of the American approach to the current crisis in the region. The author's use of previously undisclosed materials and interviews with U.S. foreign policymakers gives the reader an inside look not only at the Rhodesian question but also at the politics of American foreign policy.</p>

Pop Internationalism (the Mit Press),['Paul Krugman'],"<p>""Pop internationalists"" — people who speak impressively about international trade while ignoring basic economics and misusing economic figures are the target of this collection of Paul Krugman's most recent essays. In the clear, readable, entertaining style that brought acclaim for his best-selling Age of Diminished Expectations, Krugman explains what real economic analysis is. He discusses economic terms and measurements, like ""value-added"" and GDP, in simple language so that readers can understand how pop internationalists distort, and sometimes contradict, the most basic truths about world trade.All but two of the essays have previously appeared in such publications as Foreign Affairs, Scientific American, and the Harvard Business Review. The first five essays take on exaggerations of foreign competition's effects on the U.S. economy and represent Krugman's central criticisms of public debate over world trade. The next three essays expose further distortions of economic theory and include the complete, unaltered, controversial review of Laura Tyson's Who's Bashing Whom. The third group of essays highlights misconceptions about competition from less industrialized countries.

The Case For Auschwitz: Evidence From The Irving Trial,['Robert Jan Van Pelt'],"<p>""The Irving case has done for the new century what the Nuremberg tribunals or the Eichmann trial did for earlier generations."" —The Daily Telegraph</p>
<p>From January to April 2000 a high-profile libel case brought by the British historian David Irving against Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt, charging that Lipstadt’s book, Denying the Holocaust (1993), falsely labeled him a Holocaust denier, was tried in the British High Court. The question about the evidence for Auschwitz as a death camp played a central role in these proceedings. Irving had based his alleged denial of the Holocaust in part on a 1988 report by an American execution specialist, Fred Leuchter, which claimed that there was no evidence for homicidal gas chambers in Auschwitz. In connection with their defense, Penguin and Lipstadt engaged architectural historian Robert Jan van Pelt to prepare for the court an expert report presenting the evidence for our knowledge that Auschwitz had been an extermination camp where up to one million Jews were killed, mainly in gas chambers.</p>
<p>Employing painstaking historical scholarship, van Pelt submitted an exhaustive forensic report, which he successfully defended in cross-examination in court. In his verdict in favor of the defendants, Mr. Justice Charles Grey concluded that ""no objective, fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz and that they were operated on a substantial scale to kill hundreds of thousands of Jews.""</p>
<p>The Case for Auschwitz analyzes why Auschwitz has become central to Holocaust denial and how it became a focus in the Irving-Lipstadt trial. It presents the compelling evidence contained in the original expert report and details the way this evidence played out at the trial. Unique in its comprehensive assessment of the historical evidence for Auschwitz and devastating in its demolition of the arguments of Holocaust deniers against Auschwitz, van Pelt’s book is essential reading for anyone interested in the history of the Holocaust and for those who seek to combat Holocaust denial.</p>"

"The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious, And Philosophical Conceptions Of Woman’s Nature (race, Gender, And Science)",['Nancy Tuana'],"<p>""This highly-readable work traces a set of beliefs about the nature of woman that have informed, and in turn have been reinforced by, science, religion, and philosophy from the classical period to the nineteenth century....

<p>""... an unusually readable account of the image of women from the Greeks to the nineteenth century, wedded to a highly interesting argument about the way religion and philosophy affect the direction of the work of scientists, and how the work of scientists is used by philosophers and clergy to give authority to the more abstract world of ideas."" —Magill Book Reviews</p>
<p>Provides a framework for understanding the persistence of the Western patriarchal view of woman as inferior.

"America, Its Jews, And The Rise Of Nazism","[""Arad, Gulie Ne'eman , 1946-""]","<p>""This meticulously researched and brilliantly argued account of American Jewry and the Nazi crisis is an outstanding achievement.... This is history at its best, a work of humane and balanced scholarship that unveils the nuances and ambiguities of the human experience. Framed within a compelling narrative, it is beautifully written with lucid restraint, yet deep compassion.... an essential corrective to an often misunderstood history."" —Saul Friedlander</p>
<p>What did American Jews do to help the threatened Jewish communities of Europe as the Nazi grip tightened in the 1930s? Why didn’t they do more to help Jews leave Europe and bring them to America? Probing these questions, Gulie Ne’eman Arad finds that, more than the events themselves, what was instrumental in dictating and shaping the American Jews’ response to Nazism was the dilemma posed by their desire for acceptance by American society, on the one hand, and their commitment to community solidarity, on the other. When American Jews were faced with the desperate plight of European Jews after Hitler’s accession to power, they were hesitant to press the case for immigration for fear of raising doubts about their own patriotism. In this gripping and thoroughly researched account, Arad contextualizes the American Jewish encounter with Nazism within the overall history of the American Jewish experience from the mid-19th century and offers a persuasive explanation of the ambivalent political response of American Jewish leaders in dealing with the Roosevelt administration.</p>"

Women In Science: Antiquity Through The Nineteenth Century: A Biographical Dictionary With Annotated Bibliography,['Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie'],"<p>""Was Marie Curie the only woman in science?"" This question, asked by a college student trying to write an essay on women in science, planted a seed that grew over a decade of research into this informative and accessible biographical dictionary and bibliography.At the heart of this biographical dictionary are profiles of 186 women whose work is representative of the participation of women in the science of their time and culture. Despite the increasing attention devoted to women's history in recent years, our knowledge of many of these women is still meager,and the book will serve as much as a guide to future research as a resource for historians,librarians, students, and the general public.The book opens with a substantial essay relating the general state of science and philosophical ideas about the role of women in society to the actual participation of women in science over the past two and a half millennia. The classified, annotated bibliography that completes the book can be used as a general research tool as well as a source of information about the particular women whose lives are sketched in this work.The entries provide basic information on their subjects, are referenced to primary sources and other materials in the bibliography, and share an easily flowing narrative style. Beyond that, the length, approach, and focus of the entries have been allowed to vary within an appropriate range to suit the particular women whose lives they recount and whose achievements they evaluate.Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie is a historian of science who teaches at Oklahoma Baptist University.</p>"
Cultural Universals And Particulars: An African Perspective (african Systems Of Thought),['Kwasi Wiredu'],"<p>""Wiredu's discussion of culturally defined values and concepts, as well as his attention to such timely issues as human rights, makes this book invaluable interdisciplinary reading."" —D. A. Masolo</p>
<p>Ghanaian philosopher Kwasi Wiredu confronts the paradox that while Western cultures recoil from claims of universality, previously colonized peoples, seeking to redefine their identities, insist on cultural particularities. Wiredu asserts that universals, rightly conceived on the basis of our common biological identity, are not incompatible with cultural particularities and, in fact, are what make intercultural communication possible. Drawing on aspects of Akan thought that appear to diverge from Western conceptions in the areas of ethics and metaphysics, Wiredu calls for a just reappraisal of these disparities, free of thought patterns corrupted by a colonial mentality. Wiredu's exposition of the principles of African traditional philosophy is not purely theoretical; he shows how certain aspects of African political thought may be applied to the practical resolution of some of Africa's most pressing problems.</p>"
Louis Johnson And The Arming Of America: The Roosevelt And Truman Years,"['Keith D. Mcfarland', 'David L.

Highly recommended."" —Douglas Brinkley, author of Dean Acheson: The Cold War Years and The Unfinished Presidency: Jimmy Carter’s Journey beyond the White House</p>
<p>""A remarkably objective, yet sympathetic, study of Louis Johnson’s life and career. Now only half-remembered,... Johnson was a major national figure. Colorful, aggressive, independent-minded, egotistical, his strong views and conflicts with Dean Acheson proved to be his undoing. All in all, a fascinating tale."" —James R. Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense</p>
<p>""McFarland and Roll have performed a real service in rescuing from obscurity this Democratic mover and shaker. Their account of the rise and fall of Louis Johnson provides us with the fullest depiction yet of an important Washington figure employed for better or worse as a blunt instrument of policy change by both Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman."" —Alonzo L. Hamby, author of Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman and For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s</p>
<p>""[Johnson’s] career is a cautionary tale of how even the most ruthlessly effective men can become pawns in the Washington power game. McFarland and Roll bring Johnson to life in this thorough and well-told history."" —Evan Thomas, Newsweek, author of Robert Kennedy: His Life and The Very Best Men: The Early Years of the CIA</p>
<p>Louis Johnson was FDR’s Assistant Secretary of War and the architect of the industrial mobilization plans that put the nation on a war footing prior to its entry into World War II. Later, as Truman’s Secretary of Defense, Johnson was given the difficult job of unifying the armed forces and carrying out Truman’s orders to dramatically reduce defense expenditures. In both administrations, he was asked to confront and carry out extremely unpopular initiatives—massive undertakings that each president believed were vital to the nation’s security and economic welfare. Johnson’s conflicts with Henry Morganthau, Secretary of War Harry H. Woodring, Winston Churchill, Harry Hopkins, Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman, and Paul Nitze find contemporary parallels in the recent disagreements between the national defense establishment and the State Department.</p>"

Writing Desire: Sixty Years Of Gay Autobiography (wisconsin Studies In Autobiography),['Bertram Cohler'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring nearly sixty years of memoir and autobiography, <i>Writing Desire</i> examines the changing identity of gay men writing within a historical context. Distinguished scholar and psychoanalyst Bertram J. Cohler has carefully selected a diverse group of ten men, including historians, activists, journalists, poets, performance artists, and bloggers, whose life writing evokes the evolution of gay life in twentieth-century America.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrasting the personal experience of these disparate writers, Cohler illustrates the social transformations that these men helped shape. Among Cohler's diverse subjects is Alan Helms, whose journey from Indiana to New York's gay society represents the passage of men who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s, when homosexuality was considered a hidden ""disease."" The liberating effects of Stonewall's aftermath are chronicled in the life of Arnie Kantrowitz, the prototypical activist for gay rights in the 1970s and the founder the Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. The artistic works of Tim Miller and Mark Doty evoke loss and shock during of the early stages of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Cohler rounds out this collective group portrait by looking at the newest generation of writers in the Internet age via the blog of BrYaN, who did the previously unthinkable: he ""outed"" himself to millions of people.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A compelling mix of social history and personal biography, <i>Writing Desire</i> distills the experience of three generations of gay America.</p>

Golpes bajos: instantáneas = Low blows : snapshots,"['Borinsky, Alicia.']","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these short, bilingual stories set in Buenos Aires (with each piece appearing in Spanish and English on facing pages), Alicia Borinsky provides unique glimpses into the lives of the city's inhabitants: its businessmen and tango dancers, politicians and torturers, triumphant divas and discarded children—a gallery of characters from a broad spectrum of contemporary Argentine society. She portrays a world of violence, corruption, love, and betrayal. The brevity of the pieces suggests a breathlessness and ephemeral quality, the fast-paced rhythm of the present. Yet within these small moments flicker the larger forces that shape ordinary lives. Civil wars are fought, shady deals are made, unwanted children are born. And in Borinsky's ironic but life-affirming prose, human foibles are exposed.</p>

Reel patriotism: the movies and World War I,"['Debauche, Leslie Midkiff.']","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixing film history with social history, <i>Reel Patriotism</i> examines the role played by the American film industry during World War I and the effects of the industry’s pragmatic patriotism in the decade following the war. Looking at such films as Joan the Woman and Wings and at the war-time activities of Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin, film distributors, including George Kleine, and the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, this book shows how heavily publicized gestures of patriotism benefited the reputation and profits of the movie business.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leslie Midkiff DeBauche shows how the United States government’s need to garner public support for the war, conserve food, raise money, and enlist soldiers was met by the film industry. Throughout the nineteen months of American involvement in World War I, film studios supported the war effort through the production of short instructional films, public speaking activities of movie stars, the civic forum provided by movie theaters, and the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry’s provision of administrative personnel to work directly with government agencies. While feature films about the war itself never dominated the release schedules of film distributors, they did become a staple film industry offering throughout the late 1910s and 1920s.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film industry had much to gain, DeBauche demonstrates, from working closely with the U.S. government. Though the war posed a direct challenge to the conduct of business as usual, the industry successfully weathered the war years. After the war, film producers, distributors, and exhibitors were able to capitalize on the good will of the movie-goer and the government that the industry’s war work created. It provided a buffer against national censorship when movie stars became embroiled in scandal, and it served as a selling point in the 1920s when major film companies began to trade their stock on Wall Street.</p>"
Death In A Prairie House: Frank Lloyd Wright And The Taliesin Murders,['William R. R. Drennan'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most pivotal and yet least understood event of Frank Lloyd Wright’s celebrated life involves the brutal murders in 1914 of seven adults and children dear to the architect and the destruction by fire of Taliesin, his landmark residence, near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Unaccountably, the details of that shocking crime have been largely ignored by Wright’s legion of biographers—a historical and cultural gap that is finally addressed in William Drennan’s exhaustively researched <i>Death in a Prairie House: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Murders.</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the scandal generated by his open affair with the proto-feminist and free love advocate Mamah Borthwick Cheney, Wright had begun to build Taliesin as a refuge and ""love cottage"" for himself and his mistress (both married at the time to others).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceived as the apotheosis of Wright’s prairie house style, the original Taliesin would stand in all its isolated glory for only a few months before the bloody slayings that rocked the nation and reduced the structure itself to a smoking hull.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplying both a gripping mystery story and an authoritative portrait of the artist as a young man, Drennan wades through the myths surrounding Wright and the massacre, casting fresh light on the formulation of Wright’s architectural ideology and the cataclysmic effects that the Taliesin murders exerted on the fabled architect and on his subsequent designs.</p>

Cleopatra's Wedding Present: Travels Through Syria (living Out: Gay And Lesbian Autobiographies),['Robert Tewdwr Moss'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cleopatra’s Wedding Present</i> is the rare book that captivates its reader from the first page. Like the best travel books, Robert Tewdwr Moss’s memoir of his travels through Syria resonates on many levels: as a profoundly telling vivisection of Middle Eastern society, a chilling history of ethnic crimes, a picaresque adventure story, a purely entertaining travelogue, and a poignant romance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tewdwr Moss, a brilliant young writer who was murdered in London the day after he finished this book, left this lyrical gem as his legacy. He adeptly captures an essence of the Middle East that is foreign to most of us, but which becomes real with his astute observations of the region’s culture and explosive politics. He conveys what so many westerners find both fascinating and frightening in the Middle East, making no attempt to mask circumstances that are appalling and dangerous while also exotic, beautiful, and sometimes very funny.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesopotamia, now present-day Syria, was part of Mark Anthony’s love gift to Cleopatra. Then and now, it is a land of mystery and love.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the Hollywood film industry responded to the dark economic conditions of the 1930s with escapist and non-topical films. The fascinating exception was the gangster film, through which the studios joined in the debate over the spiritual and economic health of the nation. <i>Little Caesar</i>, considered by many to be an architype of the genre, is one of the most memorable dramatizations of the discontent and alienation, the deep anxiety and hostility shared by millions of Americans during those dark years.</p>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain, Canada, and the United States share a liberal political culture but differ in their historical evolution and in the structure of their institutions.&nbsp; Each country, Merelman suggests, has developed a distinctive popular culture that shapes public opinion and stifles political debate in nationally specific ways.&nbsp; Different rhetorical devices and metaphors operate in each nation, he points out;&nbsp; in Britain, for example, the monarchy and party system serve as symbols of political reconciliation between the individual and the collectivity.&nbsp; Characterizing the United States as a culture of “institutionalized individualism” and Canada as a culture of emotionally tepid group conflict, Merelman finds Britain’s culture of group-based political debate the most successful in encouraging democratic participation.<br>

Between The Dying And The Dead: Dr. Jack Kevorkian's Life And The Battle To Legalize Euthanasia,"['Neal Nicol', 'Harry Wylie']","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Jack Kevorkian—the enigmatic and intrepid physician dubbed ""Dr. Death""—has for years declined public interviews about his life and the events that led him to be a vehement advocate of doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. But here, finally, is his own life story, as told to Neal Nicol and Harry Wylie.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Kevorkian gained international notoriety in the 1990s for his passionate advocacy of choice for terminal patients, who have increasingly won the right to decide the time, place, and method of their own death in several western countries. In 1998, he assisted Thomas Youk, a terminally ill patient suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, with a lethal injection that was broadcast on CBS's 60 Minutes. Immediately thereafter, Kevorkian was arrested, charged with second-degree murder, tried, and sentenced to 10-25 years in Michigan's maximum-security prison system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Dr. Kevorkian is in his late seventies and in failing health himself. He shares an eight-by-twelve-foot cell with another inmate in the Thumb Correctional Facility at Lapeer, Michigan. The unique story Prisoner Number 284797 shares far exceeds the battle to legalize euthanasia and end human suffering for terminal patients. ""Personal choice is really what it is all about.

The Man Who Would Marry Susan Sontag: And Other Intimate Literary Portraits of the Bohemian Era,['Edward Field'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before Stonewall,&nbsp;young Air Force veteran Edward Field, fresh from combat in WWII, threw himself into New Yorkâs literary bohemia, searching for fulfillment as a gay man and poet. In this vivid account of his avant-garde years in Greenwich Village and the bohemian outposts of Parisâs Left Bank and Tangier-where you could write poetry, be radical, and be openly gay-Field opens the closet door to reveal, as&nbsp;never been seen before, some of the most important writers of his time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are young, beautiful Susan Sontag sitting at the feet of her idol Alfred Chester, who&nbsp;shrewdly plotted to marry her; May Swenson and her two loves; Paul and Jane Bowles in their ambiguous marriage; Frank OâHara in and out of bed; Fritz Peters, the anointed son of Gurdjieff; and James Baldwin, Isabel Miller (<i>Patience and Sarah</i>), Tobias Schneebaum, Robert Friend, and many others. With its intimate portraits, Fieldâs memoir brings back a forgotten era-postwar bohemia-bawdy, comical, romantic, sad, and heroic.</p>"
And The War Came: An Accidental Memoir,['David Wyatt'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing mood of my early and Ann’s mid-fifties has been one of the sense of an ending, surely, but more than that, of a gathering urgency. . . . Fewer of the moments between us feel rehearsed, or forced. And now, just as we had begun to glimpse something like wisdom, glimmering over the horizon, the world smacks the hell out of us. I am strangely grateful, even so, if only for the felt return, in recent days, of the possibility of strong emotion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the terrorist attacks, a man begins writing down things said by his family and friends. The trauma appears to have marooned diarist David Wyatt in a shell-shocked present tense. But as he experiences all of the emotions of that fall, he is visited by deep memories that transform his daily journal-keeping into an ""accidental memoir,"" a narrative that reaches a surprising and moving conclusion on Thanksgiving Day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juggling the roles of English professor, restaurant owner, husband, father, son, and friend, Wyatt finds sustenance at the core of ordinary American life, resources at once so available and so elusive. Passionate about people, books, food, and landscapes present and lost—and absolutely unheroic—the voices summoned here counter the sanctimonious and the sentimental. Wyatt’s elegantly understated memoir reveals how the events of September 11 affected ordinary people and presents this anthology of thoughts, feelings, and interactions in a frank and immediate voice.</p>"

Rosa: The Life Of An Italian Immigrant (wisconsin Studies In Autobiography),['Marie Hall Ets'],"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life story of Rosa Cavalleri, an Italian woman who came to the United States in 1884, one of the peak years in the nineteenth-century wave of immigration. A vivid, richly detailed account, the narrative traces Rosa’s life in an Italian peasant village and later in Chicago. Marie Hall Ets, a social worker and friend of Rosa’s at the Chicago Commons settlement house during the years following World War I, meticulously wrote down her lively stories to create this book.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosa was born in a silk-making village in Lombardy, a major source of north Italian emigration; she first set foot in the United States at the Castle Garden immigrant depot on the tip of Manhattan. Her life in this country was hard and Ets chronicles it in eloquent detail—Rosa endures a marriage at sixteen to an abusive older man, an unwilling migration to a Missouri mining town, and the unassisted birth of a child, and manages to escape from a husband who tried to force her into prostitution. Rosa’s exuberant personality, remarkable spirit, and ability as a storyteller distinguish this book, a unique contribution to the annals of U.S. immigration.</p>"

"The Polish Economy: Legacies From The Past, Prospects For The Future","['Shen, Raphael.']","<p>.Economic reform measures introduced in Poland have been the most radical and ambitious in the newly free countries of Eastern Europe. In a short time that country has moved from a centrally planned economy to a free-market system. The ramifications and implications of these economic reforms are influencing economic thought and planning in other recently liberalized, formerly communist societies.</p>
<p>Raphael Shen asserts that measures taken to transform the Polish economy should be implemented over time rather than overnight, and should be moderate rather than radical. Throwing the centrally planned system out and replacing it with the free-market system instantly means that, in the short term at least, Poland will have no smoothly functioning system in place. The necessary economic infrastructure and basic institutions have had no time to develop. The contrived market system cannot function in a meaningful way. The current experience in Poland has already led to extensive disillusionment among Polish consumers and doubts among academicians. The Polish experience will be a valuable lesson in economics for students and decision makers. Shen's book valuable to students, teachers, and researchers in the areas of comparative economic systems, economic development, and economic history.</p>"
Our Right To Drugs: The Case For A Free Market,['Thomas Szasz'],"<p>.In Our Right to Drugs, Thomas Szasz shows that our present drug war started at the beginning of this century, when the American government first assumed the task of protecting people from patent medicines. By the end of World War I, however, the free market in drugs was but a dim memory, if that. Instead of dwelling on the familiar impracticality or unfairness of our drug laws, Szasz demonstrates the deleterious effects of prescription laws which place people under lifelong medical tutelage. The result is that most Americans today prefer a coercive and corrupt command drug economy to a free market in drugs.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Szasz stresses the consequences of the fateful transformation of the central aim of American drug prohibitions from protecting us from being fooled by misbranded drugs to protecting us from harming ourselves by self-medication--defined as drug abuse. And he reminds us that the choice between self-control and state coercion applies to all areas of our lives, drugs being but one of the theaters in which this perennial play may be staged. A free society, Szasz emphasizes, cannot endure if its citizens reject the values of self-discipline and personal responsibility and if the state treats adults as if they were naughty children. In a no-holds-barred examination of the implementation of the War on Drugs, Szasz shows that under the guise of protecting the vulnerable members of our society--especially children, blacks, and the sick--our government has persecuted and injured them. Leading politicians persuade parents to denounce their children, and encourage children to betray their parents and friends--behavior that subverts family loyalties and destroys basic human decency. And instead of protecting blacks and Hispanics from dangerous drugs, this holy war has allowed us to persecute them, not as racists but as therapists--working selflessly to bring about a drug-free America. Last but not least, to millions of sick Americans, the War on Drugs has meant being deprived of the medicines they want-- because the drugs are illegal, unapproved here though approved abroad, or require a prescription a physician may be afraid to provide. The bizarre upshot of our drug policy is that many Americans now believe they have a right to die, which they will do anyway, while few believe they have a right to drugs, even though that does not mean they have to take any. Often jolting, always stimulating, Our Right to Drugs is likely to have the same explosive effect on our ideas about drugs and drug laws as, more than thirty years ago, The Myth of Mental Illness had on our ideas about insanity and psychiatry.</p>"
The United States And Biological Warfare: Secrets From The Early Cold War And Korea,"['Stephen Endicott', 'Edward Hagerman']","<p>[The United States and Biological Warfare] is a major contribution to our understanding of the past involvement by the US and Japanese governments with BW, with important, crucial implications for the future.... Pieces of this story, including the Korean War allegations, have been told before, but never so authoritatively, and with such a convincing foundation in historical research.... This is a brave and significant scholarly contribution on a matter of great importance to the future of humanity.<br>
—Richard Falk, Albert G. Milbank Professor of International Law and Practice, Princeton University</p>
<p>The United States and Biological Warfare argues persuasively that the United States experimented with and deployed biological weapons during the Korean War. Endicott and Hagerman explore the political and moral dimensions of this issue, asking what restraints were applied or forgotten in those years of ideological and political passion and military crisis.</p>
<p>For the first time, there is hard evidence that the United States lied both to Congress and the American public in saying that the American biological warfare program was purely defensive and for retaliation only. The truth is that a large and sophisticated biological weapons system was developed as an offensive weapon of opportunity in the post-World War II years. From newly declassified American, Canadian, and British documents, and with the cooperation of the Chinese Central Archives in giving the authors the first access by foreigners to relevant classified documents, Endicott and Hagerman have been able to tell the previously hidden story of the extension of the limits of modern war to include the use of medical science, the most morally laden of sciences with respect to the sanctity of human life. They show how the germ warfare program developed collaboratively by Great Britain, Canada, and the United States during the Second World War, together with information gathered from the Japanese at the end of World War II about their biological warfare technology, was incorporated into an ongoing development program in the United States. Startling evidence from both Chinese and American sources is presented to make the case.</p>

Russian Reform / International Money (lionel Robbins Lectures),"['Yegor Gaidar', 'Karl Otto Pöhl']","<p><br>
 Departing from tradition, both Yegor Gaidar, former Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, and Karl Otto Pöhl, former Chairman of the German Bundesbank, were invited to give the 1993 Lionel Robbins Lectures. The experiences of each author reflect the vast economic changes spreading across Europe -- economic reform in the East and growing economic integration in the West. Gaidar helped launch Russian economic reforms in 1992; Pöhl fought the hyperinflation in Europe of the 1970s and 1980s and laid the groundwork for monetary stability in Western Europe. These lectures provide insight into how these leaders assessed the risks of their situations and used basic economic analysis to chart their courses.</p>
<p>Gaidar reviews the events that led up to the August coup in Russia to argue that gradualism was not a viable approach to economic reform. He describes the conditions and dilemmas of the time, observing that reform in Russia is as much a political puzzle as it is an economic challenge. He outlines the successes and present dangers and concludes with an optimistic assessment of Russia's prospects for reform.</p>
<p>Pöhl provides an insider's view of the efforts of the Group of Seven industrialized nations to stabilize exchange rates from the 1970s on. He describes the tension in one country between the goals of price stability and exchange rate stability. This leads to a discussion of how monetary union was proposed in Europe and why the movement has hit snags. An appendix provides more details on the objectives and proposed structure of European monetary integration.</p>

Eco-pioneers: Practical Visionaries Solving Today's Environmental Problems,['Steve Lerner'],"<p><br>
</p>
<blockquote>""For sustainability to move from theory to practice, it requires the dedication and creativity Steve Lerner discovered in his 10,000 mile odyssey. Like the road to sustainability itself, Steve's journey circles back to show that American virtures such as gumption, ingenuity and unyielding persistance can once again revolutionize the world.""<br>
 -- <b>Paul Hawken</b>, author of <i>The Ecology of Commerce</i></blockquote>
The idea for <i>Eco-Pioneers</i> came to Steve Lerner while he was attending the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Although he was moved by the vision of sustainable development evoked by citizens and officials at the summit, as a reporter he felt a need to put a human face on the rhetoric and find out what sustainable development actually looks like in the United States. He spent the next four years searching out what he came to call ""eco-pioneers""--the modern pathfinders who are working in the American pragmatic tradition to reduce the pace of environmental degradation. These practical visionaries are people who are willing to push the limits of whatever tools they can find for dealing with ecological problems. 
<p>Lerner provides case studies of eco-pioneers who are exploring sustainable ways to log forests, grow food, save plant species, run cattle, build houses, clean up cities, redesign rural communities, generate power, conserve water, protect rivers and wildlife, treat hazardous waste, reuse materials, and reduce both waste and consumption. Some of those profiled run businesses, some address environmental practices within their immediate community, and some combine their environmental concerns with social goals such as the creation of inner-city jobs. Together they are creating ways of living and working that many analysts believe to be essential to an ecologically sustainable future.</p>

El Camino: Walking To Santiago De Compostela,"['Hoinacki, Lee , 1928-']","<p><em>El Camino</em> (Spanish for ""the way"") is a day-by-day account of a modern American pilgrim's solitary walk from St. Jean Pied de Port in France, across the Pyrenees and northern Spain, to Santiago de Compostela, believed since medieval times to be the burial place of Saint James. During thirty-two days in 1993, Lee Hoinacki trod the 500-mile route followed by Europeans for over a thousand years, stopping each evening at pilgrim hospices, some centuries-old, to write in his diary. His reflections range from the historical examination of religious sensibility to analyses of modern developments in architecture and technology, from the theological understanding of place to the mentality of mountain bike riders. Readers share in the personal religious growth of a traditional Roman Catholic who, toward the end of his life, finds himself in the welcome company of those who walked the same <em>camino</em> during the past centuries. The constant interplay between pertinent anecdotes from well-chosen fellow pilgrims, both ancient and modern, and Hoinacki's experiences of contemporary Spanish customs and behavior gives the book a captivating timelessness and spiritual insight rarely found in other modern chronicles of the pilgrimage to Santiago.</p>"
"Japanese Schooling: Patterns Of Socialization, Equality, And Political Control","['Shields', 'James J. [editor]']","<p><em>Japanese Schooling</em> is organized around important crosspoints for understanding the historic roots and contemporary features of Japanese education. These include (1) socialization for discipline at home and in school; (2) the impact of university examinations on educational equality and moral development; and (3) centralized control and national identity. Written by leading American and Japanese scholars, <em>Japanese Schooling</em> is uniquely informative and comprehensive, with wide-ranging and critical analyses of sensitive issues and traditional educational questions. Among the topics that highlight both strengths and weaknesses are: nursery schooling, pupil violence in junior high schools, the reasons for high achievement levels in mathematics, the textbook controversy and teacher unionism, the role of large class size in teaching cooperative behavior, gender issues, and special education. As one reviewer said, “The book has no equal among recently published works which in comparison avoid sharp analysis and are narrowly focused.”</p>
<p>Another feature is the bibliography of more than 200 English-language sources on Japanese education published since 1972. It constitutes probably the most complete bibliographic research base currently available for those interesting in studying Japanese education. Overall, Japanese Schooling shows every promise of taking a place alongside Herbert Passin’s <em>Society and Education in Japan</em>, published in 1965 and long-considered the classic reference for understanding the interplay between contemporary educational issues and the permanent patterns of Japanese culture.</p>"

The Revenge Of History: Marxism And The East European Revolutions,['Alex Callinicos'],"<p><em>The Revenge of History</em> is a frontal assault on the widely accepted idea that the East European revolutions of 1989 mark the death of socialism.</p>
<p>Alex Callinicos seeks to vindicate the classical Marxist tradition by arguing that socialism in this tradition can only come from below, through the self-activity of the working class. Stalinism from this standpoint was a counterrevolution, erecting at the end of the 1920s a state capitalist regime on the ruins of the radically democratic socialism briefly achieved in October 1917. Callinicos argues that the collapse of Stalinism at the end of the 1980s is one aspect of a worldwide transition from nationally organized to globally integrated capitalism. The result is likely to be greater economic and political instability. Against this background socialism—in Marx's sense—is all the more necessary. Callinicos contends that Marx's vision of a classless communist society would be both practically feasible and profoundly democratic.</p>
<p>He concludes that the collapse of Stalinism should be less the moment to abandon socialism than to resume unfinished business.</p>"
The Robert Frost Handbook,['James L. Potter'],"<p><em>The Robert Frost Handbook</em> is intended to provide a student or general reader with the basis for a sound general comprehension of the poet and his work. It is both an introduction to Frost's poetry—in a biographical, historical, and critical context—and also a guide to further investigation of that poetry.</p>
<p>Part I provides a basic biography and an account of Frost's career as a poet, including analyses of the character and structure of his principle volumes of poetry. Account is taken of Frost's own statements about his life and work, major biographical studies including Lawrence Thompson's, and reactions to such studies by the poet and his acquaintances. A chronological table of the main events of Frost's life, notably publication dates, provides guideposts.</p>
<p>Part II is an overview of the poems, with references to leading scholarly findings and critical judgments. Professor Potter ""has tried to read the mind of the poet only as it appears in his poems in all its complexity and apparent inconsistency""—though this reading has been correlated with external evidence such as letters and known experiences. A tension between a secular view and a more religious one, between a ""dark"" sense of things and a more optimistic one, is explicated—with attention to the uncertain balance achieved in a few particular poems and in the entire corpus.</p>
<p>Part III shows Frost's relationship with Wordsworth, Emerson, and Thoreau, as well as his critical and creative concern with form, voice, and metaphor—revealing an informed, conscious artist in place of the mythic rustic sage and versifier. Part IV provides an annotated list of works by and about Frost. Selective rather than exhaustive, it is intended as a working bibliography. The thrust of the <em>Handbook</em> is that Frost's poems need and deserve the same devoted attention on the reader's part as the poet gave to his work.</p>"
A Rum Affair: A True Story Of Botanical Fraud,['Karl Sabbagh'],"<p><i>A Rum Affair</i> is an absorbing tale of scientific chicanery and academic intrigue—critically acclaimed and a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>Book Prize. In the 1940s, the eminent British botanist John Heslop Harrison proposed a controversial theory: Species of plants on the islands off the west coast of Scotland, he said, had survived the last Ice Age. His premise flew in the face of evidence that the last advance of the ice sheets extended well south of mainland Scotland, but he said he had proof—the plants and grasses found on the Isle of Rum—that would make his name in the scientific world. Harrison didn't anticipate, however, the tenacious John Raven, an amateur botanist who boldly questioned whether these grasses were truly indigenous to the area, or whether they had been transported there and planted. What seems at first a minor infringement of academic honesty soon becomes an enthralling tale of rival scientists and fraudulent science, a skillful whodunit that, in the hands of the talented Sabbagh, joins the ranks of the best narrative nonfiction.</p>"
American Caesars: Lives Of The Presidents From Franklin D. Roosevelt To George W. Bush,"['Hamilton', 'Nigel']","<p><i>American Caesars</i>&nbsp;takes a fresh look at the lives and careers of the twelve leaders of the American empire since World War II, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush. President by president, the noted biographer Nigel Hamilton strips away myths and wishful thinking to record our most recent presidents as they really were: leaders guiding the fortunes of an unruly empire, on a world stage. Hamilton relates and examines the presidents’ unique characters, their paths to Pennsylvania Avenue, their effectiveness as global leaders, and their lessons in governance, both good and bad. With uncompromising candor he looks at how these powerful men responded to the challenges that defined their presidencies—FDR’s role as a war leader, Harry Truman’s decision to mount a Berlin Airlift rather than pursue military confrontation with the Soviets, Lyndon Johnson’s undertaking of controversial Civil Rights legislation and his disastrous war in Vietnam, Jimmy Carter’s handling of the Iran hostage crisis, George H. W. Bush’s effectiveness in guiding the world during the collapse of the Soviet Union, and his son’s fateful invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as other salient episodes in modern American history. In the Suetonian manner, Hamilton also looks at the presidents’ private lives—some noble, some flawed, some deeply moving.</p>"
Becoming Jimi Hendrix,['Steven Roby'],"<p><i>Becoming Jimi Hendrix</i> traces “Jimmy’s” early musical roots, from a harrowing, hand-to-mouth upbringing in a poverty-stricken, broken Seattle home to his early discovery of the blues to his stint as a reluctant recruit of the 101st Airborne who was magnetically drawn to the rhythm and blues scene in Nashville. As a sideman, Hendrix played with the likes of Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner, the Isley Brothers, and Sam &amp; Dave—but none knew what to make of his spotlight-stealing rock guitar experimentation, the likes of which had never been heard before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1962 to 1966, on the rough and tumble club circuit, Hendrix learned to please a crowd, deal with racism, and navigate shady music industry characters, all while evolving his own astonishing style. Finally, in New York’s Greenwich Village, two key women helped him survive, and his discovery in a tiny basement club in 1966 led to Hendrix instantly being heralded as a major act in Europe before he returned to America, appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival, and entered the pantheon of rock’s greatest musicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Becoming Jimi Hendrix</i> is based on over one hundred interviews with those who knew Hendrix best during his lean years, more than half of whom have never spoken about him on the record. Utilizing court transcripts, FBI files, private letters, unpublished photos, and U.S. Army documents, this is the story of a young musician who overcame enormous odds, a past that drove him to outbursts of violence, and terrible professional and personal decisions that complicated his life before his untimely demise.</p>"
Breaking The Slump: Baseball In The Depression Era,['Charles C. Alexander'],"<p><i>Breaking the Slump</i> is the engrossing story of baseball during the 1930s, when the National Pastime came of age as a business, an entertainment, and a passion, and when the teams of the American and National Leagues fielded perhaps the greatest rosters in the history of the game. Whether as rookies, stars in their prime, or legends on the wane, Babe Ruth, Rogers Hornsby, Lou Gehrig, Hank Greenberg, Dizzy Dean, Ted Williams, and Joe DiMaggio all left their mark on the game and on the American imagination in the decade before America's entry into the World War II. In one remarkable year, 1934, the entire starting lineup of the American League All-Stars consisted of future Hall of Famers. This surfeit of talent provided much needed entertainment to a nation struggling through economic hardship on an enormous scale.</p>
<p>In the face of the Great Depression, noted baseball historian Charles C. Alexander shows, Organized Baseball underwent an array of changes that defined the structure and operation of the game well into the postwar decades. The 1930s witnessed the advent of night baseball, the flowering of an extensive and, in some cases, controversial minor-league system of ""farm clubs,"" and the exploitation of the relatively new broadcast medium of radio. Power brokers such as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and owners Branch Rickey and ""Colonel"" Jacob Ruppert oversaw these and other developments even as they retained other traditional aspects of the game. As it had since the 1880s, the reserve clause continued to limit the salaries and mobility of ballplayers, subjecting them to the will of ownership to a degree unfathomable today. And Organized Baseball remained racially segregated throughout the 1930s, as the Negro leagues operated largely beyond the notice of white baseball fans.</p>
<p>While tracing these and other organizational developments, Alexander keeps his focus on the daily experience of the ballplayers. What was it like for young men trying to make their way as professional ballplayers in an economy that offered few prospects for them otherwise? What kind of conditions did they have to deal with in terms of playing facilities, transportation, lodging, and relations with their employers? And what about the play itself? Alexander offers an expert appraisal of how the ballplayers and the quality of the game they played differed from today's.</p>
<p>Americans have periodically been reminded of baseball's extraordinary capacity to enrich and enliven the national spirit during hard times. Breaking the Slump is a vivid portrait of the great game and its cultural significance during America's hardest times.</p>

Cattle Lords And Clansmen: The Social Structure Of Early Ireland,['Nerys T. Patterson'],"<p><i>Cattle Lords and Clansmen,</i> Nerys T. Patterson provides an analysis of the social structure of medieval Ireland, focusing on the pre-Norman period. By combining difficult, often fragmentary primary sources with sociological and anthropological methods, Patterson produces a unique approach to the study of early Ireland—one that challenges previous scholarship.</p>
<p>Patterson begins by exploring the pastoral-agricultural base of Irish society to see how seasonal demands, especially of the cattle herds, shaped the social organization of the community. This approach provides insight into the daily life of the people and the annual cycles of their political and social relations. The book then examines kinship relations—focusing on such aspects as marriage, sexual relations, and the care of children and other dependents—and clientship, which was the power network built by wealthy cattle lords through the loan of cattle to supporters. Patterson illuminates the complex interweaving of legal status, economic worth, and social responsibility, which determined the individual’s “honor-price,” set requirements of hospitality, and both empowered and constrained the political order.&nbsp;This new edition includes a chapter on seasonal rhythm, material derived from Patterson’s post-1991 publications, and an updated bibliography.</p>"
Chosen among women: Mary and Fatima in medieval Christianity and Shi`ite Islam,"['Thurlkill, Mary F. , 1969-']","<p><i>Chosen among Women: Mary and Fatima in Medieval Christianity and Shiite Islam</i> combines historical analysis with the tools of gender studies and religious studies to compare the roles of the Virgin Mary in medieval Christianity with those of Fatima, daughter of the prophet Muhammad, in Shiite Islam. The book explores the proliferation of Marian imagery in Late Antiquity through the Church fathers and popular hagiography. It examines how Merovingian authors assimilated powerful queens and abbesses to a Marian prototype to articulate their political significance and, at the same time, censure holy women's public charisma. Mary Thurlkill focuses as well on the importance of Fatima in the evolution of Shiite identity throughout the Middle East. She examines how scholars such as Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi advertised Fatima as a symbol of the Shiite holy family and its glorified status in paradise, while simultaneously binding her as a mother to the domestic sphere and patriarchal authority.</p>
<p>This important comparative look at feminine ideals in both Shiite Islam and medieval Christianity is of relevance and value in the modern world. It will be welcomed by scholars and students of Islam, comparative religion, medieval Christianity, and gender studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thurlkill has produced a remarkable study, a model for comparative work in the history of religions. The book is original, well-researched, and shows great erudition. Thurlkill's original acumen is brought to bear on a rich and variegated topic that has for too long been ignored by specialists not willing to move beyond the confines of overly determined areas of research.“ —<b>Brannon Wheeler, United States Naval Academy</b></p>"
Crown and veil: female monasticism from the fifth to the fifteenth centuries,['Editor-jeffrey F. Hamburger; Editor-susan Marti; Translator-dietlinde Hamburger; Foreword-caroline Walker Bynum'],"<p><i>Crown and Veil</i> offers a broad introduction to the history and visual culture of female monasticism in the Middle Ages, from the earliest communities of Late Antiquity to the Reformation. Scholars from numerous disciplines offer a wide range of perspectives not to be found in any other single book on the subject, placing the art, architecture, literature, liturgy, religious practices, and economic foundations of these communities within a wide historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>Long considered marginal to mainstream history, nuns and canonesses in fact had a profound influence on medieval culture. Revered and admired as models of piety, they commanded considerable prestige and exercised a significant degree of political power. Whether acting as producers or patrons of art, nuns were widely celebrated for their imaginative accomplishments. Focusing on the visual culture of female monastic communities in the German Empire, Frankish Gaul, Langobard Italy, and Anglo-Saxon England, this volume underscores the richness of largely unfamiliar material and its role in shaping distinctive forms of religious life.</p>

Daughters Of Mother Earth: The Wisdom Of Native American Women (native America: Yesterday And Today (hardcover)),"['Barbara Alice Mann', 'Winona LaDuke']","<p><i>Daughters of Mother Earth</i> is nothing less than a new way of looking at history—or more correctly, the reestablishment of a very old way. It holds that for too long, elements unnatural to Native American ways of knowing have been imposed on the study of Native America. Euro-American discourse styles, emphasizing elite male privilege and conceptual linearity, have drowned out the democratic and woman-centered Native approaches. Even when the damage of western linearity is understood to occur, analysis of Native American history, society, and culture has still been relentlessly placed in male custody, following the western assumption that Euro-American men speak ably for all. This book seeks to redress that balance, allowing, as editor Barbara Alice Mann writes, the Daughters of Mother Earth to reclaim their ancient responsibility to speak in council, to tell the truth, to guide the rising generations through spirit-spoken wisdom.</p>
<p>The recovery of women's traditions is an important theme in this collection of essays that helps reframe Native issues as properly gendered. Thus, Paula Gunn Allen looks at Indian lifeways through the many stitches of Indian clothes and the many steps of their powwow fancy-dances. Lee Maracle calls for reconstitution of traditional social structures, based on Native American ways of knowing. Kay McGowan identifies the exact sites where woman-power was weakened historically through the heavy impositions of European culture, the better to repair them. Finally, Barbara Mann examines how communication between Natives east and west of the Mississippi came to be so deranged as to be dysfunctional, and outlines how to reestablish good east-west relations for the benefit of all.</p>"
Dogfight: The Transatlantic Battle Over Airbus,"['Mcintyre, Ian , 1931-']","<p><i>Dogfight</i> examines the intense rivalry of the past two decades between the European Airbus consortium and the major U.S. aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. From the Americans' point of view, Airbus has been heavily subsidized by its supporting governments--indeed nearly nationalized--and not exposed to the risks and disciplines of the market place. From the European perspective, Airbus has been a standard-bearer for European technological, manufacturing, and marketing prowess in the face of historical American industrial domination. This dispute has spilled over the bounds of the purely commercial and become a serious transatlantic trade issue.</p>
<p>Although there has been a certain amount of admiring writing about Airbus in Europe, there has been no previous attempt to weigh the issues even-handedly by exploring them on both sides of the Atlantic. Dogfight examines the roots of the conflict in the middle sixties and carries the story forward to the tentative agreement on some of the outstanding issues reached by the U.S. administration and the European Commission in the spring of 1992. In placing the controversy in its political and international context, the author has had access to many of the key players in the industry in both Europe and the United States and has interviewed a large number of politicians, officials, and senior airline and aircraft executives.</p>"
Fatal Freedom: The Ethics And Politics Of Suicide,['Thomas Szasz'],"<p><i>Fatal Freedom</i> is an eloquent defense of every individual's right to choose a voluntary death. The author, a renowned psychiatrist, believes that we can speak about suicide calmly and rationally, as he does in this book, and that we can ultimately accept suicide as part of the human condition. By maintaining statutes that determine that voluntary death is not legal, our society is forfeiting one of its basic freedoms and causing the psychiatric/medical establishment to treat individuals in a manner that is disturbingly inhumane according to Dr. Szasz. His important work asks and points to clear, intelligent answers to some of the most significant ethical questions of our time:</p>
<p>. Is suicide a voluntary act?</p>
<p>. Should physicians be permitted to prevent it?</p>
<p>. Should they be authorized to abet it?</p>
<p>The author's thoughtful analysis of these questions consistently holds forth patient autonomy as paramount; therefore, he argues, patients should not be prevented from exercising their free will, nor should physicians be permitted to enter the process by prescribing or providing the means for voluntary death.</p>
<p>Dr. Szasz predicts that we will look back at our present prohibitory policies toward suicide with the same amazed disapproval with which we regard past policies toward homosexuality, masturbation, and birth control. This comparison with other practices that started as sins, became crimes, then were regarded as mental illnesses, and are now becoming more widely accepted, opens up the discussion and understanding of suicide in a historical context. The book explores attitudes toward suicide held by the ancient Greeks and Romans, through early Christianity and the Reformation, to the advent of modern psychiatry and contemporary society as a whole. Our tendency to define disapproved behaviors as diseases has created a psychiatric establishment that exerts far too much influence over how and when we choose to die. Just as we have come to accept the individual's right to birth control, so too must we accept his right to death control before we can call our society humane or free.</p>


                        <p>The book contains no figures.
<p>This eloquent defense of every individual's right to choose a voluntary death will contribute greatly to the debates of some of the most significant ethical issues facing our society: physician-assisted suicide, psychiatric intervention for suicidal patients, and euthanasia.</p>

"Female Gladiators: Gender, Law, And Contact Sport In America",['Sarah K. Fields'],"<p><i>Female Gladiators</i> examines the legal and social history of the right of women to participate with men in contact sports. The impetus to begin legal proceedings was the 1972 enactment of Title IX, which prohibited discrimination in educational settings, but it was the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the equal rights amendments of state constitutions that ultimately opened doors. Despite court rulings, however, many in American society resisted—and continue to resist—allowing girls in dugouts and other spaces traditionally defined as male territories. When the leagues continued to bar girls simply because they were not boys, the girls went to court. Sarah K. Fields examines the legal and cultural conflicts over gender and contact sports that continue to rage today.</p>"
"Finding The Best And The Brightest: A Guide To Recruiting, Selecting, And Retaining Effective Leaders",['Peg Thoms'],"<p><i>Finding the Best and Brightest</i> proposes an approach to choosing leaders based on a set of criteria designed to align individual qualities with organizational or institutional goals. Peg Thoms challenges the popular trend in theory and practice toward transformational or visionary leadership, arguing instead that leadership must be developed in context; many organizations, for example, don't need visionaries as much as they need operational leaders, who get things done by focusing on present-day tasks, such as designing superior products and delivering exceptional customer service. This book provides guidance for how to recruit, select, and retain the right people for leadership positions at any level of the organization. Drawing from research conducted in the private, public, and non-profit sectors, Thoms features powerful examples of effective and ineffective leadership in a variety of situations, and sheds light on the complex relationships between leaders and those who follow them.</p>
<p>We all choose our leaders. We hire them to run our companies. We vote them into office. We appoint them to committees. We decide to work for, serve, and follow them. In fact, all leadership is relative; by taking direction or orders, going to bat or war, marching behind, listening, and agreeing, we are choosing to allow another individual to lead us. Whether the stage is a corporation, a country, a club, a school, or any other organization, effective leaders matter. Yet despite such high-profile examples of leadership disasters—from the California recall of Gray Davis to the fall of such business titans as Ken Lay and Sam Waksal—we continue to choose, hire, and elect poor leaders.</p>
<p><i>Finding the Best and Brightest</i> explores this phenomenon in business, politics, and other sectors of society, and proposes an antidote—an approach to choosing leaders based on a set of criteria designed to align individual qualities with organizational or institutional goals. Peg Thoms challenges the popular trend toward transformational leadership, which focuses on identifying universal characteristics, arguing instead that leadership must be developed in context. Many organizations, for example, need operational leaders who can focus on present-day tasks, such as designing superior products and delivering exceptional customer service, and not inspirational or visionary leaders, whose otherwise admirable qualities might be ill-suited to the challenges at hand. Outlining six typical leadership search scenarios—from school principal to hospital CEO—Thoms shows readers how to identify the traits and behaviors that are most essential for the position and how to structure interviews and other search techniques to elicit the most informative responses and home in on the best candidates. She also reminds us that many organizations fail not because they can't find good leaders but because they can't keep them, and offers strategies to promote leadership development. Whether you are an executive giving the nod to a new department head, a concerned citizen casting your vote for a municipal councilman, a club member choosing a new president, or an aspiring leader deciding which offer will provide the greatest growth opportunities, <i>Finding the Best and the Brightest</i> offers fresh insights on the dynamic relationship between leaders and those who follow them.</p>"
Freedom On My Mind,"['Marable, Manning', 'Frazier, Nishani.', 'Mcmillian, John Campbell.']","<p><i>Freedom on My Mind</i> reveals the richly diverse and complex experience of black people in America in their own words, from the Colonial era of Benjamin Banneker to the present world of Kweisi Mfume and Clarence Thomas. Personal correspondence, excerpts from slave narratives and autobiographies, leaflets, significant addresses and speeches, oral histories and interviews, political manifestos, and important statements of black institutions and organizations are brought together to form a volume that testifies to the boundless creative potential of black Americans in indefatigable pursuit of the dream of freedom.</p>
<p>Arranged thematically, the selections illustrate the politics of resistance -- as reflected through gender and sexuality, kinship and community, work and leisure, faith and spirituality. They also highlight the contributions of women to black identity, history, and consciousness, and offer excerpts from the work of some of the finest stylists in the African American canon. A general introduction as well as short introductions and bibliographies for each document further enhance the usefulness of the book for students and researchers.</p>

From Outlaw To Classic: Canons In American Poetry,['Alan Golding'],"<p><i>From Outlaw to Classic</i> presents a sweeping history of the forces that have shaped, and continue to shape, the American poetry canon. Students, scholars, critics, and poets will welcome this enlightening and impressively documented book.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent writings by critics and theorists on literary canons have dealt almost exclusively with prose; Alan Golding shows that, like all canons, those of American poetry are characterized by conflict. Choosing a series of varied but representative instances, he analyzes battles and contentions among poets, anthologists, poetry magazine editors, and schools of thought in university English departments.&nbsp; The chapters:<br>
• present a history of American poetry anthologies<br>
• compare competing models of canon-formation, the aesthetic (poet-centered) and the institutional (critic-centered)<br>
• discuss the influence of the New Critics, emphasizing their status as practicing poets, their anti-nationalist reading of American poetry, and the landmark textbook, Understanding Poetry by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren<br>
• examine the canonizing effects of an experimental “little magazine,” Origin<br>
• trace how the Language poets address, in both their theory and their method, the canonizing institutions and canonical assumptions of the age.</p>"
Glimmering Girls: A Novel of the Fifties,['Merrill Joan Gerber'],"<p><i>Glimmering Girls</i> tells the story of three extraordinary American women during a time of sexual and cultural repression. Francie and her friends Liz and Amanda are college students, coming of age intellectually, emotionally, and physically in a setting where men were forbidden entry to women's dorm rooms, and women were locked into those rooms after curfew. College life for women was governed by one simple, cardinal rule: Marry Before Graduation or Be Lost Forever. Any thirst for adventure was supposed to be satisfied by the occasional panty raid. Francie and friends, however, find all this hard to swallow, and they resist their appointed futures as elementary school teachers and holders of the precious MRS degree. Doing the unthinkable, the three move off campus to live in a house with three men-Liz's boyfriend and two handsome, mysterious Southern twins who fix foreign cars in a shop off campus. There the young women's rebellion against expectations deepens, and they begin the real-world education of pursuing their dreams. Francie yearns to be a writer, and is encouraged by her Russian literature professor. Then she meets Joshua, a talented and dedicated piano student, who presents the ultimate challenge: does she maintain her virtue, or give in to her sexual desires, finally breaking fully free of repressive respectability? Glimmering Girls follows Francie, Liz, and Amanda through this and other discoveries and adventures. Ultimately, each finds a way to live fully at a time when their entire culture seemed arrayed against them.</p>"
"Heroes And Villains: Essays On Music, Movies, Comics, And Culture",['David Hajdu'],"<p><i>Heroes and Villains</i> is the first collection of essays by David Hajdu, award-winning author of <i>The Ten-Cent Plague</i>, <i>Positively 4th Street</i>, and <i>Lush Life</i>. Eclectic and controversial, Hajdu’s essays take on topics as varied as pop music, jazz, the avant-garde,<br>
 comic books, and our downloading culture. The heart of <i>Heroes and Villains</i> is an extraordinary new piece of cultural rediscovery, original to this book. It tells the untold story of one of the most important—and, ultimately, one of the most tragic—figures in American popular music, Billy Eckstine. Through exhaustive new research, Hajdu shows how this great, forgotten singer, once more popular than Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, transformed American music by combining sex appeal, sophistication, and black machismo—in the era of segregation. The cost, for Eckstine, was his career—and nearly his life.</p>
<p>Other essays in this expansive book deal with topical and surprising subjects like Beyoncé, Bobby Darin, Kanye West, Marjane Satrapi, Woody Guthrie, Will Eisner, the White Stripes, Elmer Fudd, Elvis Costello, Harry Partch, Ray Charles, Joni Mitchell, and more.<i><br>

Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network Of Terror,['Rohan Gunaratna'],"<p><i>Inside Al Qaeda</i> examines the leadership, ideology, structure, strategies, and tactics of the most violent politico-religious organization the world has ever seen. The definitive work on Al Qaeda, this book is based on five years of research, including extensive interviews with its members; field research in Al Qaeda-supported conflict zones in Central, South and Southeast Asia and the Middle East; and monitoring Al Qaeda infiltration of diaspora and migrant communities in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Although founded in 1988, Al Qaeda merged with and still works with several other extremist groups. Hence Al Qaeda rank and file draw on nearly three decades of terrorist expertise. Moreover, it inherited a full-fledged training and operational infrastructure funded by the United States, European, Saudi Arabian and other governments for use in the anti-Soviet Jihad.</p>
<p>This book sheds light on Al Qaeda's financial infrastructure and how they train combat soldiers and vanguard fighters for multiple guerrilla, terrorist and semi-conventional campaigns in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, the Caucuses, and the Balkans. In addition, the author covers the clandestine Al Qaeda operational network in the West.</p>
<p>Gunaratna reveals:</p>
<p>how Osama bin Laden had his mentor and Al Qaeda founder, ""Azzam"", assassinated in order to take over the organization and that other Al Qaeda officers who stood in his way were murdered,</p>
<p>Al Qaeda's long-range, deep-penetration agent handling system in Western Europe and North America for setting up safe houses, procuring weapons, and conducting operations,</p>
<p>how the O55 Brigade, Al Qaeda's guerrilla organization, integrated into the Taliban,</p>
<p>how the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui forced Al Qaeda to move forward on September 11,</p>
<p>how a plan to destroy British Parliament on 9/11 and to use nerve gas on the European Union Parliament were thwarted,</p>
<p>how the Iran--Hezbollah--Al Qaeda link provided the knowledge to conduct coordinated, simultaneous attacks on multiple targets, including failed plans to destroy Los Angeles International Airport, the USS Sullivan, the Radisson Hotel in Jordan, and eleven US commercial airliners over the Pacific ocean,</p>
<p>that one-fifth of international Islamic charities and NGOs are infiltrated by Al Qaeda,</p>
<p>how the US response is effective militarily in the short term, but insufficient to counter Al Qaeda's ideology in the long-term.</p>
<p>Finally, to destroy Al Qaeda, Gunaratna shows there needs to be a multipronged, multiagency, and multidimensional response by the international community.</p>

Killing The Messenger: Journalists At Risk In Modern Warfare,['Herbert N. Foerstel'],"<p><i>Killing the Messenger</i> reveals the dangerous new face of war and journalism. Covering armed conflicts has always been dangerous business, but in the past, press heroes like Ernie Pyle and Edward R. Murrow faced only the danger of random bullets or bombs.

<p><i>Killing the Messenger</i> reveals the dangerous new face of war and journalism. Covering armed conflicts has always been dangerous business, but in the past, press heroes like Ernie Pyle and Edward R. Murrow faced only the danger of random bullets or bombs. Today's war correspondent is actually in the cross hairs, a target of combatants on all sides of conflicts.</p>
<p>In this book, correspondents describe the new dangers they face, and attempt to explain why they are targeted. Is it simply that modern combatants are more brutal than in the past, or has journalism changed, making correspondents players, rather than observers, in modern warfare? Extended interviews with correspondents who have been abducted and tortured during Middle East conflicts shed chilling light on this new face of war. These journalists, who have paid dearly to bring first-hand images of war to the public, offer some surprising insights into the nature and motivation of their kidnappers, and the reasons why reporters are targeted. They display no self-pity and little inclination to blame anyone other than themselves. At the same time, they are candid in describing the violence within Iraq and without. Ways to reduce the risks for reporters are discussed, but these editors and correspondents suggest that, short of withdrawing into isolated and protected enclaves, they may be facing an indefinite escalation of violence against journalists.</p>"
Kings In Their Castles: Photographs Of Queer Men At Home,"['Atwood, T.

In recounting her life's journey from Romania to Paris and Brussels, then on to the United States, Anca Vlasopolos writes movingly of the peculiar attributes of displacement in the contemporary world -- the hyphenated, ambiguous identities; the purgatory in which immigrants await transfer to another country; the mysterious nostalgia for places and events dimly recalled. Throughout, she describes the constant search for a place to truly call home.</p><p>Vlasopolos renders a clear and loving portrait of her mother, an Auschwitz survivor courageously raising a young girl by herself after the death of her husband, a political dissident.

Nuclear Insecurity: Understanding The Threat From Rogue Nations And Terrorists,['Jack Caravelli'],"<p><i>Nuclear Insecurity</i> is an insider's account of official American efforts to prevent the theft or diversion of nuclear and radiological weapons that could be used by rogue nations or terrorist groups. This perspective draws heavily from the author's work on the White House National Security Council Staff (1996-2000), where he was directly responsible to President Clinton for the development of U.S. nuclear material security policies and, subsequently, at the U.S. Department of Energy, where he directed the department's largest international nuclear security program, focused primarily on Russia.</p>
<p>In Caravelli's assessment, despite exceptional bipartisan political support and very high funding levels that have reached over $9 billion, a series of policy mistakes and programmatic bureaucratic missteps have badly compromised the United States government's efforts to protect against the spread of nuclear weapons and materials. The most striking example of the current situation is that the U.S. government, some 12 years after the start of these programs, still has failed to enhance the security of more than 300 metric tons of nuclear materials in Russia alone, enough to make hundreds of nuclear devices. The book concludes with recommendations and policy prescriptions for addressing some of these problems.</p>"
"Pursuing Melville, 1940-1980",['Jr Merton M. Sealts'],"<p><i>Pursuing Melville</i> collects fourteen representative chapters and essays out of nearly fifty pieces written between 1940 and 1980 by this influential Melville scholar, drawing also on his extensive correspondence of those years concerning Melville and Melvilleans. The selections range from a previously unpublished graduate seminar paper of 1940 through later articles and books to an authoritative study of Melville and the Platonic tradition composed especially for this volume. Presented chronologically, these writings reflect not only the development of Professor Sealts’s own thinking but also the direction taken by Melville scholarship generally over a period of forty years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book conveys its author’s evident love of his subject and the enthusiasm with which he has shared his findings, in his classroom and in his publications. A variety of readers can consult it with pleasure and profit—those making their first acquaintance with Melville and his works, more advanced students who are learning the methodology of literary study, and those scholars who deal professionally with American literature, American literary scholarship, and the cultural history of both the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his Preface observes, Professor Sealts has been an explorer of five recurrent themes: Melville’s reading, first in philosophy and then in general literature; his shorter fiction, from his magazine writing of the 1850s through <i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i>, the fruit of his last years; his three seasons of lecturing between 1857 and 1860; his relations with certain relatives, friends, and early biographers; and, along with all the rest, his distinctive temperament and personality, which are as enigmatic and alluring as the books he wrote.</p>"

Sex Talks To Girls: A Memoir (living Out: Gay And Lesbian Autobiog),['Maureen Seaton'],"<p><i>Sex Talks to Girls</i> chronicles the outward antics of a woman on an inward journey to self through the routes of religion, sex, sobriety, and kids. Recasting herself in this memoir as “Molly Meek,” Maureen Seaton interprets the emergence of Molly’s identity in luxurious and very funny prose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molly alternately finds herself in the surprising company of winos, swingers, and drag kings; in love with Jesus H. Christ and a butch named Mars; in charge of two children; writing stories that shrink painfully to poems without her permission; and incapable of figuring out how she landed in any of these predicaments. She is, by turns, a little saint, a Stepford wife, a bi-mom, and a femme with super powers. Her transformation—from near-nun to full-fledged sexual being, accidentally becoming conscious in the process and delighting in the spree—is the story of a life set on <i>play</i> and a woman heroically committed to seeing it through.</p>

Street Corner Society: The Social Structure Of An Italian Slum,['William Foote Whyte'],"<p><i>Street Corner Society</i> is one of a handful of works that can justifiably be called classics of sociological research. William Foote Whyte's account of the Italian American slum he called ""Cornerville""—Boston's North End—has been the model for urban ethnography for fifty years.</p>
<p>By mapping the intricate social worlds of street gangs and ""corner boys,"" Whyte was among the first to demonstrate that a poor community need not be socially disorganized. His writing set a standard for vivid portrayals of real people in real situations.

Survival Of The Black Family: The Institutional Impact Of U.s. Social Policy,['Karen S. Jewell'],"<p><i>Survival of the Black Family</i> critically examines the social policies that arose from the civil rights movement. Jewell proposes new steps to economic independence for black families that would place this responsibility within all sectors of society, arguing that social policies and their absence have affected the status of black family structures. She refutes the myths of significant black progress that emanated from the civil rights era, including the belief in equity for minorities in societal institutions. Attention is focused on the extent to which black families have been adversely affected by a process of assimilation, which was sociopsychological rather than economic. Jewell also discusses how neoconservatism in the 1980s has affected the status of black families. Finally, Jewell offers guidelines to the formulation of a social policy that could enhance the status of black families in the United States.</p>"

The Armenians: From Kings And Priests To Merchants And Commissars,['Razmik Panossian'],"<p><i>The Armenians</i> traces the evolution of Armenia and Armenian collective identity from its beginnings to the Armenian nationalist movement over Gharabagh in 1988. Applying theories of national-identity formation and nationalism, Razmik Panossian analyzes different elements of Armenian identity construction and argues that national identity is modern, predominantly subjective, and based on a political sense of belonging. Yet he also acknowledges the crucial role of history, art, literature, religious practice, and commerce in preserving the national memory and shaping the cultural identity of the Armenian people.</p>
<p>Panossian explores a series of landmark events, among them Armenians' first attempts at liberation, the Armenian renaissance of the nineteenth century, the 1915 genocide of the Ottoman Armenians, and Soviet occupation. He shows how these influences led to a ""multilocal"" evolution of Armenian identity in various places in and outside of Armenia, notably in diasporan communities from India to Venice. Today, these numerous identities contribute to deep divisions and tensions within the Armenian nation, the most profound of which is the cultural divide between Armenians residing in their homeland and those who live in the United States, Canada, the Middle East, and elsewhere. Considering the diversity of this single nation, Panossian questions the theoretical assumption that nationalism must be homogenizing.</p>
<p>Based on extensive research conducted in Armenia and the diaspora, including interviews and translation of Armenian-language sources, <i>The Armenians</i> is an engaging history and an invaluable comparative study.</p>

The Few,['Alex Kershaw'],"<p><i>The Few</i> tells the dramatic and unforgettable story of eight young Americans who joined Britain's Royal Air Force, defying their country's neutrality laws and risking their U.S. citizenship to fight side-by-side with England's finest pilots in the summer of 1940-over a year before America entered the war. Flying the lethal and elegant Spitfire, they became ""knights of the air"" and with minimal training but plenty of guts, they dueled the skilled and fearsome pilots of Germany's Luftwaffe. By October 1940, they had helped England win the greatest air battle in the history of aviation. Winston Churchill once said of all those who fought in the Battle of Britain, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."" These daring Americans were the few among the ""few."" Now, with the narrative drive and human drama that made <i>The Bedford Boys</i> and <i>The Longest Winter</i> national bestsellers, Alex Kershaw tells their story for the first time.</p>"
The First Time I Got Paid For It: Writers' Tales From The Hollywood Trenches,['Peter Lefcourt'],"<p><i>The First Time I Got Paid for It</i> is a one-of-a-kind collection of essays by more than fifty leading film and television writers, with a foreword by screenwriting legend William Goldman. Linked by the theme of a writer's ""first time""—usually the first time he got paid for his work, but sometimes veering off into other, more unconventional, ""first times""—these always entertaining (and sometimes hilarious) pieces share what it takes to succeed, what it takes to write well, and other aspects of maintaining creativity and integrity while striving for a career in Hollywood.

Nine of the best cartoon directors are featured: Friz Freleng, the creator of Speedy Gonzales, Yosemite Sam, and the Pink Panther; Ub Lwerks, the designer of Mickey Mouse and the wizard behind the first sound animated film, <i>Steamboat Willie</i>; Chuck Jones, the genius behind Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, the Road Runner and Coyote; William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who won seven Academy Awards for their Tom and Jerry cartoons; Bob Clampett, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons featuring Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, and Tweety; Tex Avery, who revolutionized the theory of cartoon-making, invented Daffy Duck, and introduced Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd to the screen; Walter Lantz, the creator of Woody Woodpecker; and Dave Fleischer, the father of Betty Boop and Popeye.Each chapter surveys the finest work of these directors and takes the reader behind the scenes to learn not only how they came up with their big ideas, but also how they managed to keep their characters fresh, topical, and unpredictable.

Jewish Radical Right: Revisionist Zionism and Its Ideological Legacy,['Eran Kaplan'],"<p><i>The Jewish Radical Right</i> is the first comprehensive analysis of Zionist Revisionist thought in the 1920s and 1930s, and of its ideological legacy in modern-day Israel. The Revisionists, under the leadership of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, offered a radical view of Jewish history and a revolutionary vision for its future. Using new archival material, Eran Kaplan examines the intellectual and cultural origins of the Zionist and Israeli Right, when Revisionism evolved into one of the most important movements in the Zionist camp. He presents revisionism as a form of integral nationalism, rooted in an ontological monism and intellectually related to the radical right-wing ideologies that flourished in the early twentieth century. Kaplan provocatively suggests that revisionism's legacies can be found both in the right-wing policies of Likud and in the heart of Post Zionism and its critique of mainstream (Labor) Zionism.</p><p>Published with support from the Koret Jewish Studies Program</p>"
Nutcracker Nation: How An Old World Ballet Became A Christmas Tradition In The New World,['Jennifer Fisher'],"<p><i>The Nutcracker</i> is the most popular ballet in the world, adopted and adapted by hundreds of communities across the United States and Canada every Christmas season. In this entertainingly informative book, Jennifer Fisher offers new insights into the <i>Nutcracker</i> phenomenon, examining it as a dance scholar and critic, a former participant, an observer of popular culture, and an interviewer of those who dance, present, and watch the beloved ballet.<br>
Fisher traces <i>The Nutcracker’s</i> history from its St. Petersburg premiere in 1892 through its emigration to North America in the mid-twentieth century to the many productions of recent years. She notes that after it was choreographed by another Russian immigrant to the New World, George Balanchine, the ballet began to thrive and variegate: Hawaiians added hula, Canadians added hockey, Mark Morris set it in the swinging sixties, and Donald Byrd placed it in Harlem. The dance world underestimates <i>The Nutcracker</i> at its peril, Fisher suggests, because the ballet is one of its most powerfully resonant traditions. After starting life as a Russian ballet based on a German tale about a little girl’s imagination, <i>The Nutcracker</i> has become a way for Americans to tell a story about their communal values and themselves.</p>"
The Power Of Religion In The Public Sphere (a Columbia / Ssrc Book),"['Judith Butler', 'Jürgen Habermas', 'Charles Taylor', 'Cornel West']","<p><i>The Power of Religion in the Public Sphere</i> represents a rare opportunity to experience a diverse group of preeminent philosophers confronting one pervasive contemporary concern: what role does—or should—religion play in our public lives? Reflecting on her recent work concerning state violence in Israel-Palestine, Judith Butler explores the potential of religious perspectives for renewing cultural and political criticism, while Jürgen Habermas, best known for his seminal conception of the public sphere, thinks through the ambiguous legacy of the concept of ""the political"" in contemporary theory. Charles Taylor argues for a radical redefinition of secularism, and Cornel West defends civil disobedience and emancipatory theology. Eduardo Mendieta and Jonathan VanAntwerpen detail the immense contribution of these philosophers to contemporary social and political theory, and an afterword by Craig Calhoun places these attempts to reconceive the significance of both religion and the secular in the context of contemporary national and international politics.</p>

Sensual Philosophy: Joyce And The Aesthetics Of Mysticism (central Asia Book),['Colleen M. Jaurretche'],"<p><i>The Sensual Philosophy</i> offers a richly illuminating reading of James Joyce's canon, placing his texts in the context of the medieval mystical tradition that had influenced and interested Joyce since his school days. In exploring Joyce's indebtedness to the artistic and theological culture of the Middle Ages, Colleen Jaurretche also identifies the origins of modernist aesthetics in medieval forms of representation.</p>
<p>Jaurretche follows the imprint of the ""negative"" mystical tradition—which seeks to surmount all human categories and sensations so as to encounter the divine—from its beginnings in the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite through its culmination in the sixteenth-century writings of St. John of the Cross. Joyce sees these ideas, she notes, in the intellectual tradition of late Victorian and early Modern writers, such as William Blake, Walter Pater, Francis Thompson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Oscar Wilde, and W. B. Yeats. She traces the development of Joyce's mystical aesthetic through a critical examination of his novels, culminating in the supreme negative mystical aestheticism of <i>Finnegans Wake.</i></p>"
The Sounds Of Commerce: Marketing Popular Film Music,"['Smith, Jeff , 1962 December 17-']","<p><i>The Sounds of Commerce</i> is the first book to present a detailed historical analysis of popular music in American film, from the era of sheet music sales, to that of orchestrated pop records by Henry Mancini and Ennio Morricone in the 1960• to the MTV-ready pop songs that occupy soundtrack CDs of today. Jeff Smith's landmark exploration of film and music cross-promotion investigates the combination of historical, economic, and aesthetic factors that brought about the rise of popular music in the movies.Smith employs a sophisticated yet accessible fusion of musicology, film theory, and social history. In one chapter, a musicological unpacking of the theme song from Goldfinger is used to show how the repeated refrain developed massive cultural appeal, leading to huge singles sales and a ubiquitous tune that most Americans can recognize several decades after the film's release. Other chapters look at how the film and music industries became so heavily intertwined, how soundtrack music progressed from orchestral score to pop song, and how certain soundtracks today become chart successes while their accompanying films generate scant box-office interest.Throughout the text, Smith persuasively argues that the popular film score has been as successful as its classical predecessor at enhancing emotions and moods, cueing characters and settings, and signifying psychological states and points of view. With <i>The Sounds of Commerce,</i> he challenges film music scholarship to recognize the significance of popular music in modern film.</p>

"Vietnam, We've All Been There: Interviews With American Writers",['Eric J. Schroeder'],"<p><i>Vietnam, We've All Been There</i> is a unique collection of interviews with noted American writers who made the Vietnam war a subject of their work. The writers represented here were chosen by Dr. Schroeder because their books, plays, poems and reportage are among the best of the particular genre in which each one works—Norman Mailer, David Rabe, and Michael Herr among them. Provocative not only for the opinions and memories of the interviewees, this book is also interesting for its focus on the variety of literary forms and styles that emerged from the Vietnam experience.</p>
<p>The author makes the point that the more successful literature to come out of the war was from writers who stretched the limits of particular forms, giving birth to narratives that broke all the rules. For example, where journalism usually demands facts, Michael Herr, the author of <i>Dispatches</i>, insisted on much more. He described psychological states, assessed personal losses and personified the war in ways that were radically different from accepted reporting. As Dr. Schroeder reminds us, Vietnam deeply affected everyone who lived through it—thus there were many cultural effects that still beg for examination and thought. He spent nine years gathering these interviews and during that time the war was a constant presence in his life. For many Americans even a lifetime may not make it possible to come to terms with the war. And while it is important not to forget where we've been, it is also important to move forward. In this book, the writers we hear from, like the works they created, help us to remember the past with a reflective wisdom that is essential to informing our future.</p>"

Women And Christianity (women And Religion In The World),['Kirk-duggan'],"<p><i>Women and Christianity</i> explores the experiences of women and how their daily lives interface with their spirituality and faith. Beginning with a historical overview, the book presents essays grouped under five broad headings: women, family, and environment; socioeconomics, politics, and authority; body, mind, and spirit; sex, power, and vulnerability; and women, world view, and religious practice.</p>
<p>These essays focus on multiple aspects of women's experiences and contemporary Christian realities, involving the interrelatedness of faith, thought, and activism across many strata of global society. They wrestle with the daily experiences and challenges women face integrating their lives as women of faith—as they are advocates, experience agency, and work for mutuality. It shows how in all these roles, women must negotiate power, injustice, and the impact of sexism as they work within systemic oppression amid a patriarchal system, nevertheless championing change and refusing to be severely compromised.</p>"

In Love And Struggle: Letters In Contemporary Feminism (gender And Culture Series),['Margaretta Jolly'],"<p><strong>Winner of the 2009 Feminist and Women's Studies Association Book Prize</strong></p>
<p class=""null1"">Do you think I can be a feminist mother? Did I make you and your kisses up in my mind? Will you join our military protest at the gate? Will you feed the kids when I'm in prison? Are you able to forgive me for breaking off this correspondence because you are a man?</p>
<p>During the women's movement of the 1970s and 1980s, feminists in the United States and Britain reinvented the image of the woman letter writer. Symbolically tearing up the love letter to an absent man, they wrote passionate letters to one another, exploring questions of sexuality, separatism, and strategy. These texts speak of the new interest women began to feel in one another and the new demands—and disappointments—these relationships would create.</p>
<p>Margaretta Jolly provides the first cultural study of these letters, charting the evolution of feminist political consciousness from the height of the women's movement to today's e-mail networks. Jolly uncovers the passionate, contradictory emotions of both politics and letter writing and sets out the theory behind them as a fragile yet persistent ideal of care ethics, women's love, and epistolary art. She follows several compelling feminist relationships sustained through writing and confronts the mixed messages of the ""open letter,"" which complicated political relations between women (such as Audre Lorde's ""Open Letter to Mary Daly,"" which called out white feminists for their implicit racism).</p>
<p>Jolly recovers the unsung literature of lesbianism and feminist romance, examines the ambivalent feelings within mother-daughter correspondences, and considers letter-writing campaigns during the peace movement. She concludes with a discussion of the ethical dilemma surrounding care versus autonomy and the meaning behind the burning or saving of letters. Letters that chart love stories, letters stowed away in attics, letters burnt at the end of romances, bittersweet letters written but never sent... this fascinating glimpse into women's intimate archives illuminates one of feminism's central concerns—that all relationships are political—and uniquely recasts a social movement in very emotional terms.</p>

Burning Questions: America's Fight With Nature's Fire,"['Carle, David , 1950-']","<p>A burning mix of diesel fuel and gasoline drips from handheld canisters onto the ground. Slowly a line of fire begins to creep downhill. The flames are well behaved, almost hesitant. This is a backing fire, unlikely to attract media attention unless it escapes, like the disastrous Los Alamos Cerro Grande fire did in 2000. This book explores a century of controversy over prescribed burning—using fire as a tool—and fire suppression. For more than 100 years, America waged an all-out war against wildland fire. Decades of fire suppression caused fuels to build up at alarming levels in our forests, culminating in the increasingly severe, uncontrollable fires of the late 20th century—the fires in Yellowstone, the Oakland Hills, and Los Alamos and the fires in summers of 2000 (the second worst fire season in the nation's history) and 2001.</p>
<p>Looking at these and earlier fires, Carle uses the voices of those who were involved, of those who were early advocates, and of today's proponents to examine the role of controlled burning. Early in the century, Harold Biswell, a pioneer in prescribed burning, dared to commit the heresy of questioning the dogma of fire suppression, despite professional controversy and opprobrium, he and a few other pioneers led the way. Their roles play an integral part in the story told here. In Biswell's words, fire is a natural part of the environment, about as important as rain and sunshine… . We must work more in harmony with nature, not so much against it. Can humanity, this book asks, learn to become a fire-adapted species?</p>"

It is a dramatic, whimsical, and literary work that also contains a number of Barnstone’s poems, which offer a second view of an event, a crystallization of his thinking, both sorrowful and joyful.

Straight Lick: The Cinema Of Oscar Micheaux,['J. Ronald Green'],"<p>A critical examination of the films of Oscar Micheaux.</p>
<p>One of the most original and successful filmmakers of all time, Oscar Micheaux was born into a rural, working-class, African-American family in mid-America in 1884, yet he created an impressive legacy in commercial cinema. Between 1913 and 1951 he wrote, directed, and distributed some forty-three feature films, more than any other black filmmaker in the world, a record of production that is likely to stand for a very long time.</p>
<p>Micheaux's work was founded upon the concern for class mobility, or uplift, for African Americans. Uplift provided the context for Micheaux's extensive commentary on racist cinema, such as D. W. Griffith's 1915 blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which Micheaux ""answered"" with his very early films Within Our Gates and Symbol of the Unconquered. Uplift explains Micheaux's use of ""negative images"" of African Americans as well as his multi-pronged campaign against stereotype and caricature in American culture. His campaign produced a body of films saturated with a nuanced intertexual ""signifying,"" boldly and repeatedly treating controversial topics that face white censorship time after time, topics ranging from white mob and Klan violence to light-skin-color fetish to white financing of black cultural productions.</p>"
Demagogue: The Fight To Save Democracy From Its Worst Enemies,['Michael Signer'],"<p>A demagogue is a tyrant who owes his initial rise to the democratic support of the masses. Huey Long, Hugo Chavez, and Moqtada al-Sadr are all clear examples of this dangerous byproduct of democracy. <i>Demagogue</i> takes a long view of the fight to defend democracy from within, from the brutal general Cleon in ancient Athens, the demagogues who plagued the bloody French Revolution, George W. Bush's naïve democratic experiment in Iraq, and beyond. This compelling narrative weaves stories about some of history's most fascinating figures, including Adolf Hitler, Senator Joe McCarthy, and General Douglas Macarthur, and explains how humanity's urge for liberty can give rise to dark forces that threaten that very freedom. To find the solution to democracy's demagogue problem, the book delves into the stories of four great thinkers who all personally struggled with democracy—Plato, Alexis de Tocqueville, Leo Strauss, and Hannah Arendt.</p>"

<p>Caio Fernando Abreu (1948-1996) was an award-winning journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and playwright who portrayed, as no other contemporary writer, the myriad contradictions of urban Brazil. His untimely death, as well as his courageous stand on AIDS and the growing popular interest in gay literature, will likely result in renewed attention to his playful yet urgent brand of postmodern writing.</p>

Jerome Kern (yale Broadway Masters Series),['Stephen Banfield'],"<p>A founding father of the modern American musical, Jerome Kern (18851945) was the composer of legions of popular songs, including such standards as “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” and “Ol’ Man River.” His 1927 <i>Show Boat</i> with Oscar Hammerstein II helped to set a new standard for musical theater.</p>
<p>This book is the first to provide a critical overview of Kern’s musical accomplishments throughout his career. Stephen Banfield ranges from Broadway, to Hollywood, and to London’s West End, drawing on unpublished manuscripts and scores to assess the composer’s extraordinary oeuvre.</p>
<p>Kern’s life, personality, and working methods are given due attention, as is the development of his work from the early musical comedies through the collaborations with Hammerstein and P. G. Wodehouse up to the later film scores. Banfield focuses especially on the musical and lyrical structures of Kern’s compositions, illuminating beloved works and shedding light on compositions often overlooked.</p>"

John Wilkes: The Scandalous Father Of Civil Liberty,"['Cash', 'Arthur']","<p>A highly entertaining biography of the incredible John Wilkes, champion of liberty and irrepressible libertine.<br>
""It is difficult to believe that John Wilkes, a notorious womanizer and scandal-monger, was a genuine hero of civil liberties and political democracy on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 18th century, but hero he was and in this engaging book Arthur Cash gives Wilkes the serious treatment he has long deserved.""—Eric Foner, Columbia University<br>

Back In The Day: My Life And Times With Tupac Shakur,['Darrin Keith Bastfield'],"<p>A legend after a bullet killed him at the age of twenty-five, Tupac Shakur was the most riveting rap musician of his day. Far from being the insolent ""gangsta"" the press put forth, Shakur was fiercely intelligent, fearless, and determined to make a mark. Darrin Bastfield grew up with him in a rough Baltimore neighborhood. In this vivid memoir, Bastfield reveals Tupac Shakur as the teenager he really was: bound for greatness.In tight, edgy prose, Bastfield recalls seven years of friendship. Shakur, new in town, a skinny thirteen-year-old in shabby clothes, may have looked uncool, but he blew the school away at a talent show, an electrifying performance. It was at the Baltimore School for the Arts, however, where things really started to happen-an encounter with Salt-N-Pepa, the wild night of the 1988 senior prom. Shakur and Bastfield lived through it together, and in this memoir, it all comes alive again.</p>"
"Love As Always, Kurt: Vonnegut As I Knew Him",['Loree Rackstraw'],"<p>A loving, intimate memoir from a lifelong friend of Kurt Vonnegut, including photos and never-before-published correspondence</p>
<p>When Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. ducked into his classroom at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop in September of 1965, his jokes drew only weak laughter and a few rolled eyes. But workshop student Loree Rackstraw was quietly impressed by this “great bear of a man” and his down-to-earth sensibilities about writing.</p>
<p>That fall, an impossible romance began between the then-unknown author and his student—a brief affair that matured into a joyful, lifelong friendship. Rackstraw distills four decades of memories and Vonnegut’s letters to her into an affectionate memoir that crackles with the creative energy of one of America’s most beloved writers.</p>
<p>Rackstraw’s unique perspective on Vonnegut’s life and how it shaped his famous works portrays a deeply humane man who looked for the humor and absurdity in life in order to survive. And then there are Vonnegut’s own letters: Whether energetic about new projects or frustrated with the “game” of writing and selling “a gazoolian copies,” Vonnegut writes with the playful imagination and generous, accessible brilliance that have always been his trademarks.<br>

Lingua Ex Machina: Reconciling Darwin And Chomsky With The Human Brain,"['William H. Calvin', 'Derek Bickerton']","<p>A machine for language? Certainly, say the neurophysiologists, busy studying the language specializations of the human brain and trying to identify their evolutionary antecedents.</p>
<p>Linguists such as Noam Chomsky talk about machinelike ""modules"" in the brain for syntax, arguing that language is more an instinct (a complex behavior triggered by simple environmental stimuli)than an acquired skill like riding a bicycle.But structured language presents the same evolutionary problems as feathered forelimbs for flight: you need a lot of specializations to fly even a little bit. How do you get them, if evolution has no foresight and the intermediate stages do not have intermediate payoffs? Some say that the Darwinian scheme for gradual species self-improvement cannot explain our most valued human capability, the one that sets us so far above the apes, language itself.William Calvin and Derek Bickerton suggest that other evolutionary developments, not directly related to language, allowed language to evolve in a way that eventually promoted a Chomskian syntax. They compare these intermediate behaviors to the curb-cuts originally intended for wheelchair users. Their usefulness was soon discovered by users of strollers, shopping carts,rollerblades, and so on. The authors argue that reciprocal altruism and ballistic movement planning were ""curb-cuts"" that indirectly promoted the formation of structured language. Written in the form of a dialogue set in Bellagio, Italy, Lingua ex Machina presents an engaging challenge to those who view the human capacity for language as a winner-take-all war between Chomsky and Darwin.</p>"
The world and the word: tales and observations from the Xhosa oral tradition,"['Zenani, Nongenile Masithathu.']","<p>A master storyteller of the Xhosa people of South Africa, Nongenile Masithathu Zenani gives us an unprecedented view of an oral society from within. Twenty-four of her complex and beautiful tales about birth, puberty, marriage, and work, as told to the renowned collector of African oral tradition, Harold Scheub, are gathered here. Accompanying the stories are Zenani’s detailed commentaries and analyses and Scheub’s striking photographs of her in performance.&nbsp; The combination of these historical and cultural observations with a richly symbolic collection of tales from a single traditional storyteller make The World and the Word a remarkable document.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The storyteller’s materials are simple,” Zenani told Scheub, “the world, and the word.” She presents to us the entire world of the Xhosa people, how they first came to be, the origins of their customs, how they order their world and deal with transgressors, how they manage all of life’s transitions from birth to death. She depicts both the world as it exists and as it is shaped in the words of the storyteller. Inheriting tales from the Xhosa tradition, Zenani has transformed them into imaginative new stories marked by her own artistry.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scheub’s introduction to The World and the Word discusses Xhosa oral tradition and Zenani’s particular characteristics as an artist within that tradition; Zenani’s personal history and her work as both a storyteller and a healer; and Scheub’s friendship with her and his role in recording her legacy.</p>"
The Playwright And The Pirate: Bernard Shaw And Frank Harris: A Correspondence,['Stanley Weintraub'],"<p>A more incongruous friendship than the one reflected in this correspondence is hard to imagine. Shaw is now remembered as the leading playwright of his time, and one of era's most memorable wits; Harris has become notorious for his near-pornographic <em>My Life and Loves</em>, and for a humorless (and disintegrating) sense of self-importance. At one time, Harris had been one of the later nineteenth century's most visible literary figures, a friend of such dissimilar people as Lord Randolph Churchill and Oscar Wilde, an editor of the <em>London Evening News</em> at 29, then editor of the <em>Fortnightly Review</em> and the <em>Saturday Review</em>, whose theater critic Shaw became. Never quite respectable, Harris had been tolerated—even courted—as an amiable vulgarian when he was a rising star. However, his booming voice and four-letter language, his inability to look like anything other than an Albanian highwayman even when dressed in tails, his gluttonous gormandizing and insatiable womanizing, quickly made him a pariah in Edwardian circles as his career began to slip and he began to snatch at shady quick-money opportunities.</p>
<p>Through these pages emerge the literary and political life of Edwardian and Georgian England, and wartime American, via Shaw's wit and ebullience and Harris's pomposity and paranoia.</p>"
"Information Arts: Intersections Of Art, Science, And Technology (leonardo)",['Stephen Wilson'],"<p>A new breed of contemporary artist engages science and technology—not just to adopt the vocabulary and gizmos, but to explore and comment on the content, agendas, and possibilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, proposes Stephen Wilson, the role of the artist is not only to interpret and to spread scientific knowledge, but to be an active partner in determining the direction of research. Years ago, C. P. Snow wrote about the ""two cultures"" of science and the humanities; these developments may finally help to change the outlook of those who view science and technology as separate from the general culture.In this rich compendium, Wilson offers the first comprehensive survey of international artists who incorporate concepts and research from mathematics, the physical sciences,biology, kinetics, telecommunications, and experimental digital systems such as artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. In addition to visual documentation and statements by the artists, Wilson examines relevant art-theoretical writings and explores emerging scientific and technological research likely to be culturally significant in the future. He also provides lists of resources including organizations, publications, conferences, museums, research centers, and Web sites.</p>"
The Gathering Biological Warfare Storm,"['Barry Schneider', 'Jim A. Davis']","<p>A new threat is stalking nations, as terrorist organizations and rogue states alike appear intent on acquiring and using the poor man's nuclear weapon: biological agents such as anthrax, smallpox, and plague. Attacks against Americans during the past dozen years may be an indication of more worrisome events to come. U.S. military forces in Japan were attacked in April of 1990 with botulinum toxin by the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Hundreds in Oregon were sickened with Salmonella after an attack in 1984. And small amounts of anthrax resulted in widespread panic and frequent evacuations across the United States in the fall of 2001. Ten experts discuss in detail the threats posed by bio-weapons and assess the current state of U.S. biological defenses.</p>
<p>Chapters highlight the future prospects for biological warfare, bio-weapons in the Middle East, potential agroterrorism, the emerging bio-cruise missile threat, prevalent myths and likely scenarios, as well as the public health response. The promise of future world peace after World War II was quickly shattered by the Cold War. Indeed, the nuclear age was born at a time when the world seemed to be emerging from a dark past into a hopeful future. Are we to repeat history? With the end of the Cold War, does the future hold even greater threats? Or is an old threat merely resurfacing with a new level of lethality? This book should be required reading for anyone interested in national security, as well as concerned citizens who wish to know what form this new enemy may take and what can be done to stop it.</p>"
Russian Crossroads: Toward The New Millennium,['Yevgeny Primakov'],"<p>A prominent Russian politician who served as prime minister, foreign minister, and head of foreign intelligence during the 1990s, Yevgeny Primakov has been part of all vital decisions on Russian domestic and foreign policy for the past two decades. His memoir is both an insider’s account of post-perestroika Russian politics and a statement from a representative of the enlightened Russian establishment on their nation’s relationship with America and the world.</p>
<p>Primakov is a specialist in the Middle East, and his personal involvement in the problems of that region make his commentary particularly valuable as he articulates Russia’s view of the conflicts there and its stance toward Iraq, Israel, and Palestine. Primakov also offers pertinent opinions on the Gulf War, NATO enlargement, spying, and other aspects of contemporary international relations, and he gives personal assessments of a wide variety of major players, from Saddam Hussein and Yassir Arafat to Madeleine Albright and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Providing behind-the-scenes information about government shake-ups in Moscow, the history of speculative privatizations, the formation of the new political and economic oligarchy, and much more, this book will be an invaluable aid to political analysts, historians, and anyone interested in Russia’s recent past and future plans.</p>"

The editors identified these essays from among several hundred articles published in recent years in leading American history journals and academic periodicals. Volume II picks up where volume I left off, continuing to focus on gender by examining the lives of African American men in the tumultuous period following the Civil War through the end of the nineteenth century. The writings included in volume two cover themes in the lives of black men that touch on leadership, work and the professions, family and community, sports and the military, and the image of black men in the larger society.</p>"
Education In Post-mao China,"['Lin, Jing.']","<p>A rare insider's view of educational development and problems in China since economic reform began in 1978, this volume critically examines the issue of political socialization through curriculum and compares the curriculum used during the Cultural Revolution with that compiled and used throughout China in 1988. Also explored are problems with student dropouts and teacher motivation in rural education and government-supported nonformal education; the tracking system and vocational education development in urban schools; problems that came about with economic and political reform; and the issue of inequality existing between and within rural and urban schools.</p>
<p>Turning to recent decentralization efforts in school administration, Jing Lin analyzes evidence suggesting that educational policy is politically controlled. Additionally, the development of educational research in the 1980s and 1990s constitutes the topic of one chapter, based on hundreds of published books and papers. Finally, Lin reflects on the massive student movement that arose in the spring of 1989 and delineates the social, economic, and political changes that sparked it. This final section treats these educational changes as an interconnected whole that underlay the movement and gave it such distinctive characteristics as nonviolence and a rational, constructive outlook.</p>"

No Child Left Different (childhood In America),['Sharna Olfman'],"<p>A stellar group of authors from across disciplines explains the alarming increase in the use of psychotropic medications, questions the causes, and presents disturbing thoughts regarding this phenomenon and the risks it creates for children. They take an in-depth look at the conditions that have led to drugging our children, and stress how emotional, social, cultural, and physical environments can both damage and heal young minds. And they challenge the model that maintains that psychological disturbance is genetic and thus requires medication. This is riveting reading for all who care about the youngest members of society.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, there has been a 300 percent increase in the use of psychotropic medications with girls and boys under the age of 20, and prescriptions for preschoolers have skyrocketed. A stellar group of authors from across disciplines explains this increase, questions the causes, and presents disturbing thoughts regarding this phenomenon as they describe the risks it creates for children. While there are certainly extreme cases where drugs are the only option, medication rather than psychotherapy and counseling has become the first choice for treatment rather than a last resort.</p>
<p>The experts who joined forces for this book take an in-depth look at the conditions that have led to drugging our children, and stress how emotional, social, cultural, and physical environments can both damage and heal young minds. The so-called medical model, one maintaining that psychological disturbance is genetic and thus requires medication, is challenged in this volume. Contributors range from a pediatrician who has testified before Congress and been featured in a <i>Time</i> magazine cover story, to a top child psychiatrist who is an official for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, along with a well-known child psychiatrist, psychologists, environmentalists, and a public policy consultant. This is riveting reading for all who care about the youngest members of society.</p>
<p>Among other issues, this work looks at controversy over whether psychiatric medications are safe or effective for children—and what little we know about their effect on still-developing brains—as well as the role of corporate interests in the increased use of psychotropics for children. Chapters address the role of environment in both causing and curing disorders more and more often diagnosed in our youngsters: from ADHD, depression, and anxiety to eating disorders. The core questions addressed by this sage group of contributors are these: Why are so many children being diagnosed with psychiatric disturbances and given drugs? Why have drugs become the first treatment of choice to deal with those disorders?</p>"

"The Caribbean Legion: Patriots, Politicians, Soldiers Of Fortune, 1946-1950",['Charles Ameringer'],"<p>A tale of adventure and intrigue, <em>The Caribbean Legion</em> studies the political struggles of the peoples of Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua in the years following World War II. Taking their inspiration from the D-day–style invasions of occupied Europe, groups of political exiles organized a series of armed expeditions that kept the Caribbean in turmoil for five years. Although their actions were independent, the groups became known collectively as the ''Caribbean Legion.''</p>
<p>Charles D. Ameringer examines the myth and reality of the Caribbean Legion, as well as the evolving foreign policy of the United States. Faced with the contradiction between the promotion of representative democracy and the principle of nonintervention, the United States tolerated dictatorship in the postwar Caribbean, which eventually led to serious consequences such as the Cuban Revolution.</p>
<p>Ameringer utilizes never-before-consulted documents from 1949 and 1950 on ''the situation in the Caribbean'' from the Inter-American Peace Committee of the Organization of American States. Accordingly, <em>The Caribbean Legion</em> presents new information and documentation on the difficulties, complexities, and costs of organizing armed uprisings from exile, the purposes and actions of pro-democratic Caribbean exiles and their allies and sponsors, and US policy toward Latin America in the early Cold War period.</p>

Richard Beer-hofmann: His Life And Work (the Penn State Series In German Literature),['Esther  N. Elstun'],"<p>A thorough account of Richard Beer Hofmann's profound influence on Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arnold Schnitzler, and other turn-of-the-century Viennese writers' lives and work has not appeared in nearly fifty years. This book fills that lacuna, placing Beer-Hofmann (1866–1945), the central member of the literary ground known as ""Young Vienna,"" in the context of his time and furnishing a fine critical discussion of all his major works. Beer-Hofmann's metamorphosis from a ""'decadent young dandy and aesthete"" into an artist ""whose Jewishness was central to his life and thought"" is described in the biographical first chapter; this growth provides the unifying thread for subsequent chapters, which focus on his prose and dramatic works.</p>
<p>This edition is not for Germanists alone; its ample quotations followed by English translations finally make Beer-Hofmann's work accessible to readers who have little or no command of the German language.</p>"
"The press and the origins of the cold war, 1944-1947",['Louis Liebovich'],"<p>A thoughtful interpretation of the roles of four print news media in the origins of the abrasive relationship between the Soviet Union and the US after WW II. It is based on a content analysis of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and <i>Time</i> magazine. Liebovich describes the idiosyncrasies in the staffs and leadership of each medium and links those unique characteristics to their positions on the Cold War. . . . Liebovich is a veteran newsman who has amassed excellent data to support his thesis. The writing is clear and concise. <i>Choice</i></p><p>This unprecedented study of the media's role during the early stages of the cold war focuses on four major news organizations: the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and <i>Time</i> magazine. Based on interviews with journalists who covered the news from 1944 to 1947, the book details the attitudes and predilections of the organizations involved and reveals the concerns of the writers themselves. The author rejects previously held views on the inevitability of the cold war--demonstrating that news coverage not only included but also reinforced popular images of the Soviet Union after World War II.</p>"
Pornography,['F. M. Christensen'],"<p>A unique and important book. I have never read any work which analyzes the subject in such a manner. This book is more thorough and has a more liberated point of view than others which attempt to tackle this 'hot potato' of the 1980s. Men should read this book. Women should read this book.</p><p><i>Karen DeCrow, former President, NOW</i></p><p>This study slices like a laser through all the fog of rhetoric, disinformation, bias, and fear that has long enveloped all discussions of the subject of pornography in the US. No argument in favor of the censorship of such material can be considered valid unless the basic arguments of this study are answered. . . . This is a valuable resource for all academic libraries and could well become a fundamental weapon in the war to preserve the First Amendment. This book should be purchased by all but the smallest libraries; it may well be the most honest discussion of the subject ever written. <i>Choice</i></p><p>In the continuing debate over pornography, two arguments stand out: that it is evil and should be censored, or that it is evil but censorship is a greater evil. F. M. Christensen presents the other side of this debate in what will surely be one of the most controversial books on the subject. Pornography: <i>The Other Side</i> convincingly argues that anti-pornography campaigns are themselves morally evil. The author defends this startling claim with a scientific persuasiveness. He successfully opens the pornography debate to include the whole picture, allowing the reader to grasp another side to this ongoing debate with concise, practical arguments. Students and scholars of all the social sciences, as well as the informed general reader, will find Pornography: The Other Side a source of stimulating ideas.</p><p>Christensen concludes that pornography itself is not the fundamental issue for those who oppose it. Vehement opposition to pornography, according to this book, is a symptom of tragically mistaken beliefs about sex. What this book is really about, writes the author, is sex--and the evil effects on the lives of all of us which irrational attitudes toward that subject continue to have.</p>"

A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Deviations from Deleuze and Guattari,['Brian Massumi'],"<p>A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia is a playful and emphatically practical elaboration of the major collaborative work of the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.

Finally, the dozens of explicit examples that Brian Massumi furnishes from contemporary artistic, scientific, and popular urban culture make the book an important, perhaps even central text within current debates on postmodern culture and politics.Capitalism and Schizophrenia is the general title for two books published a decade apart. The first, Anti-Oedipus, was a reaction to the events of May/June 1968; it is a critique of state-happy Marxism and school-building strains of psychoanalysis. The second,A Thousand Plateaus, is an attempt at a positive statement of the sort of nomad philosophy Deleuze and Guattari propose as an alternative to state philosophy.Brian Massumi is Professor of Comparative Literature at McGill University.</p>"

Satchmo: My Life In New Orleans,"['Armstrong, Louis , 1901-1971']","<p>”In all my whole career the Brick House was one of the toughest joints I ever played in. It was the honky-tonk where levee workers would congregate every Saturday night and trade with the gals who’d stroll up and down the floor and the bar. Those guys would drink and fight one another like circle saws. Bottles would come flying over the bandstand like crazy, and there was lots of just plain common shooting and cutting. But somehow all that jive didn’t faze me at all, I was so happy to have some place to blow my horn.” So says Louis Armstrong, a tough kid who just happened to be a musical genius, about one of the places where he performed and grew up. This raucous, rich tale of his early days in New Orleans concludes with his departure to Chicago at twenty-one to play with his boyhood idol King Oliver, and tells the story of a life that began, mythically, on July 4, 1900, in the city that sowed the seeds of jazz.</p>"

Remembrance Of Things I Forgot: A Novel,['Bob Smith'],"<p>“It’s safe to say your relationship is in trouble if the only way you can imagine solving your problems is by borrowing a time machine.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006 comic book dealer John Sherkston has decided to break up with his physicist boyfriend, Taylor Esgard, on the very day Taylor announces he’s finally perfected a time machine for the U.S government. John travels back to 1986, where he encounters “Junior,” his younger, more innocent self. When Junior starts to flirt, John wonders how to reveal his identity: “I’m you, only with less hair and problems you can’t imagine.” He also meets up with the younger Taylor, and this unlikely trio teams up to plot a course around their future relationship troubles, prevent John’s sister from making a tragic decision, and stop George W. Bush from becoming president.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this wickedly comic, cross-country, time-bending journey, John confronts his own—and the nation’s—blunders, learning that a second chance at changing things for the better also brings new opportunities to screw them up.

Out-of-wedlock Births: The United States In Comparative Perspective,['Mark Abrahamson'],"<p>Abrahamson focuses on the dramatic increase in out-of-wedlock births that occurred in the United States during the last half of the 20th century. He provides the most current demographic data, and summarizes the findings in a nontechnical manner made more meaningful by references to the lives of actual people.</p>
<p>He also includes detailed case studies of how out-of-wedlock births increased in rural Essex, England around 1600, in Madrid, Spain around 1800, and in Jamaica in the mid-20th century. A theoretical overview summarizes the patterns exhibited in the case studies and in the contemporary United States. He concludes with an examination of the role of welfare in the United States and the prospects for current welfare reform efforts to succeed in decreasing out-of-wedlock births. This survey will be of interest to scholars, students of sociology, anthropology, and social work, and readers interested in current social issues.</p>"
Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism,['Philip Kitcher'],"<p>Abusing Science is a manual for intellectual self-defense, the most complete available for presenting the case against Creationist pseudo-science. It is also a lucid exposition of the nature and methods of genuine science. The book begins with a concise introduction to evolutionary theory for non-scientists and closes with a rebuttal of the charge that this theory undermines religious and moral values. It will astonish many readers that this case must still be made in the 1980s, but since it must, Philip Kitcher makes it irresistibly and forcefully.Not long ago, a federal court struck down an Arkansas law requiring that ""scientific"" Creationism be taught in high school science classes. Contemporary Creationists may have lost one legal battle, but their cause continues to thrive. Their efforts are directed not only at state legislatures but at local school boards and textbook publishers. As Kitcher argues in this rigorous but highly readable book,the integrity of science is under attack. The methods of inquiry used in evolutionary biology are those which are used throughout the sciences. Moreover, modern biology is intertwined with other fields of science—physics, chemistry, astronomy, and geology. Creationists hope to persuade the public that education in science should be torn apart to make room for a literal reading of Genesis.Abusing Science refutes the popular complaint that the scientific establishment is dogmatic and intolerant, denying ""academic freedom"" to the unorthodox. It examines Creationist claims seriously and systematically, one by one, showing clearly just why they are at best misguided, at worst ludicrous.</p>"
Ivory Bridges: Connecting Science And Society,"['Sonnert, Gerhard , 1957-']","<p>According to a widespread stereotype, scientists occupy an ivory tower, isolated from other parts of society. To some extent this is true, and the resulting freedom to pursue curiosity-driven research has made possible extraordinary scientific advances. The spinoffs of""pure"" science, however, have also had powerful impacts on society, and the potential for future impacts is even greater.The public and many policymakers, as well as many researchers, have paid insufficient attention to the mechanisms for interchange between science and society that have developed since World War II. Ivory Bridges examines two such mechanisms: governmental science policy (often involving the participation of ""scientist administrators"") and scientists' voluntary public-interest associations.The examination of science policy is guided by the notion of""Jeffersonian science"" — -defined as basic research on topics identified as being in the national interest. The book illustrates the concept with a historical case study of the Press-Carter Initiative of the late 1970s and proposes that a Jeffersonian approach would make a valuable addition to future science policy. The book also looks at the activities of citizen-scientists who have organized themselves to promote the welfare of society. It shows that their numerous and diverse organizations have made major contributions to the commonweal and that they have helped to prevent science from becoming either too subservient to government or too autonomous. An extensive appendix profiles a wide variety of these organizations.</p>"
Cultural Amnesia: America's Future and the Crisis of Memory,['Stephen Bertman'],"<p>According to Bertman, just as an individual needs memories to maintain a sense of personal identity, so does a nation need them in order to survive. Like Alzheimer victims, however, today's Americans are rapidly losing a consciousness of history, and with it, a sense of national identity and direction.</p><p>Sixty percent of adult Americans don't know the name of the president who ordered the dropping of the first atomic bomb, 42% of college seniors can't place the Civil War in the right half-century, and 24% think Columbus discovered America in the 1500s. Meanwhile, more American teenagers can name the Three Stooges than the three branches of the federal government.</p><p>Applying the metaphor of Alzheimer's disease to our national state of mind, Bertman offers a chilling prognosis for our country's future unless radical steps for recovery are taken. He offers psychological insights into the nature of memory with perspectives on the meaning and future of democracy. With compelling evidence, the book demonstrates that cultural amnesia, like Alzheimer's disease, is an insidiously progressive and debilitating illness that is eating away at America's soul. Rather than superficially blaming memory loss on a failed educational system, Bertman looks beyond the classroom to the larger social forces that conspire to alienate Americans from their past: a materialistic creed that celebrates transience and disposability, and an electronic faith that worships the present to the exclusion of all other dimensions of time.</p>"
The Watchful Eye: American Justice in the Age of the Television Trial,['Paul Thaler'],"<p>According to Thaler, the presence of cameras in the courtroom is a pervasive technology that can affect public perceptions of the judicial process, change the behavior and attitudes of trial participants, and ultimately transform the sober process of justice into a media event designed for maximum public exposure. The author has interviewed more than 50 people--prominent journalists, academics, and members of the legal system--and brought together their observations in a fascinating historical and psychological profile of the televised courtroom. Thaler provides a historical overview and theoretical perspective, and discusses the new cable courtroom network and the current and continuing camera debate in New York City. He makes reference to the recent celebrated cases involving Amy Fisher, William Kennedy Smith, and Rodney King, then turns to an in-depth case study of the Joel Steinberg murder trial, including insights from the presiding judge, trial attorneys, witnesses, jurors, and the defendant himself, as well as journalists who covered the trial. The author concludes that the process of justice is slowly being turned into an entertainment vehicle, not unlike the show trials of bygone eras.</p>"

Implementing e-commerce strategies,['Mark J. Epstein'],"<p>After a decade of treating the topic of e-commerce with awe and confusion, we can now step back and analyze the subject more objectively. From launching an electronic storefront to managing complex supply chain operations, most companies have ventured into e-commerce; but even the best-run bricks-and-mortar enterprises have run into snags in the virtual world. Even mighty Wal-Mart, for example, took its website through several redesigns and sales strategies, and Borders eventually outsourced its Internet sales activites to rival, Amazon. Despite the horror stories of abysmal customer service, lost information, catastrophic meltdowns, and the excesses of the dot.com boom, the Internet is now an essential tool and medium for conducting business. Today, the key question is not whether your firm should invest in e-commerce, but how you can do so most profitably.</p><p>In <i>Implementing E-Commerce Strategies</i>, Marc Epstein goes beyond the hype to focus on the practical angles of designing, executing, and successfully managing an e-commerce strategy that works for your company. While many books have addressed the what and why of e-commerce, Epstein zeroes in on the elusive how. Showcasing the experiences of 32 companies (both successes and failures) in a wide variety of industries, he explores such issues as corporate culture and strong leadership from the executive suite, integrating e-commerce into corporate strategy, aligning goals, accountabilities, and performance metrics to support e-commerce initiatives, and building systems that can measure the value of your e-commerce investments. No business can avoid e-commerce-and its capacity for creating spectacular opportunities or wasting precious time and resources. How your firm handles these challenges may very well determine whether or not it will survive.</p>"
"The Struggle For Accountability: The World Bank, Ngos, And Grassroots Movements (global Environmental Accord: Strategies For Sustainability And Institutional Innovation)","['Jonathan A. Fox', 'L. David Brown']","<p>After a history of funding environmentally costly megaprojects, the World Bank now claims that it is trying to become a leading force for sustainable development. For more than a decade, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots movements have formed transnational coalitions to reform the World Bank and the governments that it funds. The Struggle for Accountability assesses the efforts of these groups to make the World Bank more publicly accountable.The book is organized into four parts. Part I describes the NGOs and grassroots movements that are the book's central focus. Part II presents case studies of four projects that provoked the emergence of transnational advocacy coalitions: Indonesia's Kedung Ombo dam, the Mt.</p>
<p>Apo geothermal plant in the Philippines, Brazil's Planaforo Amazon development project, and the remarkable campaign of Ecuador's indigenous people to influence national economic policy that led to their participation in the design of a development loan. Part III looks at the origins and politics of reform in four areas of broader World Bank policy: the rights of indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, water resources, and the World Bank's institutional reforms that are supposed to encourage public accountability. In the last section, the editors discuss issues of accountability within transnational coalitions and assess the impact of advocacy campaigns on World Bank projects and policies.Contributors : L.

Sports In The Lives Of Children And Adolescents: Success On The Field And In Life,"['Griffin, Robert S.']","<p>After being questioned by a parent about how sports affects children, Griffin examined the impact of sports on children and reflected upon his own experiences with sports. What effect does sports have on work habits, social skills, confidence, independence, and aspirations? Does a sports experience provide the foundation for achievement in school and later life? Is competition good or harmful? What about the effects of sports involvement on girls? What are the characteristics of good athletes? How can parents help their children be successful in sports?</p>
<p>Griffin shares with parents and other readers his investigations of the published research pertaining to these questions and offers his own experiences and analyses. He asserts that sports is best assessed as it relates to the central issues children and adolescents confront while growing up—the agenda of the childhood, as he calls it. Griffin's explorations lead him to an examination of schools, professional sports, race and class, and the popular media as they affect children's interest and involvement in sports. He also investigates the phenomena of achievement (not just in sports) and good parenting.</p>"
Shakespeare And Joyce: A Study Of Finnegans Wake,['Vincent John Cheng'],"<p>After God, Shakespeare created most, James Joyce wrote in Ulysses. The importance of Shakespeare in Ulysses has been often discussed and documented; that this royal bard is as central and omnipresent in <em>Finnegans Wake</em> has been roundly agreed upon by Joyce scholars, yet no printed volume has exhaustively investigated the topic. This study arrives, therefore, as a welcome and timely look into the assertion, as on critic put it, that ""<em>Finnegans Wake</em> is about Shakespeare.""</p>
<p>""Throughout his life,"" Dr. Cheng writes, ""Joyce was in the habit of comparing himself to England's national poet."" In the <em>Wake</em>, Shakespeare—his life, his plays and his characters—forms a ""dense and extensive matrix of allusion."" Part I of this book provides a critical and interpretative view of how Shakespearean influences and allusions illuminate the themes and meanings of the <em>Wake</em>; the chapters are arranged to follow general patterns of allusion and motif. Part II comprises explications of a thousand Shakespearean allusions in <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, recorded by page and line of the novel. Finally, Part III is a set of appendixes which list the Shakespearean allusions by play, act, scene, and line for easy reference.</p>"
Ordinary Miracles: Learning From Breast Cancer Survivors,"['Nathanson, S. David.']","<p>After nearly three decades of providing medical care for women and men facing breast cancer, surgeon S. David Nathanson calls the survival rates today an ordinary miracle. Ordinary because the vast majority of patients now do live at least 20 years after diagnosis due to enormous progress that has been made in medicine; and a miracle too because of the intangible qualities such as faith and hope that seem key to success in battling the disease. In this book, survivors describe their experiences, emotions, and means to overcome the disease.</p>
<p>S. David Nathanson is an esteemed, longtime surgeon who calls the survival rates today for women and men facing breast cancer nothing short of an ordinary miracle. Ordinary because the vast majority of patients live at least two decades after diagnosis, due to great advances that have been made in early detection, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. But also a miracle because we know that key elements for a woman or man succeeding in a personal battle against breast cancer include completely intangible qualities of courage, fortitude, trust, persistence, faith, and hope. Although science cannot completely explain it, a supportive network of family and friends with those qualities also empower patient survival and recovery. In these pages, Nathanson shares stories from his patients, teaching us about the experience of breast cancer and explaining how they found and fueled the will and power to defeat the disease.</p>
<p>Even surgeon Nathanson himself cannot fully describe what goes through the hearts and minds of breast cancer patients as they discover, deal with, and finally triumph over the diagnosis. So in this book he acts as a narrator, letting his ordinary yet miraculous cancer survivors tell their stories, certainly filled with fear of the known and unknown, and with pain, but opening up to courage, love, sometimes humor, and finally hope. It is hope that firms up their resilience; hope that initiates their fortitude. Hope is an important component of healing, says the surgeon. Seventy-one survivors, including one man, tell their stories to ilustrate every step of the experience.</p>"
After Philosophy: End or Transformation?,"['Kenneth Baynes', 'James Bohman', 'Thomas McCarthy']","<p>After Philosophy provides an excellent framework for understanding the most important strains of current philosophical work in North America, England, France, and Germany. The selections from the work of fourteen contemporary philosophers not only display the multiplicity of approaches being pursued since the breakup of any consensus on what philosophy is, but also help to clarify this proliferation of views and to spell out today's basic options for doing, or not doing,philosophy today. With a general introduction delineating what is in dispute between the different parties to the end-of-philosophy debates, brief introductions to the thought of each author, and suggestions for further reading following each selection, After Philosophy is ideally suited for use in any course that includes an overview of the bewildering variety of contemporary approaches to philosophy.The major sections and contributors are: I.

The Road to Democracy in Iran (Boston Review Books),"['Akbar Ganji', 'Abbas Milani', 'Joshua Cohen']","<p>Akbar Ganji, called by some Iran's most famous dissident, was a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But, troubled by the regime's repressive nature, he became an investigative journalist in the 1990s, writing for Iran's pro-democracy newspapers. Most notably, he traced the murders of dissident intellectuals to Iran's secret service. In 2000 Ganji was arrested,sentenced to six years in prison, and banned from working as a journalist. His eighty-day hunger strike during his last year in prison mobilized the international human rights community. The Road to Democracy in Iran, Ganji's first book in English, demonstrates his lifelong commitment to human rights and democracy. A passionate call for universal human rights and the right to democracy from a Muslim perspective, it lays out the goals and means of Iran's democracy movement, why women's rights trump some interpretations of Islamic law, and how the West can help promote democracy in Iran (he strongly opposes U.S. intervention) and other Islamic countries. Throughout the book Ganji argues consistently for universal rights based on our common humanity (and he believes the world's religions support that idea). But his arguments never veer into abstraction; they are rooted deeply in the realities of life in Islamic countries, and offer a clear picture of the possibilities for and obstacles to improving human rights and promoting democracy in the Muslim world. Since his release from prison in March 2006, Akbar Ganji has been traveling outside Iran, meeting with intellectuals and activists in the international human rights community. He is currently living in the United States.Ganji goes beyond religion, ethnicity, or nationality in recognizing universality of concepts such as democracy and human rights. Thus he brings Iran back to the world,allying himself with democratic elements in his country no matter what their creed, and drawing freely upon the writings of democratic thinkers in the West.-Azar Nafisi, author of Reading Lolita in Tehran</p>"
Alcoholics Anonymous As A Mutual-help Movement: A Study In Eight Societies,['Klaus Makela'],"<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has an estimated worldwide membership of two million. This collaborative study offers the first comprehensive look at AA as a social movement, a belief system, a model for small group interactions, and a truly international phenomenon. The international success of AA is evidence that a system of thought and a program of action developed in middle-class North America in the 1930s can be adapted and made relevant in cultural environments as diverse as the slums of Mexico City, the factory towns of Poland, and the farm villages of Switzerland.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The authors look at what actually happens in an AA meeting, how members interact, and how the AA model fits into widely varying cultural traditions. The book includes the early history of AA and its organizational principles, its international growth, and its present structure, finances, and membership. The chapters pay particular attention to the relationships of belief and action in AA, the role of written and oral tradition in the transmission of the beliefs, and cultural variations in the content of the belief system. Because AA is a mutual-help movement, the authors contrast it with professional health care of various kinds, including 12-step programs, and compare it with alternative mutual-aid organizations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book draws on an abundance of data, including surveys, observation, in-depth talks with members, and a wealth of unpublished documents pertaining to AA in Austria, Finland, Iceland, Mexico, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The authors analyze AA’s organizational guidelines as an innovative code of principles for non-hierarchic and non-bureaucratic social structures, and suggest that AA is the prototype for an emerging social form.</p>

"Holding The Line: The Eisenhower Era, 1952-1961 (america Since World War Ii)",['Charles C. Alexander'],"<p>Alexander sees the characteristic feature of the Eisenhower era as an effort to ""hold the line"" — against Communism, against big government, against intellectual challenge, against disruptive social change. The period 1952-1961 is examined in trenchant detail by the author, who focuses on domestic politics and foreign policy but also examines economic, social, intellectual, and cultural aspects of the period. He scrutinizes such features of the fifties as McCarthyism, the Korean conflict, Dulles's system of global alliances, the early involvement in Vietnam, the economic boom, the appearance of giant conglomerates, the emergence of Black protest, the gathering crisis of the cities, and the impact of the mass media on popular culture. This book is lively enough for general readers and students of American history since the Second World War, yet probing and scholarly enough to interest specialists.</p>"
Envy Of The Gods: Alexander The Great's Ill-fated Journey Across Asia,"['Prevas, John.']","<p>Alexander the Great accomplished more than any ordinary human could even hope to dream, yet at the end of his life, his empire, his army, and even his own life were unraveling. While the world knows well how the Macedonian king conquered the Persian Empire, few people know the full story of his decline and fall as he sought to bring the most remote areas of the Persian empire under his control.Alexander was a complicated mix of ruthless tyrant and incurable romantic. This schizophrenic interplay of conflicting psychic forces characterized his rise to power and was largely responsible for his downfall. In the last seven years of his life, Alexander the Great grew increasingly unpredictable, sporadically violent, megalomaniacal, and suspicious of friends as well as enemies. In the end Alexander the Great was not defeated by any external enemy but by himself. John Prevas brings this riveting story of the fall of Alexander to life with a compelling narrative informed by his personal retracing of much of the route trod by Alexander through what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.</p>"
Alien Winds: The Reeducation of America&#39;s Indochinese Refugees,['James W. Tollefson'],"<p>Alien Winds presents the first critical analysis of U.S. refugee processing centers in Southeast Asia. Based on twenty months of work in refugee camps from 1983-1986 and an analysis of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, this book challenges the widely held view that the refugee education program results in successful resettlement. The author contends that in its zeal to Americanize Southeast Asians, this program seeks to replace ties to their traditional community with a commitment to the myths of American success ideology and the moral principle of self-sufficiency. He concludes that the program actually disempowers the refugees by robbing them of their sense of community, and often their dignity. Without regard to skills or education, it prepares refugees for long term employment in dead end minimum wage jobs. Of particular interest to teachers of English as a second language and scholars in the fields of education, sociology, anthropology, and Southeast Asian studies, Alien Winds concludes with recommendations for overseas centers and domestic resettlement programs. From its inception the U.S. refugee resettlement program faced difficult questions: What are the main difficulties facing Southeast Asians in the United States? What do refugees need to know in order to resettle successfully? How should successful resettlement be defined? Should there be different notions of success for different groups of people? What values do Americans share? Must newcomers adopt these values? Alien Winds examines the American answers to these questions as they are formulated and conveyed to the refugees. It also explores the sources of these answers. To this end itexamines important assumptions about immigrants that originated in educational programs during the early part of this century. It further explores the aims and structures of the organizations which created and operate the processing centers. Finally, Alien Winds analyzes the role of the refugee program in America's shared memory of Vietnam.</p>"
Cultural Diversity In The Workplace: Issues And Strategies,['George Henderson'],"<p>All CEOs, managers, supervisors, training professionals, and educators must be able to effectively recruit, train, manage, and promote a culturally diverse work force. Unfortunately, few of them have been adequately trained to do so. Effective management of diversity is good business. It takes effective communication, conflict resolution, and the creation of an inclusive organizational culture to succeed. This comprehensive book helps administrators better understand the problems they face and how to deal with them by dispelling the myths and facing the realities of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Drawing on numerous examples of successful diversity initiatives, the book gives the reader a balanced view of distinct diversity interventions. Cross-cultural training programs are critiqued, along with specific methods for assuring quality in-service training activities. Self-administered quizzes, surveys, and critical incidents are included to allow the reader to gain self-insight and self-improvement. African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, women, older workers, employees with disabilities, foreign workers, and majority cultural groups are discussed in great detail. Theories and laws, as well as behavioral, cognitive, and affective strategies are among the topics presented.</p>"
Collected Shorter Plays,"[""Eugene O'Neill"", 'Robert Brustein']",<p>All of O’Neill’s themes and concerns find expression in his one-act plays. They are the dramatic equivalent of short stories. Here gathered in a single volume are nine one-act plays that span the playwright’s career—from the early sea plays to the Expressionist masterpiece <i>The Hairy Ape</i> to the eerie nocturnal monologue <i>Hughie</i>.<br>Included in this volume: <i>Bound East for Cardiff</i> <i> Fog</i> <i> Thirst</i> <i> The Long Voyage Home</i> <i> Ile</i> <i> The Moon of the Caribbees</i> <i> In the Zone</i> <i> The Hairy Ape</i> <i> Hughie</i></p>
The Psychology Of Well Being,['William Miley'],"<p>Along with biological and medical factors, psychological factors must also be considered in health and well being. Stress plays a major role in physical illness, and stress management is therefore critical to establishing good health and well being behavior. William Miley offers a biopsychosocial approach emphasizing the complex interactions between biologoical, psychological, social, and cultural factors. Lifestyles are a fertile ground for psychological intervention to maintain health and well being. This book focuses on contemporary lifestyle patterns offering positive behaviors to initiate and maintain healthy lifestyles and maintain well being.</p>"
Kafka,"['Murray, Nicholas.', 'Kafka, Franz']","<p>Although Franz Kafka (18831924) completed only a small number of works in his lifetime, perhaps no other author has had a greater influence on twentieth-century consciousness. This engrossing biography of the Czech novelist and short-story writer emphasizes the cultural and historical contexts of his fiction and focuses for the first time on his complex relationship with his father.<br>
Nicholas Murray paints a picture of Kafka’s German-speaking Jewish family and the Prague mercantile bourgeoisie to which they belonged. He describes Kafka’s demanding professional career, his ill health, and the constantly receding prospects of a marriage he craved. He analyzes Kafka’s poor relationship with his father, Hermann, which found its most eloquent expression in Kafka’s story “The Judgement,” about a father who condemns his son to death by drowning. And he asserts that the unsettling flavor of Kafka’s books—stories suffused with guilt and frustration—derives from his sense of living in a mysteriously antagonistic world, of being a criminal without having knowingly committed a crime.<br>
Compelling and empathetic, this book sheds new light on a man of unique genius and on his enigmatic works.</p>"
Inductive Inference And Its Natural Ground: An Essay In Naturalistic Epistemology,['Hilary Kornblith'],"<p>Although Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is generally thought of as a research area at the intersection of machine learning and computational logic, Bergadano and Gunetti propose that most of the research in ILP has in fact come from machine learning, particularly in the evolution of inductive reasoning from pattern recognition, through initial approaches to symbolic machine learning, to recent techniques for learning relational concepts. In this book they provide an extended, up-to-date survey of ILP, emphasizing methods and systems suitable for software engineering applications, including inductive program development, testing, and maintenance.Inductive Logic Programming includes a definition of the basic ILP problem and its variations (incremental, with queries, for multiple predicates and predicate invention capabilities), a description of bottom-up operators and techniques (such as least general generalization, inverse resolution, and inverse implication), an analysis of top-down methods (mainly MIS and FOIL-like systems), and a survey of methods and languages for specifying inductive bias.Logic Programming series</p>"
Nurturing Success: Successful Women Of Color And Their Daughters,['Essie Lee'],"<p>Although interest in mother/daughter relationships has led to a plethora of books on the subject, these books all consider situations found in the mainstream white population. In this book, relationships between mothers and daughters from 13 ethnic groups, including Asian, Black, Latino, and Native American, are explored. The voices of 17 highly successful mothers, in different stages of their life, and their 19 daughters are heard. The reader will learn of their values, intergenerational relationships, and the mother's influence as a role model. The research that confirms and validates these women's life stories is discussed. The book provides valuable insight into the issues facing minority women in the United States.</p>
<p>Although the women in these case studies come from diverse multi-ethnic backgrounds, they have all faced traditional and ethnic barriers and been able to achieve success, becoming role models for their daughters. The book is both a significant contribution to women's and ethnic studies, social sciences and education.</p>"
African Women And Children: Crisis And Response,['Apollo Rwomire'],"<p>Although research on the roles and status of women and children in Africa has expanded over the past two decades, there is still a lack of comprehensive, reality-based and sophisticated analyses and documentation of the important issues and debates in this area. This collection of original and thought-provoking essays remedies these shortcomings by providing an eclectic, informed, and contextualized account of the nature and consequences of the oppression and abuse of women and children in Africa. In addition, it provides a critical review of a broad range of policies and interventions that are being pursued by statutory and non-governmental organizations to improve the quality of life of these two groups. Based on survey data, case studies, literature reviews, and firsthand accounts, this collection brings together some of the most significant new contributions to our understanding of how and why African women and children are oppressed by society.</p>
<p>The contributors to this volume consist of a well-known team of scholars from the social sciences and humanities who are mostly citizens of several sub-Saharan countries. Together, their lively contributions cover a wide range of topics including a comparative critique of females and gender status, traditional institutions and violation of women's human rights, and unequal access to power. In addition, the contributors examine constraints upon women's participation in politics, the feminization of poverty, prostitution, patriarchy and marriage, the inadequacy of gender neutral policies in housing delivery systems, the impact of parental separation and divorce on children, child abuse, and child streetism.</p>"
When Memory Speaks: The Holocaust In Art,"['Toll, Nelly S.']","<p>Although the Holocaust represents one of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind, it is thought of by many only in terms of statistics—the brutal slaughter of over 6 million lives. The art of those who suffered under the most unspeakable conditions and the art of those who reflect on the genocide remind us that statistics cannot tell the entire story. This important and diverse collection focuses on the art expression from the inferno, documenting the Holocaust through sketches of camp life drawn surreptitiously by victims on scraps of paper, and through contemporary paintings, sculpture, and personal reflections. From an informative and comprehensive perspective, this book evokes a powerful response to the 20th-century catastrophe.</p>"
Pursuit Of Justices: Presidential Politics And The Selection Of Supreme Court Nominees,['David Alistair Yalof'],"<p>Although the Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominees is the most public part of the nomination process, the most critical phase—the initial selection of nominees—is usually hidden from view. In <i>Pursuit of Justices</i>, David Yalof takes the reader behind the scenes of what happens before the Senate hearings to show how presidents go about deciding who will sit on the highest court in the land. As Yalof shows, an intricate web of forces—competing factions within the executive branch, organized interests, and the president's close associates—all vie for influence during this phase of presidential decisionmaking.</p>
<p>Yalof draws on the papers of seven modern presidents, from Truman to Reagan, and firsthand interviews with key figures, such as Ramsey Clark, Edwin Meese, and President Gerald Ford. He documents and analyzes the selection criteria these presidents used, the pool of candidates from which they chose, their strategies, and the political pressures affecting their decisions, both successes and failures. Yalof also disputes much conventional wisdom about the selection process, including the widely held view that presidents choose nominees primarily to influence future decisions of the high court. In a substantial epilogue, Yalof offers insightful observations about the selections of Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>By focusing on a neglected area of presidential politics, Yalof offers a fascinating and unprecedented glimpse into the intricate world of executive branch decisionmaking and the Supreme Court appointment process as a whole.<br>

Alva Myrdal: the passionate mind,"['Hirdman, Yvonne , 1943-']","<p>Alva Myrdal, the scholarly partner and wife of Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, was an innovative social scientist and thinker in her own right. She helped to lay the intellectual foundations of Sweden's social welfare state, pioneered educational innovations, and became an activist for human rights. Her extensive disarmament efforts won her the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982. At the same time, she struggled with many of the issues that today's ambitious women still find challenging. Myrdal's published work and the choices she made in her life spoke to the tensions that these conflicts produced and to the ways she tried to reconcile them. Hers is a remarkable and dramatic story that transcends borders and has particular resonance today. Yvonne Hirdman's biography of Alva Myrdal has been published to great acclaim in Sweden. In it, she creates an intimate, impassioned portrait of one of the great women of the 20th century.</p>"
American Skinheads: The Criminology And Control Of Hate Crime (praeger Series In Criminology And Crime Control Policy),['Mark S. Hamm'],"<p>American Skinheads is the first criminological analysis of organized hate crime violence. Mark Hamm presents historical specificity for a modern theory of hate crime, then rigorously tests the theory with interview data derived from skinheads who have committed an array of violent acts against persons because of their race, religion, or sexual preference--people who are members of the classic outgroups of American society.</p>
<p>Part One traces the roots of the Skinhead Nation through the Beats, Mods, Hippies, and Punks in London, and then examines the rise of the Neo-Nazi Skinheads in the United States, including a look at Neo-Nazi offshoots (Romantic Violence, The Aryan Youth Movement), recruiters (Tom Metzger), and recruitment tools (<i>W.A.R. Magazine</i> and <i>Hotline</i>, electronic mail, <i>Race and Reason</i>), and appearances on the Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera shows. In Part Two, Hamm discusses the accepted sociological perspectives on terrorist youth subcultures (not gangs), then presents findings of his own study of 36 skinheads, including social and economic characteristics, psychological profiles, the role of skinhead girls, use of drugs and weapons, satanism, and neo-fascism. Part Three assesses the future for American Neo-Nazism and recommends steps for preventing skinhead terrorism.</p>"
Us Expansionism: The Imperialist Urge In The 1890s,['David Healy'],"<p>Americans, in viewing the globe in 1897, saw a world of empires that were dynamic and fast-growing. Western powers such as Germany, France, and particularly Great Britain were making colonial imperialism fashionable, and the United States, eager to flex its muscles as an emerging world power, was swept along with the European tide. One year later, the United States had truly established itself as a contender in the global game, victorious in a war with Spain and committed to imperialism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>US Expansionism</i>, David Healy examines this brief but important chapter in American history. Analyzing the various intellectual, cultural, and economic forces that engendered and shaped America’s imperialist drive, Healy also illustrates the key personalities involved, including the soon-to-be president, Theodore Roosevelt. A final section of the book examines the anti-imperialist opposition inspired by the new policy, and the ensuing debates about the proper role of American power.</p>"
Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology Of Nuclear Missile Guidance (inside Technology),['Donald Mackenzie'],"<p>Among books on the arms race, Donald MacKenzie's stands out for its welcome demystification of the ""black box"" of nuclear weapons technology. MacKenzie follows one line of technology - strategic ballistic missile guidance - through a succession of weapons systems to reveal the ordinary workings of a world that is neither awesome nor unstoppable. He uncovers the parameters, the pressures, and the politics that make up the complex social construction of an equally complex technology.MacKenzie argues that it is wrong to assume that missile accuracy (or any other technological artifact) is a natural or inevitable consequence of technological change. By fostering an understanding of how the idea of accuracy was constructed and by uncovering the comprehensible and often mundane processes that have given rise to a frightening nuclear arsenal, he shows that there can be useful and informed intervention in the social processes of weapons construction. He also shows in what sense it is possible, contrary to the common wisdom, to""uninvent"" technologies.Examining the technological politics of the transition from bomber to ballistic missile, MacKenzie describes the processes that transformed both air force and navy ballistic missiles from moderately accurate countercity weapons to highly accurate counterforce ones. He concludes that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has ever accepted the idea of deterrence as the public understands it.Inventing Accuracy is based on 140 interviews with guidance and navigation technologists, navy and air force military officers, and defense officials Robert McNamara, James Schlesinger, McGeorge Bundy, and John Foster. It brings to light the confluence of forces, both physical and social, that gave rise to a selfcontained system of missile navigation,and it discusses the major U.S. groups involved in the early development of inertial guidance and navigation.Donald MacKenzie has published a number of influential articles on statistics, eugenics,and missile technologies. He is Reader in Sociology at the University of Edinburgh.</p>"
"Yaqui Resistance And Survival: The Struggle For Land And Autonomy, 1821–1910",['Evelyn Hu-dehart'],"<p>Among Mexico's indigenous populations, the Yaqui Indians of Sonora have most successfully repelled threats to their identity, land, and community. Interested in explaining how the relatively ""small"" nation withstood four centuries of contact with white culture, Evelyn Hu-DeHirt focuses here on the Indians' response to shifting environmental pressures in the period 1820 to 1910—an increasingly violent, and ultimately decisive, chapter in their lives.</p>"
Europe's Physician: The Various Life Of Theodore De Mayerne,['Hugh Trevor-roper'],"<p>Among the papers of Hugh Trevor-Roper, who died in 2003, was a manuscript to which he had repeatedly turned for more than thirty years, but never published.&nbsp; Attracted by the diverse life and vivid personality of Sir Theodore de Mayerne (15731655), the most famous physician in Europe of his time, Trevor-Roper pursued him across national and intellectual frontiers to uncover the details of his extraordinary life.&nbsp;<br>
Exploring an array of English and European sources, Trevor-Roper reveals the story of the pioneering Swiss Huguenot doctor who mixed medicine with diplomacy, with political intrigue, with secret intelligence, and with artistic interests at the courts first of Henry IV of France and then of James I and Charles I of England. A true “renaissance man,” Mayerne’s interests were broad, and due to considerable conspiratorial talent, he became a participant in bluff and intrigue at the highest levels.<br>
The most ambitious and perhaps the most original of all Trevor-Roper's books, written in his luminous prose, this is a major work of political and intellectual history that presents a whole period in a fresh and vivid light.</p>"
"Principle B, Vp Ellipsis, And Interpretation In Child Grammar (current Studies In Linguistics)","['Rosalind Thornton', 'Kenneth Wexler']","<p>Among the universal principles are those known as the principles of the binding theory. These principles constrain the range of interpretations that can be assigned to sentences containing reflexives and reciprocals, pronouns, and referring expressions. The principle that is relevant for pronouns, Principle B, has provided a fertile ground for the study of linguistic development. Although it has long been known that children make certain kinds of errors that appear to contradict this principle, further experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the child does know the grammatical principle, but implements the pragmatic knowledge incorrectly. In fact, discoveries concerning children's knowledge of Principle B are among the most well-known in the study of language acquisition because of the dissociation between syntactic and pragmatic knowledge (binding versus reference).In this book the authors deepen and extend the results of years of developmental investigation of Principle B by studying the interaction of Principle B with verb phrase ellipsis and properties of the interpretation of empty pronouns in ellipsis—properties of""strict"" and ""sloppy"" interpretation. This is the first experimental study of these topics in the developmental literature. The striking results show that detailed predictions from the ""pragmatic deficiency"" theory seem to be correct. Many novel experimental results concern the question of how children interpret pronouns, including elided pronouns, and how they understand VP ellipsis. The authors present the necessary theoretical background on Principle B, review and critique previous accounts of childrens errors, and present a novel account of why children misinterpret pronouns. The book will thus be of interest not only to readers interested in the development of the binding theory, but to those interested in the development of interpretation and reference by children.</p>"

Animation In Asia And The Pacific,"['Lent, John A.']","<p>Animation has had a global renaissance during the 1990s, and nowhere is this more evident than in Asia. With the exception of China and Japan, most Asian nations are relatively new to this art form. Over the last decade, countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand, as well as China, have acted as major offshore production plants for North American and European studios. One of the spurs for this increase in activity has been the global growth of terrestrial, cable, satellite, and video systems, all demanding large menus of programming, including animation. A second spur has been the exceptional popularity that Japanese animé has enjoyed across Asia, Europe, and the United States.</p>
<p>Despite these developments, there has not been corresponding growth of a serious literature covering industrial and aesthetic issues about Asian animation, and the small amount of work that has been produced has not been published in English. Animation in Asia and the Pacific provides the first continent-wide analysis, delving into issues of production, distribution, exhibition, aesthetics, and regulation in this burgeoning field. Animation in Asia and the Pacific also offers vignettes of the fascinating experiences of a group of animation pioneers. The historical and contemporary perspectives derive from interviews, textual analysis, archival research, and participation/observation data.</p>"
The Big Bang Symphony: A Novel Of Antarctica,['Lucy Jane Bledsoe'],"<p>Antarctica is a vortex that draws you back, season after season. The place is so raw and pure, all seal hide and crystalline iceberg. The fishbowl communities at McMurdo Station, South Pole Station, and in the remote field camps intensify relationships, jack all emotion up to a 10. The trick is to get what you need and then get out fast.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least that’s how thirty-year-old Rosie Moore views it as she flies in for her third season on the Ice. She plans to avoid all entanglements, romantic and otherwise, and do her work as a galley cook. But when her flight crash-lands, so do all her plans.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mikala Wilbo, a brilliant young composer whose heart—and music—have been frozen since the death of her partner, is also on that flight. She has come to the Ice as an artist-in-residence, to write music, but also to secretly check out the astrophysicist father she has never met.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arriving a few weeks later, Alice Neilson, a graduate student in geology who thinks in charts and equations, is thrilled to leave her dependent mother and begin her career at last. But from the start she is aware that her post-doc advisor, with whom she will work in Antarctica, expects much more from their relationship.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the three women become increasingly involved in each other’s lives, they find themselves deeply transformed by their time on the Ice. Each falls in love. Each faces challenges she never thought she would meet. And ultimately, each finds redemption in a depth and quality of friendship that only the harsh beauty of Antarctica can engender.</p>

Programs To Reduce Teen Dating Violence And Sexual Assault: Perspectives On What Works,"['Arlene Weisz', 'Beverly Black']","<p>Arlene N. Weisz and Beverly M. Black interview practitioners from more than fifty dating violence and sexual assault programs across the United States to provide a unique resource for effective teen dating violence prevention. Enhancing existing research with the shared wisdom of the nation's prevention community, Weisz and Black describe program goals and content, recruitment strategies, membership, structure, and community involvement in practitioners' own words. Their comprehensive approach reveals the core techniques that should be a part of any successful prevention program, including theoretical consistency, which contributes to sound content development, and peer education and youth leadership, which empower participants and keep programs relevant.</p>
<p>Weisz and Black show that multisession programs are most useful in preventing violence and assault, because they enable participants to learn new behaviors and change entrenched attitudes. Combining single- and mixed-gender sessions, as well as steering discussions away from the assignment of blame, also yield positive results. The authors demonstrate that productive education remains sensitive to differences in culture and sexual orientation and includes experiential exercises and role-playing. Manuals help in guiding educators and improving evaluation, but they should also allow adolescents to direct the discussion. Good programs regularly address teachers and parents. Ultimately, though, Weisz and Black find that the ideal program retains prevention educators long after the apprentice stage, encouraging self-evaluation and new interventions based on the wisdom that experience brings.</p>"

Arthur Miller: His Life And Work,['Martin Gottfried'],"<p>Arthur Miller has been delivering powerful drama to the stage for decades with such masterpieces as <i>Death of a Salesman</i>. But, remarkably, no one has yet told the full story of Miller's own extraordinary life-a rich life, much of it shrouded from public view. To achieve this groundbreaking portrait of the artist and the man, the award-winning drama critic and biographer Martin Gottfried masterfully draws on his interviews with those who have known Miller throughout his personal and professional life, on Miller's voluminous lifelong correspondence, and on the annotated scripts and notebooks that reveal Miller's creative process in stunning detail. From Miller's childhood and adolescence in Depression-era New York City to his formative college years in Michiganfrom the numerous early professional rejections to the 1947 play All My Sons that established him as a voice to be reckoned withfrom his heroic defiance of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy years to his most unlikely pairing with Marilyn Monroe from political and social activism on the world stage to an extraordinary professional vitality even as he turns 88 in October 2003 (he is still writing plays, and stage revivals and film adaptations of his classics proliferate): here is a dazzling book-a literary event of the first order.</p>"
Hoffa (mit Press),['Arthur A. Sloane'],"<p>Arthur Sloane, as a Harvard graduate student, first met Jimmy Hoffa in 1962 and he has been fascinated by this powerful and contradictory figure ever since. Now, nearly three decades after that first encounter, Sloane has written the only comprehensive biography of the late Teamster leader, having been provided full access to Hoffa's family, friends, and professional associates.Hoffa is a rich and colorful portrait of one of the most influential figures in American labor. It covers in considerable detail all the facets of Hoffa's remarkable life and death: his rise to total dominance over the largest, strongest, and wealthiest union in American history; his near-Victorian personal habits; the legal problems that plagued his later years; and, of course, the shadowy events surrounding his presumed Mafia murder in 1975.Jimmy Hoffa's middle name was Riddle,and as Sloane points out, he was indeed a mass of contradictions. To many, Hoffa was a kind of latter-day Al Capone, the dictator-president of a corrupt and overly powerful Teamsters Union. To others, he was a devoted family man and a workaholic union leader, who was both amazingly accessible to his hundreds of thousands of truck driver constituents (""You got a problem? Call me. Just pick up the phone."") and hugely successful in improving working conditions for them. In fact, each of these perspectives, Sloane observes, is far too limited to tell the full story of this complicated man.Arthur A. Sloane is Professor of Industrial Relations at the University of Delaware. His previous books include Labor Relations (with F. Witney), the most widely used textbook in its field.</p>"
"Sixty, Sexy, And Successful: A Guide For Aging Male Baby Boomers","['Schwalbe, Robert.']","<p>As a psychotherapist who focuses on working with the issues that challenge midlife and older men, Robert Schwalbe feels that the 60s and beyond can be the most rewarding or the most miserable period in a man's life. An aging male baby boomer looking at 60 encounters very specific psychological and physical changes. The impact of these changes can be felt in relationship to others and in how a man sees himself in his world. Does he continue to fit in? In particular, how a man adapts to being in his 60s is an indicator of how he feels about living the rest of his life. Dr. Schwalbe knows from personal experience, as well as from his patients, the challenges produced by anxiety and depression in dealing with aging in a youth-oriented society. He looks at competition in the gym, sports field, financial and business arena, the political world to the social and sexual world and urges men to adapt to the outside forces. The key is in the expectations and how to recognize and plan for them. Candid and straightforward talk with vignettes drawn from Dr. Schwalbe's practice illustrate problems and solutions related to marriage, relationships, career, retirement (don't, he urges), divorce, death of a partner, fitness, nutrition, sexual behavior, dealing with adult children, lifestyle changes, financial planning, ageism, and many other topics.</p>
<p>Schwalbe presents a heart-felt and therapeutically tested guide to keeping things in perspective in order to maintain self confidence and self esteem. Most importantly, this book is directed to the aging male baby boomer (and to those who love him, know him, or live with him). It tells him that he is not alone and that the intimate thoughts that he has about his aging body and mind are shared by millions of men who are in their 60s and are dealing with their new age.</p>"
The Limits Of Principle: Deciding Who Lives And What Dies (university Of Utah Anthropological),['Tom Koch'],"<p>As a society, we are faced with a series of dilemmas—abortion, euthanasia, genetic engineering, organ transplant allocation, support or non-support of the elderly and fragile—that seem to offer no resolution. How do we choose between the needy and the ailing? Choices must be made in both the world of law and the realm of medical ethics. What we need is what we do not have—a perspective in the larger sense of the word—a view that makes apparent the sweep of the issues at hand. The failure of perspective in bioethics and medical decision making is absolute. It results from the limits of an 18th century philosophy and philosophical method. Simply, current methods of examining these issues can not resolve them because the method itself is limited.</p>
<p>Answers are possible. They require, Koch argues, a new approach. In it, principle is the goal, not the mechanism of solution. Its parts must be defined and their application considered in context. This is demonstrated using two distinct contemporary problems. The first: Who gets available organ transplants? How do we decide between the equally needy when there are not enough organs for all? The second: The problem of Baby K, the care or non-care of brain stem, anencephalic babies. These problems are defined using multicriterion approach and resolved through a series of focus group discussions that involve medical and lay personnel. What results is a new, more inclusive view of medicine and a new, more complex understanding of what consensus may mean in an evolving, twenty-first century society. This is must reading for lay people, medical personal, and policymakers concerned with bioethics and medical philosophy issues.</p>

"Salvador Dalí: The Construction Of The Image, 1925-1930",['Fèlix Fanés'],"<p>As a very young artist in training at the academy in Madrid, Salvador Dalí worked in two distinct modes—a highly detailed naturalism (under the influence of the “return to order”) and a more avant-garde, cubist-derived style that owed much to Picasso (whom Dalí visited in Paris in 1926). Then, in 1927, the twenty-three-year-old artist, influenced by André Breton’s <i>Surrealist Manifesto</i> of 1924 and the paintings of such artists as Joan Miró and Yves Tanguy, began to move towards Surrealism. In the spring of 1929, to coincide with the shooting of Buñuel’s <i>Un Chien andalou</i>, Dalí organized his first Paris exhibition, thereby gaining acclaim as a full member of the surrealist movement.<br>
This book offers a wealth of new material about Dalí’s formative years as a young artist in Spain and first years in Paris. Fèlix Fanés, one of the most knowledgeable Dalí scholars in the world, transforms perceptions of the artist and shows how the stage was set for the emergence of Dalí’s mature artistic personality. With a fresh and detailed assessment of Dalí’s truly revolutionary work, Fanés reveals the central role of the artist not only in the development of the Surrealist movement but also the course of 20th-century art.</p>"

Trust And Risk In Internet Commerce,['L. Jean Camp'],"<p>As Internet-based commerce becomes commonplace, it is important that we examine the systems used for these financial transactions. Underlying each system is a set of assumptions,particularly about trust and risk. To evaluate systems, and thus to determine one's own risks,requires an understanding of the dimensions of trust: security, privacy, and reliability.In this book Jean Camp focuses on two major yet frequently overlooked issues in the design of Internet commerce systems—trust and risk. Trust and risk are closely linked. The level of risk can be determined by looking at who trusts whom in Internet commerce transactions. Who will pay, in terms of money and data, if trust is misplaced? When the inevitable early failures occur, who will be at risk? Who is ""liable"" when there is a trusted third party? Why is it necessary to trust this party? What exactly is this party trusted to do? To answer such questions requires an understanding of security, record-keeping, privacy, and reliability.The author's goal is twofold: first, to provide information on trust and risk to businesses that are developing electronic commerce systems; and second, to help consumers understand the risks in using the Internet for purchases and show them how to protect themselves. Rather than propose a single model of an Internet commerce system, the author provides the information and insights needed by merchants and consumers as they develop the Internet for commerce.</p>"
Public Access Television: America's Electronic Soapbox,['Laura Linder'],"<p>As Laura Linder asserts, increased concentration of media ownership has resulted in the homogenization of public discourse. Packaged, commercialized messages have replaced the personalized and localized opinions necessary for the uninhibited marketplace of ideas envisioned in the First Amendment. Narrowcast outlets such as talk radio give vent to individual voices, but only to a limited, predefined audience. The media have led a social shift toward splintering and compartmentalization, away from pluralism and consensus.</p>
<p>Public access television provides an alternative to this trend, requiring active public participation in the process of developing community-based programming through the dominant medium of television. Today, more than 2,000 public access television centers exist in the United States, producing more than 10,000 hours of original, local programming every week. But public access television remains underutilized, even as deregulation and growing interest in other telecommunications delivery systems pose a potential threat to the long-term viability of public access television. In this comprehensive review of the background and development of public access television, Linder offers all the information needed to understand the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings as well as the nuts and bolts of public access television in the United States. Must reading for students and scholars involved with mass media in the United States and professionals in the television field.</p>"
Becoming John Dewey: Dilemmas Of A Philosopher And Naturalist,['Thomas Dalton'],"<p>As one of America’s ""public intellectuals,"" John Dewey was engaged in a lifelong struggle to understand the human mind and the nature of human inquiry. According to Thomas C. Dalton, the successful pursuit of this mission demanded that Dewey become more than just a philosopher; it compelled him to become thoroughly familiar with the theories and methods of physics, psychology, and neurosciences, as well as become engaged in educational and social reform. Tapping archival sources and Dewey’s extensive correspondence, Dalton reveals that Dewey had close personal and intellectual ties to scientists and scholars who helped form the mature expression of his thought. Dewey’s relationships with F. M. Alexander, Henri Matisse, Niels Bohr, Myrtle McGraw, and Lawrence K. Frank, among others, show how Dewey dispersed pragmatism throughout American thought and culture.</p>"
"The Painted Photograph, 1839-1914: Origins, Techniques, Aspirations","['Heinz  K. Henisch', 'Bridget Ann Henisch']","<p>As photography grew more popular following its invention in 1839, its admirers did not understand how a medium that rendered shapes and textures in exquisite detail could fail to render them in realistic color. Also disappointing was the tendency of the captured images to fade over time. Photographers, ever eager to please their public, began ""painting"" their photographs with substances ranging from water colors and oil to chalk and crayon. Images were enlarged, enhanced, and framed, to simulate the splendors of the traditional portrait.</p>
<p>With its rich variety of illustrations in color and duotone, <em>The Painted Photograph</em> is the first comprehensive history of overpainting, from its origins to World War I. The 131 illustrations featured draw upon original nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sources, most from America and Britain, but also representing Japan, Turkey, Austria, Germany, Poland, Canada, Bohemia, India, Australia, Norway, Holland, and Russia.</p>
<p>In describing a multitude of early techniques, the authors survey overpainting on various types of photographs, including daguerreotypes, tintypes, and imprinted porcelain, milk glass, enamel, magic lantern slides, and textiles. Particularly fascinating are discussions of overpainted death portraits, most commonly those of children, and the origins of popular ""picture postcards"" featuring overpainted landscape scenes. The Henisches address also the eager acceptance of the painted photograph throughout the world, despite the hostility of the art-critical establishment.</p>
<p><em>The Painted Photograph</em> will appeal to a wide public interested in photography, history, sociology, social anthropology, folk art, popular fashion, and antiques.</p>"
Endings And Beginnings,['Larry I. Palmer'],"<p>As society struggles to cope with the many repercussions of assisted life and death, the evening news is filled with stories of legal battles over frozen embryos and the possible prosecution of doctors for their patients' suicide. Using an institutional approach as an alternative to the prevailing rights based analysis of problems in law and medicine, this study explains why society should resist the tendency to look to science and law for a resolution of intimate matters, such as how our children are born and how we die. Palmer's institutional approach demonstrates that legislative analysis is often more important than judicial analysis when it comes to issues raised by new reproductive technologies and physician-assisted suicide. A reliance on individual rights alone for answers to the complex ethical questions that result from society's faith in scientific progress and science's close alliance with medicine will be insufficient and ill-advised.</p><p>Palmer predicts that the key role of the family as a societal institution will mean that questions of assisted reproduction will be resolved more in response to market forces than through legal intervention. However, he does support a strong role for legislatures in decisions involving the physicians' role in our deaths. These findings are based on the differing views of the Supreme Court justices in these matters: a tendency to protect family formation from state interference (as in abortion decisions), but support of a legislative obligation to control medicine (assisted suicide). According to Palmer, recent Supreme Court decisions on physician assisted suicide usher in a new era in how legal institutions will resolve biomedical dilemmas.</p>"
Nirvana: The Biography,['Everett True'],"<p>As the assistant editor of <i>Melody Maker</i>, Everett True was the first journalist to cover the Seattle music scene in early 1989 and interview Nirvana. He is responsible for bringing Hole, Pavement, Soundgarden, and a host of other bands to international attention. He introduced Kurt Cobain to Courtney Love, performed on stage with Nirvana on numerous occasions, and famously pushed Kurt onto the stage of the Reading Festival in 1992 in a wheelchair. <i>Nirvana: The Biography</i> is an honest, moving, incisive, and heartfelt re-evaluation of a band that has been misrepresented time and time again since its tragic demise in April 1994 following Kurt Cobain’s suicide. True captures what the band was really like. He also discusses the music scene of the time-the fellow bands, the scenes, the seminars, the countless live dates, the friends and allies and drug dealers. Drawn from hundreds of original interviews, <i>Nirvana: The Biography</i> is the final word on Nirvana, Cobain, and Seattle grunge.</p>"
"Millennium Rage: Survivalists, White Supremacists, And The Doomsday Prophecy",['P. Lamy'],"<p>As the millennium approaches, apocalyptic fervor is sweeping the nation. Militias, white supremacists, survivalists, and cults have seized upon the Book of Revelation to trumpet their own fractured version of the end of the world. Millennium Rage is the only book that connects the strands of these fringe groups to a tradition that has underpinnings in American culture and mainstream religion. It moreover shows that many of these groups have stolen and twisted apocalyptic religious symbols to fit their own end: gearing up for Armageddon in this world, not the next. The Oklahoma bombers, the Sons of Gestapo, the Branch Davidians, and the Unabomber are, as Philip Lamy astutely demonstrates, extreme examples of burgeoning strains within society. ""Ruby Ridge"" and ""Waco"" have become rallying cries of a growing number of average Americans who feel disenfranchised and forgotten. Members of militia movements and white supremacists, whom Lamy interviewed for this book, have tapped into their reservoir of discontent and are channeling it for their own aims. As Lamy points out, rugged individualists and utopian groups have always dotted the American landscape. What is alarming, however, is the misuse of the Christian apocalypse to promote a religion that fans the flames of hate, preaching the destruction of minorities - including Jews, blacks, and immigrants - in a whirlwind showdown. Lamy asserts that this new religion, ""Christian Identity,"" serves as a unifying factor among an array of extremist groups who call for a battle here on earth against Satan's supposed forces - minorities allegedly bent on a worldwide conspiracy to rule the world. Distorting the Bible and other literature through a prism of hate and fear, they have made some inroads into the consciousness of America, according to Lamy.</p>"

Securing America's Future: National Strategy In The Information Age (praeger Security International),['Daniel M. Gerstein'],"<p>As the world moves further into the Information Age and the ensuing increased levels of globalization, the ability to harness all of the elements of national power in an integrated, coordinated, and synchronized manner will be even more critical for the United States to successfully defend itself. Gerstein argues that the United States as a nation is largely unprepared to reap the full benefits of the Information Age and unable to address an increasing threat level because its methods, procedures, and ways of thinking remain anchored to the Industrial Age that is rapidly being left behind. To understand and adapt to this emerging environment, the United States must re-examine the development and the implementation of national security strategy.</p>
<p>Gerstein examines the history of U.S. national security strategy, and he analyzes the results and conclusions of several capstone documents, including the National Security Strategy of the United States (2002), the Homeland Security Strategy of the United States (2002), the Commission of National Security/21st Century, and the 9/11 Commission Report. After evaluating the execution of U.S. national security strategy, Gerstein maintains that U.S. efforts today are more heavily weighted to the use of hard power—political, military, and intelligence resources—for achieving strategic goals and objectives. A strategy that incorporates more fully the elements of national power, including soft power such as economic, social, cultural, and informational capabilities will better serve the interests of the nation. In addition, Gerstein proposes a new way of looking at strategy. Typically, strategy has been defined as the linking of ways and means to achieve ends while mitigating risk. In the future, we must factor environment into any discussion.</p>"
"Other Leaders, Other Heroes: West Point's Legacy To America Beyond The Field Of Battle (history; 60)",['James R. Endler'],"<p>As West Point celebrates its bicentennial, this study provides examples of significant non-combat contributions made by Military Academy graduates to the development and growth of the United States. It includes a sampling of the accomplishments of the military academy's doctors, clergy, builders, and educators, and tells the story of the statesmen, engineers, industrialists and financiers, artists, and writers who all began their careers at the Military Academy. Their success prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to remark at the centennial celebration that no other educational institution in the land has contributed as many names as West Point has contributed to the honor roll of the nation's citizens. After two hundred years, West Point continues to provide the nation with men, as well as women, of character, trained to undertake the leadership and direction of large enterprises, both in war and peace.</p>
<p>Civilian universities produce graduates who are particularly skilled in their primary subject of academic study. At West Point, that primary subject is leadership. West Point graduates were instrumental in the exploration and mapping of unknown territory west of the Mississippi, as well as the unknown reaches of space. They have been elected or appointed to serve at every level of federal, state, and local government, from the office of the president to local boards of education. Graduates of West Point, the sole engineering institution in the nation until 1824, were selected to head the new engineering schools established at some of the nation's most prestigious universities, including Yale and Harvard. Readers will be surprised at the wide range of contributions that Academy graduates have made in our nation's history.</p>"
"Youth, Identity, And Digital Media",['David Buckingham'],"<p>As young people today grow up in a world saturated with digital media, how does it affect their sense of self and others? As they define and redefine their identities through engagements with technology, what are the implications for their experiences as learners, citizens,consumers, and family and community members? This addresses the consequences of digital media use for young people's individual and social identities. The contributors explore how young people use digital media to share ideas and creativity and to participate in networks that are small and large,local and global, intimate and anonymous. They look at the emergence of new genres and forms, from SMS and instant messaging to home pages, blogs, and social networking sites. They discuss such topics as ""girl power"" online, the generational digital divide, young people and mobile communication, and the appeal of the ""digital publics"" of MySpace, considering whether these media offer young people genuinely new forms of engagement, interaction, and communication.ContributorsAngela Booker, danah boyd, Kirsten Drotner, Shelley Goldman, Susan C.</p>

Between Sodom And Eden: A Gay Journey Through Today's Changing Israel,['Lee Walzer'],"<p>Astonishingly, Israeli lesbians and gays have been able to achieve many political goals that still elude America's gay community. Israel's Supreme Court has mandated same-sex spousal benefits; the military, which never barred gays to begin with, has removed its last official restrictions; Israel's parliament boasts a Subcommittee for the Prevention of Sexual Orientation Discrimination; and school curricula are gay-friendly -- all of this in a country where religious interests wield extraordinary power and whose identity today is the object of fierce struggle.</p>
<p><i>Between Sodom and Eden,</i> the first book to explore this rapidly changing landscape, is based on interviews with over one hundred Israelis, as well as Palestinians. Lee Walzer explores how, within a decade, Israel has evolved from a society that marginalized homosexuals to one that offers some of the most extensive legal protections in the world. He traces the political, religious, and social factors that make Israel a gay rights trendsetter, examining the interplay between Judaism and homosexuality, the growing prominence of gay themes in Israeli literature, film, music, and television, and the role of the media in advancing lesbian and gay political progress.</p>

The Temple Bombing,['Melissa Fay Greene'],"<p>At 3:37 in the morning of Sunday, October 12, 1958, a bundle of dynamite blew out the side wall of the Temple, Atlanta's oldest and richest synagogue. The devastation to the building was vast-but even greater were the changes those 50 sticks of dynamite made to Atlanta, the South, and ultimately, all of the United States (<i>Detroit Free Press</i>). Finalist for the National Book Award, <i>The Temple Bombing</i> is the brilliant and moving examination of one town that came together in the face of hatred, a book that rescues a slice of the civil rights era whose lessons still resonate nearly fifty years after that fateful fall day.</p>


                        <p>On October 12, 1958, the Reform Jewish synagogue in Atlanta exploded when 50 sticks of dynamite detonated--a key moment in Civil Rights history, as vivid and telling in its way as Rosa Park's refusal to change bus seats. Now, the National Book Award-winning author of Praying for Sheetrock looks back on this pivotal event, creating an extraordinary picture of a city, a region, and indeed a country on the cusp of monumental change.

Walking Tours Of Boston's Made Land,"['Seasholes, Nancy S.']","<p>At its founding, Boston was a small peninsula; over the last 375 years the city has doubled in size by filling in the surrounding tidal flats—areas covered with water at high tide and exposed at low. In Walking Tours of Boston's Made Land, historian Nancy Seasholes outlines twelve walks that trace where and why Boston's man-made land was created, and, along the way, uncovers fascinating and little-known pieces of Boston history. In the course of these walks—around the central waterfront, Back Bay, Beacon Hill, the South End, Charlestown, and elsewhere—she shows us how Boston's past is always just below the surface of its present.Each walk is accompanied by a map that shows the route and original shoreline.

Painted In Words: A Memoir,['Samuel S Bak'],"<p>At my first sight of a painting by Samuel Bak, I had the keen sense that he was telling me stories with his brush. Now that at long last he has written this book, I find it no wonder that he has painted with his pen.... Among the tens and hundreds of books I have read about the pre-Shoah and post-Shoah period... Bak’s book is unique. Despite being suffused with a sense of loss, horror, degradation, and death, it is ultimately a sanguine, funny book, full of the love of life, rocking with an almost cathartic joy. At times I found myself bursting out laughing... a marvelous ode, a colorful hymn to the forces of life, love, creation, and the joys of the senses. —From the Foreword by Amos Oz</p>
<p>In Painted in Words internationally renowned artist Samuel Bak sets aside his brushes to narrate the stories of his life—as a child in Nazi-occupied Vilna, as a youth in European refugee camps, and as a maturing artist in Israel, France, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States. With gentle humor, the child prodigy of the faraway past and the accomplished artist of today engage in a spirited dialogue from which emerges a self-portrait of ""The Artist as a Young—and middle-aged and aging—Survivor."" The brilliance, vision, and virtuosity that Bak brings to his painting are equally in evidence in his writing. This deeply touching work is an important contribution to Holocaust literature and art history.</p>"
"The Conquest of Malaria: Italy, 1900-1962",['Frank M. Snowden'],"<p>At the outset of the twentieth century, malaria was Italyâs major public health problem. It was the cause of low productivity, poverty, and economic backwardness, while it also stunted literacy, limited political participation, and undermined the army. In this book Frank Snowden recounts how Italy became the world center for the development of malariology as a medical discipline and launched the first national campaign to eradicate the disease.</p><p>Snowden traces the early advances, the setbacks of world wars and Fascist dictatorship, and the final victory against malaria after World War II. He shows how the medical and teaching professions helped educate people in their own self-defense and in the process expanded trade unionism, womenâs consciousness, and civil liberties. He also discusses the antimalarial effort under Mussoliniâs regime and reveals the shocking details of the German armyâs intentional release of malaria among Italian civilians-the first and only known example of bioterror in twentieth-century Europe. Comprehensive and enlightening, this history offers important lessons for todayâs global malaria emergency.</p>"

Azaleas: A Book of Poems,"['So-Wol Kim', 'David R.

Published in 1925, <i>Azaleas</i> is the only collection Kim Sowol (1902-1934) produced during his brief life, yet he remains one of Korea's most beloved and well-known poets. His work is a delightful and sophisticated blend of the images, tonalities, and rhythms of traditional Korean folk songs with surprisingly modern forms and themes. Sowol is also known for his unique and sometimes unsettling perspective, expressed through loneliness, longing, and a creative use of dream imagery-a reflection of Sowol's engagement with French Symbolist poetry.</p><p><i>Azaleas</i> recounts the journey of a young Korean as he travels from the northern P'yongyang area near to the cosmopolitan capital of Seoul. Told through an array of voices, the poems describe the young man's actions as he leaves home, his experiences as a student and writer in Seoul, and his return north. Although considered a landmark of Korean literature, <i>Azaleas</i> speaks to readers from all cultures. An essay by Sowol's mentor, the poet Kim Ok, concludes the collection and provides vital insight into Sowol's work and life. This elegant translation by David R.

Soft Weapons: Autobiography In Transit,['Gillian Whitlock'],"<p>Azar Nafisi’s <i>Reading Lolita in Tehran</i>, Marjane Satrapi’s comics, and “Baghdad Blogger” Salam Pax’s Internet diary are just a few examples of the new face of autobiography in an age of migration, globalization, and terror. But while autobiography and other genres of life writing can help us attend to people whose experiences are frequently unseen and unheard, life narratives can also be easily co-opted into propaganda. In <i>Soft Weapons</i>, Gillian Whitlock explores the dynamism and ubiquity of contemporary life writing about the Middle East and shows how these works have been packaged, promoted, and enlisted in Western controversies.</p>
<p>Considering recent autoethnographies of Afghan women, refugee testimony from Middle Eastern war zones, Jean Sasson’s bestsellers about the lives of Arab women, Norma Khouri’s fraudulent memoir <i>Honor Lost,</i> personal accounts by journalists reporting the war in Iraq, Satrapi’s <i>Persepolis</i>, Nafisi’s book, and Pax’s blog, Whitlock explores the contradictions and ambiguities in the rapid commodification of life memoirs.

"Barack Obama, The New Face Of American Politics (women And Minorities In Politics)","['Martin Dupuis', 'Keith Boeckelman']","<p>Barack Obama's election to the U.S. Senate in 2004 is one of the most interesting and colorful political campaigns in recent history. His rousing keynote address at the Democratic National Convention that same year made his name a household word. The Obama for Illinois crusade offers important insights into American politics. The authors explore the role of money, political party, ethnicity, religion, and the issues facing our society today. Obama's straightforward policy recommendations, message of hope and inclusion, and charismatic style propelled him to the national spotlight. Obama has the potential to shape America and to reshape U.S. politics as he campaigns for the White House.</p>
<p>Obama's state senate career and his decision to enter the U.S. Senate race are examined in this book. Despite a primary field of six competitors, Obama received more than half of the Democratic vote, defeating a multimillionaire and the state comptroller, a well-known figure in the Democratic Party. The general election imploded for the Republicans in the first few weeks of the campaign when it was revealed that their candidate was embroiled in a sex scandal. Alan Keyes, the ultraconservative, outspoken African American who had run for president twice and for the U.S. Senate from Maryland, was recruited to challenge Obama. But Obama, whose skill with the media and whose ability to raise funds was evident even in those early days of his career, easily won the race with 70 percent of the vote. The authors analyze Obama's ability to speak to the concerns of multiple constituencies by appealing to a coalition of voters that transcends race, class, and gender. At the start of his presidential run, Obama gives new meaning to the American dream.</p>"

"Alcoholic Thinking: Language, Culture, And Belief In Alcoholics Anonymous",['Danny M. Wilcox'],"<p>Based on long-term observation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the author focuses on cultural rather than personal causes of drug dependence. The author also discusses how the symbolic action of AA language and culture is the key to recovery. This study yields critical information about the development and practice of alcoholism and other drug dependence. Through the shared linguistic and cultural interaction of AA, the U.S. cultural ideology that emphasizes individualism, personal achievement, self-control, and self-reliance is shown to result in conflict; thus the gap between the perceived ideal and reality intensifies feelings of separation, alienation, and isolation leading to dependency.</p>
<p>This detailed ethnographic narrative of Alcoholics Anonymous is based on three years of participant observation. The study suggests that anyone can be victimized by alcoholic thinking. Anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, health care and professional social services organizations will be interested in this book.</p>"
Mobile Pastoralists,['Dawn Chatty'],"<p>Based on more than ten years of study among the Harasiis, a Middle Eastern tribe living in the Sultanate of Oman, <i>Mobile Pastoralists</i> is a powerful statement on the importance of grassroots, people-based development and on the inadequacy of conventional responses for such a community by the international aid bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Dawn Chatty's work is the product of years of research among the Harasiis, during which she headed an international development project aiming to provide basic social services to the tribe without disturbing their traditional nomadic pastoral way of life. <i>Mobile Pastoralists</i> provides readers with a detailed description of the conception, drafting, implementation, and completion of Chatty's aid project. The book also includes nuanced case studies of individual Harasiis men and women, showing how development efforts and the complex forces of modernization have affected members on a personal level.</p>
<p>Supplemented by a group of photographs of the tribe and their environment, along with seven detailed regional maps, <i>Mobile Pastoralists</i> is a study with valuable applications for anthropology, cultural geography, development planning, and Middle Eastern affairs.</p>

Combined Family,"['Kaufman, Taube S.']","<p>Because of the significant rates of divorce and remarriage in the United States, the stepfamily is becoming an increasingly mainstream way of life alongside the traditional nuclear family structure. When people of various age groups and backgrounds are suddenly brought together to cohabitate, specific guidelines will be necessary in order to navigate the complexities of these ""new"" relationships. The Combined Family: A Guide to Creating Successful Step-Relationships is an essential guide for understanding an individual's multiple family roles as well as the emotional and psychological nuances within step-relationships. Taube Kaufman, a clinician with expertise in stepfamily counseling, sensitively prescribes both preventative and restorative means to help alleviate the psychological stigma of living within a socially unaccepted form of family. This authoritative guide will undoubtedly help individuals to discover and prepare for the ""differences"" they can expect to encounter in moving from one family structure to another, such as: introducing a prospective new marriage partner to one's children; deciding on appropriate wedding and honeymoon plans; establishing rapport with stepchildren; coping with sibling and stepsibling rivalries; devising successful strategies to deal with former marriage partners and extended family members; arranging holiday and family celebrations; and allocating enough time and space for the newlyweds to form a strong couple bond in a family system where at least one parent and child have an emotional attachment and history that predate the marriage. A compelling series of experiences and observations by family members offered by Kaufman is indicative of her unwavering empathy for stepparents and children who inherit roles that are ambiguous, ill defined, and laced with negative connotations.</p>

Transported Styles In Shakespeare And Milton,['Harold Toliver'],"<p>Beginning with distinctions between rhetoric and poetry, Harold Toliver examines the interplay of functional speech, assigned the task of moving plots, and poetry's sublime transport to hypothetical or second worlds and their implicit criticism of the worldly possible. The dramatist who works toward a conservative reinstatement of social order is sometimes at odds with the poetic visionary. Juxtaposing Shakespeare and Milton on that matter helps situate them within their respective Elizabethan and Puritan outlooks. In ""Comus,"" with its numerous echoes of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> and <em>The Tempest</em>, Milton establishes significant differences between himself and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In developing the details of the poetry-drama tension, Toliver treats the matter of eloquence in both poetic and rhetorical excess. Othello's seeking of magnitude is half to blame for this tragedy, since it escalates the deviltry that Iago promotes. King Lear finds poetry flourishing only in helpless personal relations deprived of political authority. Failing in affairs of empire, both Antony and Cleopatra look to an alternative realm where love can proceed unhindered. <em>Winter's Tale</em> finds Shakespeare subduing such flights of imagination on behalf of a restored dynastic order, bringing Bohemia to Sicilia, but <em>The Tempest</em> poses the most radical separation of his usual two worlds, forcing Prospero to abandon the one he prefers. Milton's attempt to show providence applied to a nationalistic action in <em>Samson Agonistes</em> also requires freedom from normal ethical and social considerations if the Israelites are to accept their highly destructive hero as a go-between, in his enigmatic instrumentality as God's athlete.</p>
<p>For both Milton and Shakespeare, the more transported the language, the less it can be applied to a normal social cohesion. In both, the dramatist and the bard find at best an uneasy truce.</p>"
The Papacy,['Bernhard Schimmelpfennig'],"<p>Bernhard Schimmelpfennig chronicles the institution of the papacy and its influence on the culture, politics, and economy throughout the decline of the Roman emparie, Byzantine rule, and the Middle Ages in his book, <i>The Papacy</i>. The full spectrum of the institutional Medieval Church is examined as Schimmelpfennig presents its evolution through liturgical, political, artistic, cultural, and economic developments, as well as social changes that occurred under the papacy's influence such as a revamping of marriage laws, housing construction, and food distribution.</p>

Jewish Settler Violence: Deviance As Social Reaction,"['Weisburd, David.']","<p>Between 1949 and 1967 few Israelis had questioned the boundaries established during Israel's war for independence. Zionist and religious ideologies that advocated Jewish control over all the ""Land of Israel""—the areas of Jewish settlement in biblical times—lay dormant. The 1967 victory, which brought the bulk of these territories under Israeli control, rekindled traditional sentiments for the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty in all these territories. These sentiments became a powerful political force within Israel and provide a growing potential for violence. This book examines those Israelis who have become most identified with this violence. Its focus is upon the development of vigilantism and political deviance in the Gush Emunim settlements.</p>
<p>This book examines the similarities between deviant behavior and society's reactions to deviance. It examines the deviance of Jewish settlers who themselves advocate or participate in law-violating actions. It describes and explains the social organization of deviant social controls. Rather than centering our view of the normative process in the general society, it focuses upon Jewish settlers who evade and resist the rules and laws of that society in the name of ""higher"" laws.</p>
<p>A detailed examination of settler rationalizations of vigilante violence against Arabs provides an unusual glimpse of community support for law violations in these areas. Unique quantitative data allow for the first major multivariate analysis of vigilante attitudes and behaviors.</p>
<p><em>Jewish Settler Violence</em> provides an innovative and thought-provoking approach to violence that is rationalized and legitimized with reference to norms and values. It illustrates the importance of broadening concerns with crime and deviance to include ""altruistic"" law violations that have more in common with the complex decision-making processes of societal reactions than the routine character of most deviant behavior. It also provides a set of sobering implications for the future of Jewish settler violence. This research suggests that vigilantism and antigovernment violence will increase at the same time that the Israeli government will find it increasingly difficulty to respond to and control settler deviance.</p>"
The Last Years Of The Soviet Empire: Snapshots From 1985-1991,"[""Neil F. O'donnell""]","<p>Between 1985 and 1991, the Soviet Union was shaken to its core by a series of remarkable social and political developments. Throughout the period, the eminent Sovietologist Vladimir Shlapentokh monitored the revolution and recorded his impressions in a series of essays which were published in major North American newspapers and periodicals. Here Shlapentokh collects these snapshots of current events that detail the progression of perestroika and glasnost. The essays and accompanying narrative form a kind of political diary, reflecting not only the facts of history, but the author's perspective as a Soviet/Western observer.</p>
<p>Each chapter focuses on a single year. The snapshots from that year are woven together with narrative describing the year's most important milestones, including events in Moscow, results of new polls, new social trends, and revelations in the Soviet mass media. Surprisingly, Shlapentokh concludes that perestroika was not inevitable, and that the Soviet Union was not, as many scholars assert, doomed to collapse. The author's unusual perspective is preserved throughout the book, since none of the essays, including those that predicted future events, have been altered to more closely approximate events that actually took place. Recommended for scholars of sociology, political science, and Soviet history.</p>"
Miles Davis: The Early Years,['Bill Cole'],"<p>Bill Cole's study of the music of Miles Davis covers his career from his first meeting with Charlie Parker up to his experimentation with electric music in the early 1970s. Cole sheds new light not only on Miles Davis's technique, recordings, and philosophy, but on those of his fellow musicians as well: Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown, Bill Evans, Gerry Mulligan, and Charles Mingus, among others. Supplemented with thirteen musical transcriptions of his solos and a complete list of his recording sessions through 1972, <i>Miles Davis: The Early Years</i> illuminates much more than the life and work of one of jazz's most innovative musicians: It explores the very nature of African American music itself.</p>"
Bioethics In The Age Of New Media (the Mit Press),['Joanna Zylinska'],"<p>Bioethical dilemmas—including those over genetic screening, compulsory vaccination,and abortion—have been the subject of ongoing debates in the media, among the public, and in professional and academic communities. But the paramount bioethical issue in an age of digital technology and new media, Joanna Zylinska argues, is the transformation of the very notion of life.</p>
<p>In this provocative book, Zylinska examines many of the ethical challenges that technology poses to the allegedly sacrosanct idea of the human. In doing so, she goes beyond the traditional understanding of bioethics as a matter for moral philosophy and medicine to propose a new""ethics of life"" rooted in the relationship between the human and the nonhuman (both animals and machines) that new technology prompts us to develop. After a detailed discussion of the classical theoretical perspectives on bioethics, Zylinska describes three cases of ""bioethics in action,"" through which the concepts of ""the human,"" ""animal,"" and""life"" are being redefined: the reconfiguration of bodily identity by plastic surgery in a TV makeover show; the reduction of the body to two-dimensional genetic code; and the use of biological material in such examples of ""bioart"" as Eduardo Kac's infamous fluorescent green bunny. Zylinska addresses ethics from the interdisciplinary perspective of media and cultural studies, drawing on the writings of thinkers from Agamben and Foucault to Haraway and Hayles. Taking theoretical inspiration in particular from the philosophy of alterity as developed by Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, and Bernard Stiegler, Zylinska makes the case for a new nonsystemic,nonhierarchical bioethics that encompasses the kinship of humans, animals, and machines.</p>"
Alfred Kazin: A Biography,"['Cook, Richard M. , 1941-']","<p>Born in 1915 to barely literate Jewish immigrants in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, Alfred Kazin rose from near poverty to become a dominant figure in twentieth-century literary criticism and one of America’s last great men of letters. Biographer Richard M. Cook provides a portrait of Kazin in his public roles and in his frequently unhappy private life. Drawing on the personal journals Kazin kept for over 60 years, private correspondence, and numerous conversations with Kazin, he uncovers the full story of the lonely, stuttering boy from Jewish Brownsville who became a pioneering critic and influential cultural commentator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon the appearance of <i>On Native Grounds</i> in 1942, Kazin was dubbed ""the boy wonder of American criticism.” Numerous publications followed, including <i>A Walker in the City</i> and two other memoirs, books of criticism, as well as a stream of essays and reviews that ceased only with his death in 1998. Cook tells of Kazin’s childhood, his troubled marriages, and his relations with such figures as Lionel Trilling, Saul Bellow, Malcolm Cowley, Arthur Schlesinger, Hannah Arendt, and Daniel Bell. He illuminates Kazin’s thinking on political-cultural issues and the recurring way in which his subject’s personal life shaped his career as a public intellectual. Particular attention is paid to Kazin’s sense of himself as a Jewish-American ""loner” whose inner estrangements gave him insight into the divisions at the heart of modern culture.</p>

Boxer: An Anthology Of Writings On Boxing And Visual Culture,"['Chandler, David', 'Institute Of International Visual Arts', 'Walsall Museum And Art Gallery']","<p>Boxing has always provoked passionate responses, attracting committed followers and outspoken critics in all sections of society. Objections to the spectacle of legal violence has been tempered by those who admire and are drawn to boxing as a supremely disciplined activity, who see it as a science or an art. But many still revile it as a decadent sport. It is these tensions, between sport and art, aesthetics and perversion, that have shaped boxing 's rich history and forged its special links with the art world over three decades.The ten essays and duotone illustrations in Boxer provide a multifaceted look at perceptions of the sport, embracing issues of masculinity,class, eroticism, and race. Contributors (most of whose work was commissioned especially for this volume) include Joyce Carol Oates, Marcia Pointon, Sarah Hyde, Ian Jeffrey, David Alan Mellor, Jean Fisher, Keith Piper, Nick James, Jennifer Hargreaves, and Roger Conover. Their essays examine boxing in a wide variety of contexts — high art and popular culture, painting and sculpture, photography,film, and television — yet they all see boxing and the visual arts as having a unique relationship that crosses and confuses social and artistic hierarchies.Distributed for the Institute of International Visual Arts, London</p>"
Gender And Boyle's Law Of Gases:,['Elizabeth Potter'],"<p>Boyle’s Law, which describes the relation between the pressure and volume of a gas, was worked out by Robert Boyle in the mid-1600s. His experiments are still considered examples of good scientific work and continue to be studied along with their historical and intellectual contexts by philosophers, historians, and sociologists. Now there is controversy over whether Boyle’s work was based only on experimental evidence or whether it was influenced by the politics and religious controversies of the time, including especially class and gender politics.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Potter argues that even good science is sometimes influenced by such issues, and she shows that the work leading to the Gas Law, while certainly based on physical evidence, was also shaped by class and gendered considerations. At issue were two descriptions of nature, each supporting radically different visions of class and gender arrangements. Boyle’s Law rested on mechanistic principles, but Potter shows us an alternative law based on hylozooic principles (the belief that all matter is animated), whose adherents challenged social stability and the status quo in 17th-century England.</p>"
Brazil: Politics In A Patrimonial Society,"['Roett, Riordan , 1938-']","<p>Brazil, occupying nearly 50 percent of the South American continent, has the largest economy and is a major political power in Latin America. In this updated and expanded fifth edition of his text, Roett provides a thorough introduction to the dynamics shaping Brazilian politics, economics, and society, the difficult transition from military to civilian government in the 1980s, and the social issues facing Brazilian leaders as the country enters the 21st century. As Roett makes clear, despite years of economic growth and industrialization, by the late 1990s, Brazil still faces continued and growing challenges to its social cohesiveness and stability. Without greater attention to the basic needs of the Brazilian poor, the fabric of democracy in the New Republic faces formidable challenges.

"The Essential Daughter: Changing Expectations For Girls At Home, 1797 To Present","['Collins, Mary , 1961-']","<p>By age nine, Mary Ellen could start a fire and make breakfast for her family on the Great Plains as they traveled West. By age 11, Connie's family had her hanging the laundry and doing the dishes for a dozen people. By age 13, Beverly had no responsibilities at home and no confidence in herself. The portraits of 14 girls aged 6 to 14, when their ideas of duty and self remained in flux, are used as a starting point for discussion on how to bring daughters and their brothers back into the flow of American home life. The author explores how Americans might make girls feel essential on the home front without denying them the right of self-definition.</p>
<p>Few American parents expect their children to play an important role on the home front. The average daughter does fewer than ten hours of housework a week; sons do only two. What are the consequences of this dramatic cultural shift? Collins posits that nothing we can give our children in the public sphere can offset the loss. Collins concludes that Americans must rebuild a domestic culture that moves beyond the damaging sex-based division of labor so common in the past.</p>"
Validity In Interpretation,['E.d. Hirsch'],"<p>By demonstrating the uniformity and universality of the principles of valid interpretation of verbal texts of any sort, this closely reasoned examination provides a theoretical foundation for a discipline that is fundamental to virtually all humanistic studies. It defines the grounds on which textual interpretation can claim to establish objective knowledge, defends that claim against such skeptical attitudes as historicism and psychologism, and shows that many confusions can be avoided if the distinctions between meaning and significance, interpretation and criticism are correctly understood. It provides perhaps the first genuinely comprehensive account of hermeneutic theory to appear in English and the first systematic presentation of the principles of valid interpretation in any language.</p>
<p>Mr. Hirsch, associate professor of English at the University of Virginia, is the author of <i>Wordsworth and Schelling</i> and <i>Innocence and Experience: An Introduction to Blake.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Here is a book that brings logic to the most unruly of disciplines, literary interpretation. Viewing this subject within the tradition of hermeneutics, Mr. Hirsch is able to trace its origins and development with brilliant insight. &nbsp;The result is a lucidly systemic and authoritative account of the premises and procedures applicable to the interpretation of a literary text.&nbsp; Mr. Hirsch has performed a monumental service thereby that of reinstating the credentials of objectivism and defining the limits of the aesthetics of truth. &nbsp;This study is a necessary took for anyone who wants to talk sense about literature.”—<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i><br>
“Professor Hirsch demonstrates convincingly that objectivity is attainable in humane studies, and that it is not identified with the subject but with the evidence. A valid interpretation is not necessarily a correct one, but one which is more probably than any other on the basis of existing evidence.&nbsp; He makes a subtle and important distinction between a text’s ‘meaning’ (which does not change) and its ‘significance’ (which does), and brilliantly relates meaning to understanding (the necessary preliminary to interpretation) and interpretation to explanation…” In short, this is a work which future students of literary theory cannot afford to neglect.”—<i>Notes and Queries</i><br>

Camille Pissarro: impressions of city & country,"['Levitov, Karen.']","<p>Camille Pissarro (18301903) was a ceaseless innovator and organizer whose ideological concerns were as profound as his aesthetic interests. <i>Camille Pissarro: Impressions of City and Country</i> examines how Pissarro's artistic theories and social convictions influenced his Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pissarro espoused an anti-bourgeois, anarchist ideology and was interested in the plight of the working classes. This book’s authors examine recurring motifs in Pissarro’s work as intellectual metaphors as well as his background as a Sephardic Jew who was involved in many of the political and class issues of the period. The text also looks at Pissarro as a painter who identified with laborers and agriculture, exploring connections between his subject matter and the ""dirty” nature of his painterly technique.</p>
<p>Featuring a wide selection of superb paintings from private collections, many rarely seen, this beautifully illustrated book reveals the genius of an artist keenly focused on his natural surroundings and the lives of common folk.</p>"
Hamlet's Mother And Other Women,['Carolyn Heilbrun'],"<p>Carolyn G. Heilbrun's groundbreaking essay ""The Character of Hamlet's Mother"" was published in 1957 at a time when few critics thought seriously about women's issues in literature. In the years since, Heilbrun has emerged as a feminist leader through her commitment to women's writing and feminist literary critique. Now in a new paperback edition with a new preface by the author, this collection explores feminism in literary studies during the last three decades. By questioning the gender arrangements of society, Heilbrun has helped to transform them. Taken together, these graceful essays demonstrate the consistency and clarity of Heilbrun's vision and her deep respect for the lives of women who write.</p>

"Cecil And Ida Green, Philanthropists Extraordinary (mit Press)",['Robert R. Shrock'],"<p>Cecil and Ida Green made a fortune almost by chance. In 1941 they bought a quarter share of a faltering oil exploration company; government contracts during the war led to the creation of a small instrumentation division that became Texas Instruments. In 1954 scientists at Texas Instruments created the first silicon transistor, and the rest is history. What is remarkable about the Greens, however, was their joint decision to share the fruits of their success as widely as possible. Their donations of more than $150 million have left an indelible mark on American scientific and medical education. This warm, anecdotal biography by the Greens' longtime friend, MIT geologist Robert Shrock reveals the human impulses that led to their success, the unique combination of the analytical and the personal that they brought to their business decisions and to their investments in humanity's future. Shrock describes the early years of the Greens' life together in and around Texas, exploring for subsurface structures possibly containing oil and gas: fifteen years of hard field work followed by ten years as geophysical entrepreneurs. He follows the transformation of their first acquisition, a risky geophysical venture, into the wildly successful Texas Instruments. Their fortune made, Shrock details the decades in which the Greens imaginatively shared their wealth - funding academic buildings, hospitals, health care centers, libraries and other civic buildings; endowing professorships, fellowships, and scholarships in ten different schools and research institutions; assisting in founding two new colleges - at the University of Texas at Dallas and at Oxford - and an innovative educational audio-visual TV network in Dallas. In choosing their grantees, Shrock notes, they applied exactly those analytical skills that had paid off in business decisions: the Greens could be as hard-nosed in dealing with the cost-benefit aspects of redistributing wealth as in amassing it. At the same time their approach was always intensely personal and direct.</p>"

Challenging the civil rights establishment,"['Joseph G. Conti', 'Brad Stetson']","<p>Challenging the Civil Rights Establishment is a compelling introduction to the ideas of black social critics who oppose the most prominent voices of black America's leadership. In their analysis of the vanguard, which provokes the ire of the civil rights establishment, J.G. Conti and Brad Stetson focus on four men: Thomas Sowell, a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution who targets Marxism, the knowledge class, and entitlement programs; Shelby Steele, author of <i>The Content of Our Character</i>, who discusses the experience of American blacks from an existentialist viewpoint; Robert Woodson, founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the best known advocate of interior activism; and Glenn Loury, a conservative political economist at Boston University whose primary theme is the distinction he makes between the enemy without (racism), and the enemy within (dysfunctional behavior that perpetuates poverty and dependency). In speeches, in their writings, and in interviews with Conti and Stetson, these thinkers discuss how the construction of public policy has devolved into a kind of ethnic cheerleading that exalts race and ethnicity above personal character and behaviors in determinations of what is fair.</p><p>The spectrum of these critics' opinions includes neoconservative, libertarian, populist, and democratic social thought, but Conti and Stetson have identified commonalities that structure their discussion: members of the black vanguard reject the notion that racial faithfulness requires ideological homogeneity; they argue that a chilling silence has been spread around a ghetto-specific culture of poverty by black advocates who fear that such discussions will play into the hands of enemies of the black community; they maintain that racism is not a sufficient cause for black poverty and other social problems experienced by blacks; and they object on moral and pragmatic grounds the civil rights leadership's reliance on the political capital of white guilt. De-emphasizing racism as a generator of poverty, they explain the proliferation of the black underclass in other ways, including structural changes in urban economies and welfare work disincentives. In Challenging the Civil Rights Establishment, Conti and Stetson break through the ideological pretension that has overrun clear thinking and the empirical data of human experience in discussions of race and culture.</p>"
Survival Of The African American Family: The Institutional Impact Of U.s. Social Policy,['Karen S. Jewell'],"<p>Challenging widely held beliefs, this provocative book offers nothing less than a blueprint for enhancing the social and economic status of African American families. Despite the implementation of liberal social policies in the 1960s and '70s, successive U.S. administrations continue to dash the hopes and expectations of African Americans, who remain subject to racism and discrimination. Arguing that social policies—and their absence—have affected the stability of the African American family, Jewell refutes the myth of significant progress for African American families emanating from the civil rights era, exposing the myriad reasons why greater advancement toward equality has not occurred in major societal institutions. Attention is focused on the extent to which African American families have been adversely affected by a process of assimilation that was socio-psychological rather than economic. This new edition builds upon the first edition, and is revised and expanded to reflect new and persistent institutional policies and practices of race, gender and class inequality facing African American families. The revised edition explores such issues as racial profiling, capital punishment, police brutality, predatory lending, No Child Left Behind, welfare reform, affirmative action and racial disparities in healthcare, academic achievement and home ownership. Jewell proposes a variety of strategies and policies that are needed to ensure greater social and economic equality and justice for African American families.</p>"
Changing Course: A Global Business Perspective On Development And The Environment,"['Stephan Schmidheiny', 'Business Council For Sustainable Development']","<p>Changing Course is a practical introduction to new and necessary methods of running businesses so that the realities of business and the marketplace support the realities of the environment and the needs of human development.Gathering the expertise of more than 50 leaders of multinational corporations and backed by an array of case studies showing existing best practices,Changing Course provides an extensive analysis of how the business community can adapt and contribute to the crucial goal of sustainable development - which combines the objectives of environmental protection and economic growth. All of its recommendations are linked by the belief that only by allowing market forces to operate freely and integrating the ""polluter pays"" principle into environmental and economic policy can sustainable development be achieved.Changing Course focuses first on the often adversarial relationship between business and government in chapters that discuss full-cost pricing and market signals, energy, capital markets, trade, and managing change.</p>
<p>It shows how environmental costs, which are often invisible, can best be factored into production,investment, and trade. And it calls for a rational long-term energy strategy that balances the energy needs for economic development with a policy shift toward the payment of pollution costs and energy efficiency - changes that demand new thinking and increased flexibility by policy makers in both the public and the private sectors.Changing Course then explores business to business relationships, beginning with the sensitive topic of corporate reporting in environmental areas and discussion of how an environmentally conscious firm is managed. Chapters look at optimal products and processes, product stewardship in retail and trading companies, at new practices for such renewable resource industries as forestry and agriculture, and at the need for new long-term partnerships to boost economic development and environmental standards in the developing world.Changing Course concludes with a detailed look at the implications of sustainable development for business in the developing world, where, as former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi pointed out, poverty itself is a great polluter.Stephan Schmidheiny is a Swiss industrialist, Chairman of the Business Council for Sustainable Development, and the Principal Advisor for Business and Industry to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (ECO'92).</p>"

The Great Wall Of China: Photographs By Chen Changfen (houston Museum Of Fine Arts),['Anne Wilkes Tucker'],"<p>Chen Changfen (b. 1941) began to photograph the Great Wall twenty years before the Chinese government officially adopted it as the national symbol in 1984. This fascinating book presents a small fraction of his decades-long study of the monumental form and conveys the fertile range of themes and ideas that Chen has investigated, each informed by traditional Chinese art, history, and philosophy. Combining a unique blend of traditional and contemporary technical processes, Chen’s richly evocative photographs at once celebrate the remarkable series of building campaigns that produced the Wall and memorialize the thousands of conscripted laborers whose lives were sacrificed to its construction.<br>
One of the most striking features of Chen’s photographs is their unexpected variety of perspectives and moods, capturing the vicissitudes of weather, time, and human history that have acted upon it. By excluding the people, highways, factories, and modern buildings that encroach on and daily destroy sections of the Wall, however, Chen eliminates major aspects of the Wall’s present reality from his pictures. In a thoughtful essay and interview with the artist, Anne Wilkes Tucker probes the meanings of such omissions and guides the reader through Chen’s extraordinary images. <i>The Great Wall of China</i> is essential reading for photographers, historians, and travelers.</p>"
Patterns In The Dust,['Nancy Bernkopf Tucker Ph.d.'],"<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalist government collapsed in 1949 despite United States support for the regime during the anti-Communist civil war. American policymakers were then forced to choose between rescuing the Nationalists or coming to terms with China's Communist government.</p>
<p>The Truman Administration, caught up in the calculations of cold war diplomacy, refused to make a rash decision. Secretary of State Dean Acheson likened the Nationalist collapse to a tree falling in the forest--the United States would have to wait for the dust settled before it could see ahead clearly.</p>
<p><i>Patterns in the Dust</i> is a fresh look at a period overwhelmed by later events. Drawing on many previously unavailable sources, Nancy Bernkopf Tucker assesses the factors that influenced Washington policymakers during the critical few months in which the thirty-year estrangement between the two countries began. She examines the government's assessment of the chances for accommodation with the Chinese Communists, the careful efforts to ascertain American public opinion, and the effects of the Korean War which brought reasoned dialogue to an abrupt end.</p>
<p><i>Patterns in the Dust</i> highlights the flexibility that Dean Acheson retained in American policy toward China. Acheson emerges as a highly pragmatic man determined to preserve contacts with China simply because, as events have proved, that was the realistic way to conduct international relations.</p>

In The Red: On Contemporary Chinese Culture,['Geremie Barmé'],"<p>China, Geremie R. Barmé notes, has become one of the greatest writing and publishing nations on the planet, and both cultural activists and the state are embroiled in debates about the production and distribution of its cultural products. But what happens when global culture and Chinese capitalist-socialism meet in the marketplace? <i>In the Red</i>investigates what goes on behind the rhetoric of the official Chinese government and the dissident community and provides a unique perspective on mainstream Western perceptions of cultural developments, artistic freedom, and popular lifestyles in China today.</p>
<p>Illustrated with fascinating cartoons and photographs and rich with facts, anecdotes, and events, <i>In the Red</i> exposes the complex relationship between ""official"" culture (produced, supported, or sanctioned by the government) and ""nonofficial"" or countercultures (especially among urban youths and dissidents). Two key and contrasting events loom large in this narrative: the 1989 protests that ended with the June 4 massacre and a nationwide purge, and Deng Xiaoping's 1992 ""tour of the south,"" in which he emphasized the need for radical economic reform. Although a level of political tolerance has evolved since the 1970s, Barmé sheds light on the significance of the intermittent denunciations of artists, ideas, and works.</p>"
The Rise of China,"['Michael E. Brown', 'Steven E. Miller', 'Sean M. Lynn-Jones', 'Owen R.

As its economy expanded, China seemed poised to become the second-largest economy in the world. At the same time, it modernized its military and adopted a more assertive diplomatic posture. Many observers have begun to debate the international implications of China's rise. Some analysts argue that China will inevitably pose a threat to peace and security in East Asia. A few even predict a new cold war between Beijing and Washington. Others claim that a powerful China can remain benign. None believes that China can be ignored. The essays in this volume assess China's emerging capabilities and intentions, debate the impact that China will have on security in the Asia-Pacific region, and propose polices for the United States to adopt in its relations with China.</p>"
There a Petal Silently Falls: Three Stories by Ch'oe Yun,"['Choe', 'Yun', ""Ch'oe"", 'Fulton', 'Bruce']","<p>Ch'oe Yun is a Korean author known for her breathtaking versatility, subversion of authority, and bold exploration of the inner life. Readers celebrate her creative play with fantasy and admire her deep engagement with trauma, history, and the vagaries of remembrance.</p><p>In this collection's title work, <i>There a Petal Silently Falls</i>, Ch'oe explores both the genesis and the aftershocks of historical outrages such as the Kwangju Massacre of 1980, in which a reported 2,000 civilians were killed for protesting government military rule. The novella follows the wanderings of a girl traumatized by her mother's murder and strikes home the injustice of state-sanctioned violence against men and especially women. Whisper Yet illuminates the harsh treatment of leftist intellectuals during the years of national division, at the same time offering the hope of reconciliation between ideological enemies. The third story, The Thirteen-Scent Flower, satirizes consumerism and academic rivalries by focusing on a young man and woman who engender an exotic flower that is coveted far and wide for its various fragrances.</p><p>Elegantly crafted and quietly moving, Ch'oe Yun's stories are among the most incisive portrayals of the psychological and spiritual reality of post-World War II Korea. Her fiction, which began to appear in the late 1980s, represents a turn toward a more experimental, deconstructionist, and postmodern Korean style of writing, and offers a new focus on the role of gender in the making of Korean history.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
City Of Friends: A Protrait Of The Gay And Lesbian Community In America,"['Simon Levay', 'Elisabeth Nonas']","<p>City of Friends offers a practical, intelligent, and well-informed overview of what it means to be gay or lesbian. The authors seek to help gay men and women, as well as their families and friends, to better understand the institutions and communities that make up the most culturally and ethnically diverse minority in America today.Beginning with basic concepts, LeVay and Nonas define the words ""homosexual,"" ""gay,"" ""lesbian,"" and ""bisexual"" and discuss the various patterns of homosexuality in different cultures around the world. They relate the history of the gay and lesbian community in the United States, and its struggle for equal rights and social acceptance, before tackling the question — still highly controversial — of what determines an individual's sexual orientation.City of Friends describes the great diversity within the gay and lesbian community: Life in the ""gay ghetto."" Old lesbians in rural hideaways. Gay resorts. A ""town without men."" Gay and lesbian Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans — what it means to be a minority within a minority. Lesbian and gay youth, the elderly, the deaf. Bisexuals and transsexuals. Academics, drag queens, technoqueers, publishers, softball players — all make their appearance in these pages.LeVay and Nonas continue with a discussion of health issues (especially of the AIDS epidemic and the community's response to it), the law, and gay and lesbian politics. They describe the cultural achievements of lesbians and gay men — their art, literature, theater, music,and dance. Finally they take a look at the spiritual life of gays and lesbians, both within and outside of organized religion.</p>

Close-up Photography,['Alan Constant'],"<p>Close-up photography is used in a variety of areas such as nature, medical and forensic, instruction and training, archiving, and the arts. The first part of the book is dedicated to the technical side of closeup work, including the equipment required, how to meter in close-up work, special problems, magnification and methods of achieving it, lighting, and electronic flash. The second part is the practical side of close-up work with an introduction to elementary composition, photographing mechanical subjects, crystals under polarized light, and nature photography. Heavily illustrated with diagrams, tables and color throughout, Close-up Photography also includes mathematical formulas that have been simplified and explained with examples.<br>
<br>
 Many photography books have some information about close-up work, but usually the subject is not treated in-depth and the variety of problems likely to come up when the photographer begins magnifying are not addressed. Most often, other books seem to deal with the use of a macro lens and ignore or gloss over other methods. This book weeds out the misinformation and the over-complication of technique to give the reader a real understanding of the field.</p>

"A President In The Family: Thomas Jefferson, Sally Hemings, And Thomas Woodson","['Woodson, Byron W.']","<p>Conceived during Thomas Jefferson's junket in Paris, Thomas Woodson was Jefferson's first child by Sally Hemings. He was banished from Monticello at the age of 12, after a journalist exposed Jefferson's relationship with his young slave. <i>A President in the Family</i> traces Thomas Woodson's subsequent journey from Virginia to Ohio where Thomas and wife Jemima, a former slave, would raise a productive and ambitious family.</p>
<p>Their eldest son Lewis, author of the famous Augustine letters, would carry on the family tradition of education, leadership, and public service. A founder of Wilberforce University and described by some as the father of black nationalism, Lewis argued that the black race should not depend on white philanthropy to achieve success in America. His children and grandchildren would prosper as entrepreneurs, engineers, and educators.</p>
<p><i>A President in the Family</i> tells of the Woodsons' continuing struggle to correct accounts by Jeffersonian historians and their successful discovery of documentation that supports an oral history that survived independently in five branches of the family tree. Byron W. Woodson, Sr., a sixth-generation descendant of Jefferson, details the recent developments in the quest to corroborate family lore, to locate missing family members, and to reveal the truth about the complex day-to-day life at Monticello. This is the amazing story of the Woodson family and its steadfast effort to reveal its illustrious past to the American public.</p>"
Conquering High Blood Pressure,"['Stephen Wood', 'Bert Griffith']","<p>Conquering High Blood Pressure: The Complete Guide to Managing Hypertension is a remarkably comprehensive account of a common chronic illness affecting adults and children. Dr. Wood, a family and occupational medicine physician, and Mr. Griffith, a family medicine physician assistant, team up to clearly address many important issues, in particular the patient's role in co-managing his or her high blood pressure with a physician or other health care attendant; the important physical or emotional concerns of special at-risk groups (e.g., the elderly, African-Americans, children, and pregnant women); the potentially hazardous side-effects or interactions of the drugs used to treat high blood pressure; the tips to follow to become a savvy consumer of medications or devices to cope with hypertension; the invaluable role of family members and friends in helping the person cope with hypertension; and the relationship between high blood pressure and other chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol).

Consciousness Reconsidered (mit Press),['Owen Flanagan'],"<p>Consciousness is neither miraculous nor ultimately mysterious. In this broad,entertaining, and persuasive account Owen Flanagan argues that we are on the way to understanding consciousness and its place in the natural order. No aspect of consciousness escapes Flanagan's probe. Qualia, self-consciousness, autobiographical memory, perceptions, sensations, the stream of consciousness, disorders such as blindsight, various kinds of amnesia, and multiple personality all find a place in a constructive theory that brings into reflective equilibrium insights from a wide array of disciplines to reveal the deep, rich, and complex hidden structure of consciousness.Flanagan roams freely through a variety of scientific and philosophical domains,showing how it is possible to understand human consciousness in a way that gives its subjective,phenomenal aspects their full due while at the same time taking into account the neural bases of subjectivity. The result is a powerful synthetic theory of consciousness, a ""constructive naturalism,"" according to which subjective consciousness is real, plays an important causal role,and resides in the brain.Flanagan draws the reader into a world of exciting current debates among such philosophers as Thomas Nagel, Daniel Dennett, Paul Churchland, Patricia Churchland, and Colin McGinn, and he makes this world accessible. He masterfully weaves the latest insights from theory and research in cognitive neuroscience, neural darwinism, connectionist brain architecture, and PET scanners to reveal clear links between events that ""seem a certain way"" and underlying neural activity. William James's famous phenomenological analysis of consciousness and neurologically impaired characters from the writings of Oliver Sacks and A. R. Luria join the narrative, providing valuable insights into important current controversies on the relation of consciousness to self.Owen Flanagan is Class of 1919 Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College.</p>"

The Right To Justification: Elements Of A Constructivist Theory Of Justice (new Directions In Critical Theory),['Rainer Forst'],"<p>Contemporary philosophical pluralism recognizes the inevitability and legitimacy of multiple ethical perspectives and values, making it difficult to isolate the higher-order principles on which to base a theory of justice. Rising up to meet this challenge, Rainer Forst, a leading member of the Frankfurt School's newest generation of philosophers, conceives of an ""autonomous"" construction of justice founded on what he calls the basic moral right to justification.</p>
<p>Forst begins by identifying this right from the perspective of moral philosophy. Then, through an innovative, detailed critical analysis, he ties together the central components of social and political justice—freedom, democracy, equality, and toleration—and joins them to the right to justification. The resulting theory treats ""justificatory power"" as the central question of justice, and by adopting this approach, Forst argues, we can discursively work out, or ""construct,"" principles of justice, especially with respect to transnational justice and human rights issues.</p>
<p>As he builds his theory, Forst engages with the work of Anglo-American philosophers such as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Amartya Sen, and critical theorists such as Jürgen Habermas, Nancy Fraser, and Axel Honneth. Straddling multiple subjects, from politics and law to social protest and philosophical conceptions of practical reason, Forst brilliantly gathers contesting claims around a single, elastic theory of justice.</p>

Digital Capitalism: Networking The Global Market System,"['Schiller, Dan , 1951-']","<p>Cyberspace not only exemplifies but spearheads the greater political economy of which it has become such a critical part. The networks that comprise cyberspace were originally created at the behest of government agencies, military contractors, and allied educational institutions. However, over the past generation or so, a growing number of these networks began to serve primarily corporate users. Under the sway of an expansionary market logic, the Internet began a political-economic transition toward what Dan Schiller calls ""digital capitalism.""<br>
</p>
<p>Schiller traces these metamorphoses through three critically important and interlinked realms. Parts I and II deal with the overwhelmingly ""neoliberal"" or market-driven policies that influence and govern the telecommunications system and their empowerment of transnational corporations while at the same time exacerbating exisiting social inequalities. Part III shows how cyberspace offers uniquely supple instruments with which to cultivate and deepen consumerism on a transnational scale, especially among privileged groups. Finally, Part IV shows how digital capitalism has already overtaken education, placing it at the mercy of a proprietary market logic.</p>"
Cyberstalking: Harassment In The Internet Age And How To Protect Your Family,['Paul Bocij'],"<p>Cyberstalking is an entirely new form of deviant behavior that uses technology to harass others in a variety of ways. In less than a decade, our reliance on the Internet, email, instant messaging, chat rooms, and other communications technologies has made cyberstalking a growing social problem that can affect computer users anywhere in the world. This is the first book devoted entirely to an examination of cyberstalking, providing an overview of the problem, its causes and consequences, and practical advice for protecting yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p>New technologies have enriched our lives in countless ways. Yet these technologies can easily be misused to frighten, intimidate, coerce, harass, and victimize unsuspecting users. Cyberstalking is an entirely new form of deviant behavior that uses technology to harass others in a variety of ways. In less than a decade, our reliance on the Internet, email, instant messaging, chat rooms, and other communications technologies has made cyberstalking a growing social problem that can affect computer users anywhere in the world. This is the first book devoted entirely to an examination of cyberstalking, providing an overview of the problem, its causes and consequences, and practical advice for protecting yourself and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Although cyberstalking usually involves one person pursuing another, this is not always the case. As the behavior has evolved, it has come to include such acts as stock market fraud, identity theft, sexual harassment, data theft, impersonation, consumer fraud, computer monitoring, and attacks by political groups on government services. More disturbingly, pornographers and pedophiles have begun to use cyberstalking as a way of locating new victims. While cyberstalking has become a worldwide problem, most cases originate in the United States, making Americans the most vulnerable group of targets. Bocij carefully delineates the boundaries of cyberstalking, providing real-life examples, guidance for avoiding the pitfalls, and suggestions for what to do if you fall victim.</p>"
Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy,"['David Farrell Krell', 'David F. Krell']","<p>Daimon Life is life-enchancing. To read it is to become richer in wor(l)d. âJohn Llewelyn</p><p>Disclosure of Martin Heideggerâs complicity with the National Socialist regime in 1933-34 has provoked virulent debate about the relationship between his politics and his philosophy. Did Heideggerâs philosophy exhibit a kind of organicism readily transformed into ideological blood and soil? Or, rather, did his support of the Nazis betray a fundamental lack of loyalty to living things? David Farrell Krell traces Heideggerâs political authoritarianism to his failure to develop a constructive life-philosophy-his phobic reactions to other forms of being. Krell details Heideggerâs opposition to Lebensphilosophie as expressed in Being and Time, in an important but little-known lecture course on theoretical biology given in 1929â30 called The Basic Concepts of Metaphysics, and in a recently published key text, Contributions to Philosophy, written in 1936â38. Although Heideggerâs attempt to think through the problems of life, sexual reproduction, behavior, environment, and the ecosystem ultimately failed, Krell contends that his methods of thinking nonetheless pose important tasks for our own thought. Drawing on and away from Heidegger, Krell expands on the topics of life, death, sexuality, and spirit as these are treated by Freud, Nietzsche, Derrida, and Irigaray. Daimon Life addresses issues central to contemporary philosophies of politics, gender, ecology, and theoretical biology.</p>"
Dangerous Relationships,['Ph.d. Noelle C. Nelson'],"<p>Dangerous Relationships: How to Stop Domestic Violence before It Stops You takes a preventative approach to domestic violence by answering the question ""What can I do to avoid getting into a violent domestic relationship?,"" yet will also be helpful for those already in the midst of a violent relationship. Domestic violence does not suddenly appear out of a void. The majority of domestic violence incidents emerges from certain types of recognizable relationships. Dr. Noelle Nelson, a noted clinical psychologist and therapist, has helped many clients identify the common characteristics that run through most violent relationships, and thus avoid potentially dangerous heterosexual or same-sex relationships. Knowing what to look for and how to uncover a potentially abusive relationship before it ever gets to the physically violent stage greatly diminishes your chances of becoming a victim of domestic violence. The author clearly describes the seven warning signs attributed to these types of relationships, and advises how to proceed once you recognize such warning signs. Dr. Nelson systematically tracks and defines the characteristics of the potentially abusive domestic relationship through the development of four very different real-life scenarios: heterosexual lovers, husband and wife, homosexual lovers, and platonic female roommates. The situations discussed are composites of real events and real people, and they represent the most common relationships involving domestic violence. As different as these relationships may appear on the surface, Dr. Nelson shows they are actually very similar in their underlying dynamics. Dangerous Relationships ultimately points out that domestic violence can happen to anyone at any time regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation. The author's sole purpose is to help stop domestic violence between adults before it has a chance to start - and before the hurting begins.</p>

Living At The Edge : A Biography Of D.h. Lawrence And Frieda Von Richthofen / Michael Squires And Lynn K. Talbot,"['Squires, Michael , 1941-']","<p>Dashingly told and meticulously researched, this double biography of D. H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda von Richthofen is the first to draw fully on Frieda’s unpublished letters and on interviews with people who knew her well. It explores their collision with an industrial world they hated and chronicles the stormy relationship between husband and wife. The strong sexual vitality that inspired Lawrence’s art brought both joy and anguish to his marriage. Here, the Lawrences emerge as proud but not conceited in their unconventional lives, staunch in the face of fierce opposition from a conformist society.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Living at the Edge</i> follows the separate lives of Lawrence and Frieda up to their first meeting in 1912. Tracing their new life together, it depicts their grateful escape from the English Midlands; their discovery of exotic places where they made temporary homes—Italy, Cornwall, Australia, New Mexico, and Mexico; Lawrence’s courageous battle against illness; and, after his death in 1930, Frieda’s success in recreating the simple life on ranches near Taos, New Mexico, where she died in 1956.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the center of their story is Lawrence’s literary career. Biographers Squires and Talbot see Lawrence’s major novels—<i>The Rainbow, Women in Love, Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i>—as a fresh way to understand his turbulent and conflicted life. They reveal the extreme care with which he rewrote his personal experience to satisfy his deepest needs, and they introduce the many influential people who entered the Lawrences’ lives and work. The rich materials from Frieda’s letters reveal a different Lawrence—more difficult as a man but more interesting as an artist; they also reveal a different Frieda—more vibrant as a woman, more substantial as a companion. This superb biography gives both Lawrence and Frieda striking new dimensions.</p>"
"Competitiveness, Convergence, And International Specialization (the Mit Press)","['David Dollar', 'Edward N. Wolff']","<p>David Dollar and Edward Wolff look at claims that a deindustrialized United States is on the road to secondrate status in the global marketplace and find them to be both unfounded and simplistic. Their systematic and empirical investigation of the mechanisms through which countries like Japan and Germany have caught up with the United States in terms of productivity and standard of living will inform public debate about which government policies are likely to improve a nation's competitiveness.Looking at productivity convergence from the industry and subindustry level, Dollar and Wolff also examine questions of the relationship of productivity growth in individual industries to convergence of overall productivity in developed countries, the identification of industries crucial for aggregate productivity growth, the sources of productivity growth within industries, the relationship between international trade and productivity convergence, and whether the same mechanics of convergence are at work in developing countries.The authors' findings reveal, among other things, that the slowness of U.S. productivity growth relative to other nations is largely due to forces pushing for convergence of aggregate productivity levels. Although other countries have been catching up with the U.S., there is no evidence that they will surpass the US. or that the U.S.</p>
<p>has deindustrialized.Perhaps most important, Dollar and Wolff find that countries catch up by raising their productivity levels in all manufacturing industries, not by large shifts of their employment and output from low- to high-value-added sectors. The growing similarity of advanced economies in terms of overall productivity masks a continued high degree of specialization in particular industries. Today different countries are the productivity leaders in different industries. Accordingly, the authors recommend that public policy focus on institutions and policies to promote innovation in general, rather than in key industries, and on free trade rather than protectionism.David Dollar is Senior Economist at the World Bank. Edward N. Wolff is Professor of Economics at New York University.</p>"
Nazi Justiz: Law Of The Holocaust,['Richard L. Miller'],"<p>Death camps are the most enduring image of the Holocaust, but they were only the final expression of a destruction process that began in 1933. In that year the Nazi regime mobilized members of an entire society to destroy their neighbors. Lawmakers, judges, attorneys, and the rest of the legal system played a crucial role in reassuring good Germans that a war on Jews was legitimate. Nazi Justiz emphasizes the prewar years of a robust Western European nation at peace with all countries. Such emphasis demonstrates that a Holocaust can happen in any country sharing the heritage of Western civilization, and warns of the inevitable outcome once ordinary people are targeted in a destruction process.</p>
<p>Using original decrees, court decisions, and first-hand recollections of participants, Nazi Justiz documents how the German legal system transformed itself into a criminal organization. We see not only how the legal system shaped everyday life, but how good Germans and the business community benefited from the Holocaust. Germany in the 1930s—before the war—is emphasized. Such emphasis demonstrates that a Holocaust can happen in any country sharing the heritage of Western civilization, and warns of the inevitable outcome once ordinary people are targeted in a process of destruction. No other book has so much information on the Holocaust in peacetime Germany; indeed, the chapters on property confiscation and residential concentration are unique. With a richness of detail evoking an immediacy normally found in novels, Nazi Justiz offers a chilling portrayal of persons filled with so much goodness that they become oblivious to horrors they cause.</p>"

Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America,['Scott M. Beekman'],"<p>Despite its status as one of the oldest and most enduringly popular sports in history, wrestling has been pushed to the background of the current American sports scene. Most people today would have a hard time even considering wrestling (with some of its modern theatrics) in the same terms as track and field or boxing. But until the 1920s, wrestling stood as a legitimate professional sport in this country, and a widely practiced amateur one as well. Its past respectability may not have endured, but the advent of cable television in the 1980s offered the sport a renewed opportunity to play a determining role in American popular culture. This opportunity was not wasted, and wrestlers now assume places in politics and film at the highest levels. <i>Ringside</i>, the first work to fully examine the history of professional wrestling in this country, provides an illuminating and colorful account of all of the various athletes, entertainers, businessmen, and national outlooks that have determined wrestling's erratic route through American history.</p><p>This chronological work begins with a brief account of wrestling's global history, and then proceeds to investigate the sport's growth as a specifically American institution. Wrestling has continued to survive in the face of technological developments, scandals, public ridicule, and a lack of centralized control, and today this supremely adaptable entertainment form represents, in sum, an international industry capable of attracting enormous television and pay-per-view audiences, along with massive amounts of advertising and merchandizing revenue. <i>Ringside</i> focuses on the business of wrestling as well as on the performers and their in-ring antics, and offers readers a fully nuanced examination of the development of professional wrestling in America.</p>"

How Images Think (the Mit Press),['Ron Burnett'],"<p>Digital images are an integral part of all media, including television, film,photography, animation, video games, data visualization, and the Internet. In the digital world,spectators become navigators wending their way through a variety of interactive experiences, and images become spaces of visualization with more and more intelligence programmed into the very fabric of communication processes. In How Images Think, Ron Burnett explores this new ecology, which has transformed the relationships humans have with the image-based technologies they have created.</p>
<p>So much intelligence has been programmed into these image-dependent technologies that it often seems as if images are ""thinking""; ascribing thought to machines redefines our relationship with them and enlarges our ideas about body and mind. Burnett argues that the development of this new, closely interdependent relationship marks a turning point in our understanding of the connections between humans and machines.After presenting an overview of visual perception, Burnett examines the interactive modes of new technologies — including computer games, virtual reality, digital photography, and film — and locates digital images in a historical context. He argues that virtual images occupy a ""middle space,"" combining the virtual and the real into an environment of visualization that blurs the distinctions between subject and object — part of a continuum of experiences generated by creative choices by viewers, the results of which cannot be attributed either to images or to participants.</p>"
Designing Interactions (the Mit Press),['Bill Moggridge'],"<p>Digital technology has changed the way we interact with everything from the games we play to the tools we use at work. Designers of digital technology products no longer regard their job as designing a physical object—beautiful or utilitarian—but as designing our interactions with it. In Designing Interactions, award-winning designer Bill Moggridge introduces us to forty influential designers who have shaped our interaction with technology. Moggridge, designer of the first laptop computer (the GRiD Compass, 1981) and a founder of the design firm IDEO, tells us these stories from an industry insider's viewpoint, tracing the evolution of ideas from inspiration to outcome. The innovators he interviews—including Will Wright, creator of The Sims, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, and Doug Engelbart, Bill Atkinson, and others involved in the invention and development of the mouse and the desktop—have been instrumental in making a difference in the design of interactions. Their stories chart the history of entrepreneurial design development for technology.Moggridge and his interviewees discuss such questions as why a personal computer has a window in a desktop, what made Palm's handheld organizers so successful, what turns a game into a hobby, why Google is the search engine of choice, and why 30 million people in Japan choose the i-mode service for their cell phones. And Moggridge tells the story of his own design process and explains the focus on people and prototypes that has been successful at IDEO—how the needs and desires of people can inspire innovative designs and how prototyping methods are evolving for the design of digital technology.Designing Interactions is illustrated with more than 700images, with color throughout. Accompanying the book is a DVD that contains segments from all the interviews intercut with examples of the interactions under discussion.Interviews with:Bill Atkinson• Durrell Bishop • Brendan Boyle • Dennis Boyle • Paul Bradley • Duane Bray• Sergey Brin • Stu Card • Gillian Crampton Smith • Chris Downs• Tony Dunne• John Ellenby • Doug Englebart • Jane Fulton Suri • Bill Gaver • Bing Gordon • Rob Haitani • Jeff Hawkins • Matt Hunter • Hiroshi Ishii • Bert Keely • David Kelley • Rikako Kojima • Brenda Laurel • David Liddle •Lavrans Løvlie • John Maeda • Paul Mercer • Tim Mott • Joy Mountford •Takeshi Natsuno • Larry Page • Mark Podlaseck • Fiona Raby • Cordell Ratzlaff• Ben Reason • Jun Rekimoto • Steve Rogers • Fran Samalionis • Larry Tesler• Bill Verplank • Terry Winograd • Will Wright</p>"
Language And Cultural Diversity In U.s. Schools: Democratic Principles In Action (educate Us),['Terry A. Osborn'],"<p>Diversity is at the heart of today's education debates. Often, school policies and programs designed to encourage and embrace diversity are met with public ire and a deep misunderstanding of how diversity serves learning. This work explains how diversity is an essential element in classroom settings. As children from around the world continue to pour into U.S. classrooms, an understanding of cultural and linguistic diversity in its broadest sense moves to the foreground. In a post 9/11 world, the benefits of understanding diversity take on urgent meaning.</p>
<p>The introdutory chapter, Participating in Democracy Means Participating in Schools, sets the tone for the discussion to follow. As the geographic backgrounds of immigrants becomes increasingly diverse, religion must be added to previous discussions of race, ethnicity, and language. Thus, the need for the public to understand how shifts in population affect schools, makes this work a vital resource for anyone concerned with education today.</p>"
The Unbalanced Mind,['Julian Leff'],"<p>Do defective genes give rise to defective thought? The revolution in molecular genetics has indeed given rise to the increasing optimism that advancements in biotechnology will soon uncover the causes of all disturbances of mind and behavior. In this book, leading psychiatrist Julian Leff counters this reductionist claim and emphasizes what is known about the psychological, social, and cultural factors underlying mental illness. In doing so, he addresses many serious and urgent questions. What exactly is the difference between sadness and depression? What are the difficulties in categorizing psychiatric conditions? How are psychiatric diagnoses made in the first place? Are international attempts to standardize diagnosis flawed? Can doctors ever hope to disentangle cause and effect in the treatment of mental illness? What is the influence of emotional relationships on psychiatric conditions? How do public attitudes to mental illness affect choices of treatment? And, finally, what does all this tell us about the cultural causes of mental illness?</p>
<p>Throughout the book Leff also takes stock of the origins and effects of many medications used to treat mental illnesses, from antidepressants such as Prozac to Thorazine, a drug used to treat patients with delusions and hallucinations. Showing how broad social and community forces play into human development, he highlights the importance of life events and external forces in the origin and treatment of depression and schizophrenia. Leff acknowledges the biological basis of mental activity, but underscores the vital role of the social environment.</p>
<p><i>The Unbalanced Mind</i> addresses such questions as:</p>
<p>* Why was there a lower rate of diagnosis of schizophrenia in Great Britain than in the United States?</p>

Doc: Memories From A Life In Public Service (indiana),['Otis R. Bowen'],"<p>Doc Memories from a Life in Public Service Otis R. Bowen, with William Du Bois, Jr.</p>
<p>The autobiography of Otis R. Bowen, Indiana’s most popular and best-known governor.</p>
<p>""Being governor is like no other job although it has similarities to being a country doctor. Like a physician, a governor is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, asleep, awake, eating, in the shower, traveling in a car, or at a meeting. There are emergencies, so he lives with unpredictability. As earlier noted, many state government activities involve health and medical questions, areas in which I have expertise. There, the similarities end. There is nothing like being governor, not even being a member of a president’s Cabinet.""—from Doc</p>
<p>No Indiana governor in the 20th century has been more popular or successful than Otis R. Bowen. In his long-awaited autobiography, ""Doc"" writes in rich detail about the hard work and persistence that got him into and through medical school. His commitment to serving people made him a beloved family physician in Bremen, a respected state legislator and legislative leader, and one of the most esteemed governors in Indiana history.</p>
<p>Otis Bowen grew up poor in Fulton County, but was rich in the things that matter. With the support of his parents, siblings, teachers and friends, he pursued a dream of becoming a family physician, making many sacrifices to finance his way through medical school</p>
<p>As a newly minted doctor, Bowen first practiced medicine in the Army. He describes his experience on the field of combat in the Pacific during the last major battle of World War II, and tells of his life after coming home from the war to serve the medical needs of a small northern Indiana community. We learn, too, of his personal life, about his own family and his first two wives, Beth Bowen and Rose Bowen, the loneliness and emptiness he endured after they died painfully of cancer, and how his third wife, Carol, has filled that void.</p>
<p>An almost accidental entry into politics and public life led Bowen to the capitals of Indiana and the nation. Drafted as a candidate for Marshall County coroner in 1952, Bowen moved up from that office to become a member of the Indiana House of Representatives, to House leadership as Minority Leader and Speaker, to the governor’s office in 1973, and to President Ronald Reagan’s cabinet in 1985. The first person to serve eight consecutive years as Indiana’s Governor, Bowen candidly explores the challenges, crises and triumphs of that period. In an equally candid way, he recounts his efforts and frustrations as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>As warm, down-to-earth, and genuine as its subject, Doc will be welcomed by all Hoosiers, no matter their political stripe.</p>
<p>William Du Bois, Jr., Hoosier by birth, spent 20 years as a journalist, half of that period as editor of Portland and Muncie newspapers. He later served on the executive staffs of governors Otis R. Bowen and Robert D. Orr. Before retiring in 1998, Du Bois also spent a decade in higher education as president of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Indiana (an association of Indiana’s private colleges and universities) and as the system marketing and public relations director for Ivy Tech State College.</p>"

Connections And Symbols (cognition Special Issue),"['Pinker', 'Steven']","<p>Does intelligence result from the manipulation of structured symbolic expressions? Or is it the result of the activation of large networks of densely interconnected simple units? Connections and Symbols provides the first systematic analysis of the explosive new field of Connectionism that is challenging the basic tenets of cognitive science.These lively discussions by Jerry A. Fodor, Zenon W. Pylyshyn, Steven Pinker, Alan Prince, Joel Lechter, and Thomas G. Bever raise issues that lie at the core of our understanding of how the mind works: Does connectionism offer it truly new scientific model or does it merely cloak the old notion of associationism as a central doctrine of learning and mental functioning? Which of the new empirical generalizations are sound and which are false? And which of the many ideas such as massively parallel processing,distributed representation, constraint satisfaction, and subsymbolic or microfeatural analyses belong together, and which are logically independent? Now that connectionism has arrived with full-blown models of psychological processes as diverse as Pavlovian conditioning, visual recognition, and language acquisition, the debate is on. Common themes emerge from all the contributors to Connections and Symbols: criticism of connectionist models applied to language or the parts of cognition employing language like operations; and a focus on what it is about human cognition that supports the traditional physical symbol system hypothesis. While criticizing many aspects of connectionist models, the authors also identify aspects of cognition that could he explained by the connectionist models.Steven Pinker is Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Co-Director of, the Center for Cognitive Science at MIT. Connections and Symbols is included in the Cognition Special Issue series, edited by Jacques Mehler.</p>"
Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation,['Chris Turner'],"<p>D'oh-it's The Simpsons. And here's the book with the behind-the-scenes story of how America's favorite nuclear family first arrived at a TV near you, how the series grew into a worldwide icon, and who brings it to life so brilliantly week after week, year after year. Since first airing in 1987 as a cartoon interlude on the short-lived Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons has deliciously skewered the foibles of American life, evolving into a cultural institution that reaches across the generations. As satire, it's sharp and funny. As a pop phenom, it's in a league of its own. And with <i>Planet Simpson</i>, it finally gets the sprawling, multidimensional critical look it so richly deserves. Smart and funny, Turner writes with fitting enthusiasm for his subject while working in seemly references to cultural theory and TV-insider politics. His book is just the thing for fellow fans, and for anyone interested in how pop phenomena came to be. -<i>Hollywood Reporter</i> This book was not prepared, licensed, approved, or endorsed by any entity involved in creating or producing the television series The Simpsons.</p>"
We Don't Exactly Get The Welcome Wagon,['Gerald Mallon'],"<p>Drawing on over twenty years of child welfare experience and extensive interviews with 54 gay and lesbian young people who lived in out-of-home-care child welfare settings in three North American cities -- Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto -- Gerald Mallon presents narratives of marginalized young people trying to find the ""right fit."" Mallon permits the voices of these young people to guide the research, allowing them to tell their own stories and to suggest what is important in their own words. Their experiences help the reader to begin to understand the discrepancies between the myths and misinformation about gay and lesbian adolescents and their realities in the out-of-home child welfare systems in which they live.</p>
<p>The first comprehensive examination of the experiences of gay and lesbian youths in the child welfare system, <i>We Don't Exactly Get the Welcome Wagon</i> makes solid recommendations to social work practitioners as well as to policy makers about how they can provide a competent practice for gay and lesbian adolescents, and offers a methods chapter which will be useful in classroom instruction.</p>

Looking Into The Eyes Of A Killer: A Psychiatrist's Journey Through The Murderer's World,"['Ross, Drew.']","<p>Drew Ross explores the many contradictions and misconceptions that prevail when juries and judges evaluate insanity pleas and issues of blame. From 1990-1997, Ross served as a forensic psychiatrist for the criminal justice system. His job was to judge the ""sanity"" of people charged with murder. The law requires black and white answers: Did someone kill because of a psychosis? Should he or she be confined to a prison or to a mental hospital? What makes a person into a killer? In session after session, Ross was drawn into the killers' - and their victims' - nightmares. Unfortunately his training had taught him that the human mind is more complex than the law would allow, and little by little, he began to find his role unbearable. Looking into the Eyes of a Killer details one man's journey into the darkness of the human psyche and the evils of a system. Examining the record and searching his own soul, Ross looks at the degree to which murder is aberrant and chillingly reveals how killers are not always so different from the rest of us. Never falling prey to easy solutions, he makes a compelling argument for new guidelines for dealing with violent criminals, and shows how our failure to ""reform"" them springs from our unwillingness to confront ourselves.</p>"
The education of John Dewey: a biography,"['Martin, Jay , 1935-']","<p>During John Dewey's lifetime (1859-1952), one public opinion poll after another revealed that he was esteemed to be one of the ten most important thinkers in American history. His body of thought, conventionally identified by the shorthand word ""Pragmatism,"" has been the distinctive American philosophy of the last fifty years. His work on education is famous worldwide and is still influential today, anticipating as it did the ascendance in contemporary American pedagogy of multiculturalism and independent thinking. His University of Chicago Laboratory School (founded in 1896) thrives still and is a model for schools worldwide, especially in emerging democracies. But how was this lifetime of thought enmeshed in Dewey's emotional experience, in his joys and sorrows as son and brother, husband and father, and in his political activism and spirituality? Acclaimed biographer Jay Martin recaptures the unity of Dewey's life and work, tracing important themes through the philosopher's childhood years, family history, religious experience, and influential friendships.</p>
<p>Based on original sources, notably the vast collection of unpublished papers in the Center for Dewey Studies, this book tells the full story, for the first time, of the life and times of the eminent American philosopher, pragmatist, education reformer, and man of letters. In particular, <i>The Education of John Dewey</i> highlights the importance of the women in Dewey's life, especially his mother, wife, and daughters, but also others, including the reformer Jane Addams and the novelist Anzia Yezierska. A fitting tribute to a master thinker, Martin has rendered a tour de force portrait of a philosopher and social activist in full, seamlessly reintegrating Dewey's thought into both his personal life and the broader historical themes of his time.</p>

Democracy Within Reason: Technocratic Revolution In Mexico,['Miguel Angel Centeno'],"<p>During the 1980s the Mexican regime faced a series of economic, social, and political disasters that led many to question its survival. Yet by 1992 the economy was again growing, with inflation under control and the confidence of international investors restored. Mexico was now touted as an example for regimes in Eastern Europe to emulate.</p>
<p>How did Carlos Salinas and his team of technocrats manage to gain political power sufficient to impose their economic model? How did they sustain their revolution from above despite the hardships these changes brought for many Mexicans? How did they stage their remarkable political comeback and create their “democracy within reason”? Why did Salinas succeed in keeping control of his revolution while Mikhail Gorbachev failed to do so in his similar effort at radical reform?</p>
<p>Miguel Centeno addresses these questions by analyzing three critical developments in the Mexican state: the centralization of power within the bureaucracy; the rise of a new generation of technocrats and their use of a complex system of political networks; and the dominance of a neoliberal ideology and technocratic vision that guided policy decisions and limited democratic participation. In his conclusion the author proposes some alternative scenarios for Mexico’s future, including the role of NAFTA, and suggests lessons for the study of regimes undertaking similar transitions.</p>
<p>Of obvious interest to students of contemporary Mexico and Latin America, the book will also be very useful for those analyzing the transition to the market in other countries, the role of knowledge in public policy, and the nature of the modern state in general.</p>

Voices In The Purple Haze: Underground Radio And The Sixties,"['Keith, Michael C. , 1945-']","<p>During the fateful summer of 1966, a handful of restless and frustrated deejays in New York and San Francisco began to conceive of a whole new brand of radio, one which would lead to the reinvention of contemporary music programming. Gone were the screaming deejays, the two minute doowop hits, and the goofy jingles. In were the counterculture sounds and sentiments that had seldom, if ever, made it to commercial radio. This new and unorthodox form of radio—this radical departure from the Top 40 establishment—reflected the social and cultural unrest of the period. Underground radio had been born of a desire to restore substance and meaning to a medium that had fallen victim to the bottom-line dictates of an industry devoted to profit. In this compelling and intriguing account of the counterculture radio movement, over 30 pioneers of the underground airwaves share insights and observations, and tell it like it was.</p>
<p>Michael Keith has interviewed some of the most prominent figures of underground radio and has woven their reflections into a seamless, engrossing oral history of one of radio's most extraordinary moments. From the first broadcasts of a Screamin' Jay Hawkins record and a live Love-In and Be-In Rock 'n Roll concert, to the ultimate corporate takeover of the commercial underground airwaves, Keith provides the reader with a unique and fresh look at this turbulent era. There had never been anything like commercial underground radio before its '60s debut, and there has not been anything like it since its premature demise in the early 1970s. The innovativeness and boldness of underground radio brought a new golden age to the medium. Ignoring playlists, rigid programming formulas and program clocks, the underground deejays attracted a dedicated following of maturing baby boomers.</p>"
The Planets,"['David Mcnab', 'James Younger']","<p>During the last forty years, human beings have broken free of the Earth and ventured out to other worlds orbiting the Sun. We have visited every planet except Pluto, discovered dozens of new moons in orbit around other planets, and put to rest myths and fantasies that have been accepted for centuries. This magnificent book chronicles our planetary travels, explains the creation and evolution of each planet, and tells how our understanding of the solar system has developed from the first stargazers in ancient times to Galileo to the present.<br>
In an engaging narrative that draws on interviews with U.S. and Soviet scientists and astronauts, state-of-the-art computer graphics, and space race archives, David McNab and James Younger reveal the wonders of the planets. With the help of striking pictures from the <i>Apollo, Voyager, Pioneer,</i> and <i>Viking</i> space missions, the authors describe planetary marvels: volcanoes three times the size of Mount Everest, worlds with seas of methane, rivers of lava longer than the Nile, clouds of sulfuric acid, and frosts of pure shining metal. They also investigate the possibilities of life elsewhere in the solar system, present a new perspective on the Sun and on Earth’s atmosphere, and speculate about the evolution of the solar system over the next five billion years—to what may be its death.<br>

The Heretic In Darwin's Court: The Life Of Alfred Russel Wallace,['Ross A. Slotten'],"<p>During their lifetimes, Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin shared credit and fame for the independent and near-simultaneous discovery of natural selection. Together, the two men spearheaded one of the greatest intellectual revolutions in modern history, and their rivalry, usually amicable but occasionally acrimonious, forged modern evolutionary theory. Yet today, few people today know much about Wallace.</p>
<p><i>The Heretic in Darwin's Court</i> explores the controversial life and scientific contributions of Alfred Russel Wallace -- Victorian traveler, scientist, spiritualist, and co-discoverer with Charles Darwin of natural selection. After examining his early years, the biography turns to Wallace's twelve years of often harrowing travels in the western and eastern tropics, which place him in the pantheon of the greatest explorer-naturalists of the nineteenth century. Tracing step-by-step his discovery of natural selection -- a piece of scientific detective work as revolutionary in its implications as the discovery of the structure of DNA -- the book then follows the remaining fifty years of Wallace's eccentric and entertaining life. In addition to his divergence from Darwin on two fundamental issues -- sexual selection and the origin of the human mind -- he pursued topics that most scientific figures of his day conspicuously avoided, including spiritualism, phrenology, mesmerism, environmentalism, and life on Mars.</p>
<p>Although there may be disagreement about his conclusions, Wallace's intellectual investigations into the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe itself remain some of the most inspired scientific accomplishments in history. This authoritative biography casts new light on the life and work of Alfred Russel Wallace and the importance of his twenty-five-year relationship with Charles Darwin.</p>"

"A Token Of My Affection: Greeting Cards And American Business Culture (popular Cultures, Everyday Lives)",['Barry Shank'],"<p>Each year in the United States, millions of mass-produced greeting cards proclaim their occasional messages: ""For My Loving Daughter,"" ""On the Occasion of Your Marriage,"" and ""It's a Boy!"" For more than 150 years, greeting cards have tapped into and organized a shared language of love, affection, and kinship, becoming an integral part of American life and culture. Contemporary incarnations of these emotional transactions performed through small bits of decorated paper are often dismissed as vacuous clichés employing worn-out stereotypes. Nevertheless, the relationship of greeting cards to systems of material production is well worth studying and understanding, for the modern greeting card is the product of an industry whose values and aims seem to contradict the sentiments that most cards express. In fact, greeting cards articulate shifting forms of love and affiliation experienced by people whose lives have been shaped by the major economic changes of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. <i>A Token of My Affection</i> shows in fascinating detail how the evolution of the greeting card reveals the fundamental power of economic organization to enable and constrain experiences of longing, status, desire, social connectedness, and love and to structure and partially determine the most private, internal, and intimate of feelings.</p>
<p>Beautifully illustrated, <i>A Token of My Affection</i> follows the development of the modern greeting card industry from the 1840s, as a way of recovering that most elusive of things -- the emotional subjectivity of another age. Barry Shank charts the evolution of the greeting card from an afterthought to a traditional printing and stationery business in the mid-nineteenth century to a multibillion-dollar industry a hundred years later. He explains what an industry devoted to emotional sincerity means for the lives of all Americans. Blending archival research in business history with a study of surviving artifacts and a literary analysis of a broad range of relevant texts and primary sources, Shank demonstrates the power of business to affect love and the ability of love to find its way in the marketplace of consumer society.</p>

Although this connection is crucial to our understanding of what monetary policy can and cannot accomplish, opinions about its basic properties have swung widely over the years.Today, virtually everyone studying monetary policy acknowledges that, contrary to what many modern macroeconomic models suggest, central bank actions often affect both inflation and measures of real economic activity, such as output, unemployment, and incomes.

Embodied Conversational Agents (mit Press),"['Cassell, Justine']","<p>Embodied conversational agents are computer-generated cartoonlike characters that demonstrate many of the same properties as humans in face-to-face conversation, including the ability to produce and respond to verbal and nonverbal communication. They constitute a type of (a)multimodal interface where the modalities are those natural to human conversation: speech, facial displays, hand gestures, and body stance; (b) software agent, insofar as they represent the computer in an interaction with a human or represent their human users in a computational environment (as avatars, for example); and (c) dialogue system where both verbal and nonverbal devices advance and regulate the dialogue between the user and the computer. With an embodied conversational agent, the visual dimension of interacting with an animated character on a screen plays an intrinsic role. Not just pretty pictures, the graphics display visual features of conversation in the same way that the face and hands do in face-to-face conversation among humans.This book describes research in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of embodied conversational agents as well as details of specific working systems. Many of the chapters are written by multidisciplinary teams of psychologists, linguists, computer scientists, artists, and researchers in interface design.

"U.S. Military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell Policy: A Reference Handbook [Contemporary Military, Strategic, and Security Issues Series]","['Melissa Sheridan Embser-Herbert Ph.D.', 'Lawrence J. Korb']","<p>Embser-Herbert explores the history of the policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, (DADT) the federal law restricting the military service of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. In this narrative overview, she traces the policy from its origins in the early 1990s, through its evolution and implementation into law in the United States military, before evaluating the impact of post-9/11 events on the military, the policy, and the ongoing debate surrounding the existence of the policy itself as lawmakers consider its repeal.</p><p>Her three-part history of DADT begins with a brief look at earlier policies that preceded it, a discussion of events in 1992-1993 that resulted in the passage and implementation of the new law, and an examination of the law's impact on the military. She also compares the policy to that of other nations, such as Canada, Australia, and Great Britain, that eliminated similar restrictions as they sought ways to avoid a potential manpower shortage in their armed forces.</p><p>The War on Terror has returned DADT to the public spotlight. Embser-Herbert examines U.S. experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan and what they can teach about gays and lesbians in the military.

Part II of the handbook provides summaries of key legal decisions, and Part III contains key documents, such as the language of the law itself and excerpts from current military regulations and training manuals.</p>"
"Unlocking Energy Innovation: How America Can Build a Low-Cost, Low-Carbon Energy System","['Richard K. Lester', 'David M. Hart']","<p>Energy innovation offers us our best chance to solve the three urgent and interrelated problems of climate change, worldwide insecurity over energy supplies, and rapidly growing energy demand. But if we are to achieve a timely transition to reliable, low-cost,low-carbon energy, the U.S. energy innovation system must be radically overhauled. Unlocking Energy Innovation outlines an up-to-the-minute plan for remaking America's energy innovation system by tapping the country's entrepreneurial strengths and regional diversity in both the public and private spheres. The authors map three waves of energy innovation to show how we can speed up the introduction of new technologies and business models and accelerate their deployment on a massive scale. Business as usual will not fill the energy innovation gap. Nor will wishful thinking-common enough today, with politicians and others talking up some technologies, talking down others, and claiming that if we price it, or if we mandate it, or if we simply say it often and inspiringly enough, the innovations will flow. Only the kind of systemic, transformative changes to our energy innovation system described in this provocative book will help us avert the most dire scenarios and achieve a sustainable and secure energy future.</p>"

"Parables And Other Allegories: The Work Of Melvin Charney, 1975-1990",['Melvin Charney'],"<p>Essays by Patricia Phillips, Phyllis Lambert, and Robert-Jan van Pelt Melvin Charney is an artist and architect from Montreal whose site-related installations, drawings, collages, and texts have raised questions and stimulated discussion on such topics as the nature of the city and the connections between the built environment and the world of ideas. This richly illustrated book documents a body of work that has previously been seen only in isolation, disclosing the concerns of an artist who perceives artistic, social, and political spheres as mutually related and interwoven.Much of Charney's early work, including Les Maisons de la rue Sherbrooke, A Chicago Construction, and A Toronto Construction, has been purposefully ephemeral. Moving in a different direction, several of his more recent projects, such as the Canadian Tribute to Human Rights and The CCA Garden, are permanent and publicly accessible.Parables and Other Allegories offers a comprehensive historical record of Charney's work. Over 200 illustrations, including 95 color reproductions and 96 duotones, along with Charney's own commentary, provide a critical context for his oeuvre. An introduction by Alessandra, Latour, guest curator of the exhibition, and essays by Patricia C. Phillips and Robert-Jan van Pelt explore various aspects of his projects, among them the roles of collective memory and reiterative narrative as well as the harrowing, shamanic investigations of history and monumental evil in the German Series. An interview by Phyllis Lambert investigates how Charney approaches his work and considers a wide range of issues such as abstraction and representation, the notion of space, and the idea of process as meaning.</p>"
Women's Decision-making: Common Themes . . . Irish Voices,['Nancy W. Veeder'],"<p>Essential characteristics of women's decision-making have long been ignored or, if considered at all, have been viewed in relationship to male-based factors. Veeder, drawing on experiences of Irish women, establishes that women making important choices do so differently than men. The women, ranging in age from as young as thirteen to over sixty-five, were divided into three age groupings, thereby offering insights into variables over much of the life-span. Themes, born from common experiences, emerge from the poignant, compelling accounts of individual women. The author's analysis and commentary structure the book's development and maintain its focus on the context wherein women make their private, but immensely important, decisions, the family. Education, vocation, marriage, and childbearing are considered relative to the thought and emotional factors that influenced the women's decisions. Veeder concludes that women show strength and insight in their approach to choices. She sees women, in comparison with men, as taking more factors into consideration, being more aware of consequences, being more practical, flexible, and valuing of relationships. Women's participation in the workforce and their increased societal roles make this a most timely book. It is, too, an important contribution to, and stimulus for, additional research on gender and decision-making.</p>"

The Entrepreneur's Guide To Managing Growth And Handling Crises,['Theo J. Van Dijk'],"<p>Everyone knows the typical entrepreneurial success story: A couple of entrepreneurs have a great idea, work their tails off to establish the business and, before long, they're set for life. Right? Hardly. Turnaround artist Theo van Dijk knows two things: First, young businesses that have survived the start-up years will face periods of stagnation. Second, every venture at some point reaches a complacent plateau, owners take their eyes off the ball, and—wham!—a crisis charges through the door. Entrepreneurs can avoid that fate by watching for signs of trouble and taking the action steps van Dijk outlines. And it's worth the effort, because troubles and crises all have a silver lining—they position the company for greater, long-term growth.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs, predictably, become overconfident just when they think they have it made. A crisis of leadership and/or direction then occurs, and it usually has to do with mismanaged growth. Suddenly, the company can't fill orders, or customers complain about service and delivery. Or family bickering slows momentum just when the company is poised to take off. Theo van Dijk has seen it all, and he knows what the real problem is. During the start-up years, everyone is focused on creating a product and building a list of customers. Informality and flexibility are the rule. But at some point, what used to work no longer does. Survival is once again at stake and the odds are once again very much against the survivors of the early entrepreneurial phase. It's right at this point, van Dijk argues, that the structure of the organization needs to become more formal and built to last. He shows many ways companies in crisis can overcome challenges by changing the way they handle customers, putting new processes and procedures in place, and managing employees in a more professional manner. This work is painful, but it's necessary if the company is to survive trouble and set a course for long-term growth.</p>"
"Evolution And Human Behavior: Darwinian Perspectives On Human Nature, 2nd Edition (a Bradford Book)",['John Cartwright'],"<p>Evolutionary psychology occupies an important place in the drive to understand and explain human behavior. Darwinian ideas provide powerful tools to illuminate how fundamental aspects of the way humans think, feel, and interact derive from reproductive interests and an ultimate need for survival. In this updated and expanded edition of Evolution and Human Behavior, John Cartwright considers the emergence of Homo sapiens as a species and looks at contemporary issues, such as familial relationships and conflict and cooperation, in light of key theoretical principles. The book covers basic concepts including natural and sexual selection, life history theory, and the fundamentals of genetics. New material will be found in chapters on emotion, culture, incest avoidance, ethics, and cognition and reasoning. Two new chapters are devoted to the evolutionary analysis of mental disorders. Students of psychology, human biology, and physical and cultural anthropology will find Evolution and Human Behavior a comprehensive textbook of great value.</p>"
"XY, on masculine identity",['Lydia Davis'],"<p>Examining changing role models for masculine identity-from cowboy in the 1950s to Terminator in the 1990s, from flesh-and-blood man to machine-this book suggests that men need new role models and that sufficient room needs to be left for the expression of male vulnerability, a psychic space that would accept attitudes and behaviors traditionally labeled as feminine. This new model, Badinter argues, may reduce the profound effects of homophobia and misogyny.</p>                        <p>A <i>New York Times</i> New and Noteworthy Paperback</p>"
Berlin Calling: American Broadcasters In Service To The Third Reich,"['Edwards, John Carver.']","<p>Expatriates posing as detached yet patriotic American commentators, and using the news-of-the-day voice of the stereotypical radio announcer, sought to turn U.S. opinion against the British and achieve the political objectives of their media-savvy employer--master propagandist Paul Josef Goebbels. Riveting biographies in <i>Berlin Calling</i> put real names and faces behind the voices of The Georgia Peach, Mr. O.K., Paul Revere, and others. Were they motivated by antipathy towards New Deal programs or were they simply hucksters in search of a payroll check? Ten years on historical research have culminated in a landmark book with intriguing answers to these puzzling questions.</p>
<p>Published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of America's entry into World War II, this volume chronicles the careers of eight U.S.A. Zone commentators who worked for Nazi propagandist Josef Goebbels. Drawing upon a variety of documentary sources--letters written by the subjects to family, friends, and colleagues; treason trial transcripts; the contents of the BBC's wartime monitoring service; and FBI case files on the broadcasters--the author explores each broadcaster's political and personal motivations, and the influence of their broadcasts.</p>"
Childhood Lost: How American Culture Is Failing Our Kids (childhood In America),['Sharna Olfman'],"<p>Experts from across disciplines join forces here to focus attention on current American culture and the devastating effects it is having on its children. From children developing surprising physical maturity and sexual awareness at younger and younger ages, to those estranged when television and computer screens replace family time, and those warped by national junk food/fast food habits bringing an explosion of obesity and diabetes among boys and girls, this book takes a harsh look at the results of American social norms. The damage being done by governmental policies is examined, including inadequate parental leave, a minimum wage that is not a living wage, unregulated day care, and a public education system that delivers inferior education to poor children. A call to action, this is a work from some of the best-known child experts nationwide. Every person who has or cares about a child will find this of interest.</p>

James M. Dennis offers a fresh and sophisticated look at the modernist tendencies of this trio of American painters, arguing that the individual styles of Wood, Benton, and Curry were both mislabeled and misunderstood. Revisiting the artistic and political culture of America between the World Wars, he shows that critics and ideologues—from <i>Time Magazine</i> to the <i>Partisan Review</i>—pigeonholed, praised, or pilloried the Regionalists to serve their own critical intentions.</p>"
Gun Control: Threat To Liberty Or Defense Against Anarchy?,"['Edel, Wilbur.']","<p>Federal restrictions on the sale and possession of some firearms were introduced during Prohibition when illegal rumrunners battling for territorial rights commonly used machine guns to destroy the opposition. More sweeping legislation was not passed until 1968, and from that time on the struggle has been between pro- and anti-control forces, with more controls created at state and local levels than at the federal level. However, the mood in Washington has turned, and the question now is how the country can be weaned away from the violence that pervades every aspect of living, from lawlessness to literature, entertainment, and even children's toys. This book traces the history of these gun control measures from the early days to our own violent age.</p>
<p>This is a study of a part of American history that deals not just with gun control as such, but with basic concepts of personal liberty, government responsibility, and the fear of tyranny. All three of these influenced the people who took up arms in the American Revolution and who, for decades afterward, resisted every effort of the central government to substitute a standing army for the armed militia of the states. As the nation grew in size and population, the need for a standing army became apparent, and the nature of the militia changed from that of a purely state organization to an adjunct of the regular army. Still, the view that private individuals were entitled to purchase and keep firearms for their personal use persisted. That this was not a constitutional right was made clear by the Supreme Court in a series of cases beginning as early as 1876.</p>

Serious students of American military history will appreciate the opportunity to compare nearly a century of changing interpretations with a most valuable primary source. The editor of the <i>Bilibid Diary</i>, Feuer has once again rendered conspicious service to the historical profession.</p>
<p><i>Barry F. Machado Professor of History Washington and Lee University</i></p>
<p>The story of the Old Army as revealed through the eyes of Colonel Jacob Kreps, this book dramatically portrays life in action with the U.S. Infantry on the Western frontier, in the Spanish-American War, and in the Philippine Insurrection.

Coordinating Technology: Studies In The International Standardization Of Telecommunications,"['Schmidt, Susanne K.']","<p>Few modern technologies are designed to stand alone. Because most machines must now fit into systems and be compatible with other technologies, the creation of standards has become a fundamental element of design and engineering. Conflicts such as the ""color television war"" of the1970s and recent disputes over high-definition television (HDTV) highlight the complexities of the standard-setting process.Susanne Schmidt and Raymund Werle present three case studies from the telecommunications industry to highlight the actors, the process, the politics, and the influence exerted by international organizations in the construction of standards. The case studies include the standards for facsimile terminals and transmission, videotex (a service that, with the exception of the French Minitel service, largely failed), and for electronic mail. The authors follow each trail from the realization by certain actors of the need for a standard, through the complex negotiation processes involving many economic, political, and social interests, to the final agreement on a standard. Throughout their stories, they emphasize the institutional embeddedness of these processes, demonstrating the value of an institutionalist approach to technology studies.</p>"
Lance: The Making Of The World’s Greatest Champion,['John Wilcockson'],"<p>Few people know exactly how lance Armstrong became such an amazing force in cycling. Now, in <i>Lance,</i> John Wilcockson draws on dozens of interviews with those who know Armstrong best, to trace his remarkable life, both on and off the bike.</p>
<p>Family members—including his adoptive father, speaking publicly for the first time—recall Armstrong’s humble origins, the father he barely knew, and his single mom’s struggle for survival. His childhood friends and early mentors recall how he also excelled at other sports, including swimming, running, and triathlons.</p>
<p>Known for pushing his body to the extreme and intimidating his rivals, Armstrong accomplished extraordinary feats like winning the world’s professional roadrace championship at twenty-one and taking home the Tour de France trophy seven consecutive years in a row.

The President And His Inner Circle,['Thomas Preston'],"<p>Few would argue that presidential policies and performance would have been the same whether John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon became president in 1960, or if Jimmy Carter instead of Ronald Reagan had won the White House in 1980. Indeed, in recent elections, the character, prior policy experience, or personalities of candidates have played an increasing role in our assessments of their ""fit"" for the Oval Office. Further, these same characteristics are often used to explain an administration's success or failure in policy making. Obviously, who the president is -- and what he is like -- matters.</p>
<p>This book, a new approach to the study of the personal presidency, links the characteristics of six modern American presidents -- their personalities and their prior policy-making experience -- to their leadership styles, advisory arrangements, and decision making in the White House. Thomas Preston uses M. G. Hermann's Personality Assessment-at-a-Distance (PAD) profiling technique, as well as exhaustive archival research and interviews with former advisors, to develop a leadership style typology. He then compares his model's expectations against the actual policy record of six past presidents, using foreign policy episodes: Korea (1950) for Truman, Dien Bien Phu (1954) for Eisenhower, Cuba (1962) for Kennedy, Vietnam (1967-68) for Johnson, the Gulf War (1990-91) for Bush, and North Korea/Haiti/Bosnia (1994-95) for Clinton.</p>

Fictions Of U.s. History: A Theory And Four Illustrations,['Frances Richardson Keller'],"<p>Fictions of History offers a new definition of the term ""fictions."" A fiction is not merely the imaginative literature we treasure in works of novelists, dramatists, and poets. It is a powerful, driving idea that enters the life of an individual, the course a whole society travels, and the stories historians tell about the human past. In many dimensions, fictions affect every person on planet Earth. We all live lives based on fictions.</p>
<p>Frances Richardson Keller chooses fascinating examples to demonstrate how dominant fictions of a given time emerge and are entrenched, and how historical figures have come to accept or reject these fictions. She begins with ""the grandest fiction,"" the patriarchal system, and reflects on its origins, effects, and future. Then she addresses the fictions that dominated stories historians told about the Reconstruction of America after the Civil War. Keller next considers the emergence and demise of Mormon polygamy as a fiction in the 19th century. Her fourth and last illustration is the life of Eleanor Roosevelt and the fictions that empowered her.</p>"
Mapping Careers With Ld And Add Clients,['Raizi Abby Janus'],"<p>Fifteen percent or more of the population have learning disabilities (LD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), or both. These individuals, who are often perceived by career counselors and employers as frustrating or difficult, are uniquely vulnerable in a competitive job market. Because LD and ADD individuals have ""invisible handicaps,"" their job performance and social behaviors can be interpreted incorrectly. As a consequence, problems arise that could be avoided. <i>Mapping Careers with LD and ADD Clients</i> is a user-friendly guidebook for career counselors and employers to help them deal productively with LD/ADD adults. For this reason, the book is useful as a supplementary text for graduate courses in career counseling.</p>
<p>Raizi Abby Janus synthesizes the two fields of LD/ADD diagnosis and career assessment into a comprehensive methodology. She provides the necessary background knowledge to enable social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, guidance counselors, and human resources personnel to</p>
<p>• Recognize when an employee or client has a learning disability.</p>
<p>• Provide relevant guidance to these individuals.</p>
<p>• Optimize their job performance and productivity.</p>
<p>• Help clients attain a clarified sense of identity.</p>
<p>• Know when to refer clients to other professionals for further evaluation.</p>
<p>• Be able to suggest reasonable accommodations on the job in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>For employers and career counselors, rich anecdotal insights give the feel and look of the LD and ADD syndromes in daily life and at work. For researchers in the field of adult LD and ADD, the case studies in <i>Mapping Careers</i> make a major contribution by providing</p>
<p>• Thorough psychometric documentation of the cognitive, emotional, and personality profiles of adult LD and ADD individuals.</p>
<p>• Commonly encountered profiles, as well as those of a more complex nature.</p>
<p>Janus addresses the pitfalls of indiscriminately using normative tests of intellectual and personality functions, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, 16 PF, and MMPI-2. She emphasizes the ways in which the application of normative methodologies to the LD/ADD client can be useless, misleading, or counterproductive. She also provides a useful methodology for interpreting these tests tailored to LD/ADD needs.</p>
<p>Janus has crystallized twenty years of experience in career counseling. In assessing a variety of clients, she has identified and worked with those whose LD/ADD is the source of their difficulties, as distinct from other causes.</p>

Friedman is willing to share it-but there is a but. In pursuing this prize, Gantz enters a world of strange human relationships filled with doubts and surprises. A vibrant cast of characters adds dimension to this gripping story in which Jewish folklore, music, and history coalesce.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weekend in Mustara unfolds on the fictional island of Mustara in southern Europe, a mountainous, totalitarian country that tolerates Judaism. Its few Jews cling to their heritage, embodied in their beautiful but sparsely attended synagogue and their museum, where a great memorial book is inscribed with the names of all Mustara Jews martyred during World War II. A scholar of medieval Hebrew manuscripts comes to the island, searching for traces of Yehuda Halevi, the great Hebrew poet of the Spanish Golden Age. He is soon enmeshed among elusive personalities and tangled loyalties, but only when he finds himself displaced in time-in a kind of theater of the absurd-are the purposes of his journey finally realized.</p>"

Fires All Around The Horizon: The U.n.'s Uphill Battle To Preserve The Peace,['Max Harrelson'],"<p>Fires All Around the Horizon reports on the performance of the United Nations as a peacekeeping agency during its first four decades--its successes, failures, and limitations. Written by an award-winning diplomatic correspondent who frequently observed the conflicts and discussions generated in the United Nations first-hand, this volume describes and analyzes more than 30 conflicts, from Palestine and Korea through the Falkland Islands and Grenada. For each, the author examines the origin of the conflict, who was responsible, and what role, if any, the United Nations played in restoring and maintaining peace. Written with a keen eye for detail and political nuance, this fascinating book offers the reader a well-grounded awareness not only of the United Nation's peacekeeping efforts, but also of the major international conflicts of our time. In addition to describing the conflicts themselves, Harrelson interweaves discussions of the critical issues these conflicts raised -- the Cold War, the location of the United Nations, decolonization, the United Nations in transition, the seating of Red China, the battle with South Africa. He shows that the United Nations has enjoyed some measure of success in its peacekeeping function, but has often been ineffective -- primarily due to the readiness of member nations to resort to force to settle disputes. By providing a broad historical perspective of the United Nation's peacekeeping efforts, Harrelson enables the student of international politics to form a more realistic picture of what can be expected of that organization as a peacekeeping force in the future.</p>"

Ethnic Americans: A History Of Immigration,"['Dinnerstein, Leonard']","<p>First published in 1977, <i>Ethnic Americans</i> has established itself as the classic study of immigration to the United States in the twentieth century. This updated edition reflects developments of the 1980s and '90s -- a period that has seen the greatest wave of immigration in American history. The burgeoning trend of increasing immigration, mostly from Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean, is expected to continue. But how welcome will all these people be, and what is the history of the melting (sometimes boiling) pot they are pouring into?</p>
<p>In investigating these questions, <i>Ethnic Americans</i> provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of immigration and assimilation of European, Asian, and Latin American peoples from 1607 to the present. The fourth edition has been revised and expanded to incorporate new research on women immigrants, the new refugees, and the continuing asylum crisis of the 1990s. Dinnerstein and Reimers also examine the continuity of nativism and restrictionist sentiment in the United States, as shown in the movements to make English the official language of the nation and in attempts to end bilingual education and ballots.</p>"

In 1965, Hamada works as a clerk at a conservative university, his war resistance a dark secret of the past that present-day events force into the light, confronting him with unexpected consequences of his refusal to conform twenty years earlier.</p>

The Road From Rio: Sustainable Development And The Nongovernmental Movement In The Third World,['Julie Fisher'],"<p>Fisher expertly describes and analyzes the growing non-governmental movement throughout the Third World in relation to the global issue of sustainable development, highlighted by the recent Rio Conference. An estimated 200,000 or more indigenous NGOs (non-governmental organizations) at both the grassroots and intermediary levels help fill the void created by the failure of governments to adequately address the escalating, intertwined crises of poverty, environmental degradation, and population. NGOs, a number of which Fisher examines in detail, address the myriad problems associated with dire poverty, environmental destruction, pervasive unemployment, and the grinding exploitation of women. The stimulus to action and group effort is typically the basic need for life's fundamentals--food, shelter, and safety. Fisher points out, however, that NGOs focusing on population have grown less rapidly than those concentrating on enterprise development and/or environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Fisher identifies the core abilities within and among NGOs that help them develop effective short-term strategies and also enhance their institutional sustainability in the long run. She demonstrates that this grassroots movement is a vital, growing force in the vast majority of Third World countries, with the potential to undermine the politics of repression and inequality. The international importance of NGOs is increasingly evident, given their ability to network and support one another. Fisher offers a comprehensive, insightful, and substantive assessment of what may be the most hopeful institutional resource available for the sustainable development of the Third World and, therefore, our ultimate survival as a species.</p>"
Fatal Attachments: The Instigation to Suicide,['Viola Mecke'],"<p>Five-year-old Tommy killed himself at home, where he lived with parents who said he was unwanted and deficient. College student Jennifer committed suicide by swallowing a huge mixture of pills at a motel, miles from the house where she lived with an imposing, unemotional mother who'd long thought the girl a burden. Bob, a father of two and computer company manager, might have survived his attempt at suicide, but his wife did not call 911 for 10 minutes after she found him in his running car in the garage, so he died on the way to the hospital. All of these cases described in detail by author Mecke share a factor aside from the fatality. Each person was clearly motivated by an instigator: someone who provoked the suicide. Instigators create a crushing relationship with a potentially suicidal person that, as Mecke puts it, becomes a fatal attachment. Mecke, with more than 40 years experience as clinical psychologist, believes instigators are responsible in a significant number of the more than 30,000 suicides that occur in the United States each year. Through vivid and compelling text, we understand the minds of suicide victims and their instigators, and also learn how early trauma associated with death or abandonment can make one become an instigator. Finally, Mecke shows us how we can intervene to try and break the instigator's grip, to foil the attachment. As she explains one of her primary points, relating to both the suicidal and their instigators, is that children require careful nurturing especially during their early lives. And the bent their personalities take following a trauma places responsibility upon us all to watch, to explain, to care for them.</p><p>In addition to tragic stories drawn from her practice, Mecke also describes the instigators in larger scale suicides and those of historical figures-from the cult suicide of hundreds moved by Jim Jones at Jamestown, and the suicide bombings motivated by Osama bin Laden, to the suicide of poet Sylvia Plath and the person who precipitated her death. Classical literature and Greek mythology is also used extensively to address the issue of what triggers suicide. The insights apply universally. This is a must-read for clinicians, counselors, and anyone interested in knowing about suicide and its causes.</p>"
"If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?: A Guide To Investing Fundamentals",['Ben S. Branch'],"<p>Football is often described as a game of inches. First downs, scoring, and in/out of bound decisions that can determine the outcome of the game may even come down to fractions of an inch. Investing is similar: the difference between outperforming or underperforming the market may be a few fractions of a percentage point. As Ben Branch succinctly states, successful investing, defined as outperforming the market averages, is not easy. And yet it is very much a game worth playing, particularly if you win. The key to being on the winning side is to understand the fundamental principles of investing—what it is and how it works—before making any decision. In this highly practical, non-technical guide, Branch introduces the reader to stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, real estate, futures, and all of the other basic elements of the market. He debunks popular myths and misconceptions about investing and shows you how to avoid mistakes in order to invest wisely. An extensive glossary, definitions and examples, and lists of dos and don'ts will make this book a handy resource for the novice as well as for seasoned investors looking to take their game to the next level.</p>
<p>In this highly practical, non-technical guide, Branch provides the building blocks of a multi-dimensional investing approach. First, he reviews the principle of compound interest, the foundation of all investment strategy and performance. Then, arguing that successful investing is a function of three types of activities—selection, timing, and execution—he introduces the reader to stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, real estate, futures, and all of the other elements of the market. In addition to covering well-known investments in detail, he explains lesser-known opportunities, such as bankruptcies and takeovers. Special topics include the effects of macroeconomic trends and the subtleties of timing for maximum advantage. He debunks popular myths and misconceptions about investing and shows you how to avoid mistakes in order to invest wisely. An extensive glossary, definitions and examples, and lists of dos and don'ts will make this book a handy resource for the novice, as well as for seasoned investors looking to take their game to the next level.</p>"
"An American Theatre: The Story Of Westport Country Playhouse, 1931-2005",['Richard Somerset-ward'],"<p>For 75 years, Westport Country Playhouse has faithfully reflected the story of American theatre. Founded by Lawrence and Armina Langner in 1931, it has never been more than a summer stock theatre, yet it has an astonishing pedigree. George Bernard Shaw and Noël Coward gave world premieres there; so did Leonard Gershe and A. R. Gurney in more recent times. Playwrights Eugene O’Neill and S. N. Behrman were closely linked to it, and talents as diverse as Jane Wyatt, Gene Kelly, Stephen Sondheim, and Liza Minnelli performed there early in their careers. The aristocracy of the acting profession and the giants of Hollywood appeared—Ethel Barrymore, Helen Hayes, Paul Robeson, Groucho Marx, Tyrone Power, Olivia de Havilland. And the Playhouse can claim a role in the creation of two of the American theatre’s greatest musicals—<i>Oklahoma!</i> and <i>My Fair Lady.</i></p>
<p>This fascinating and lavishly illustrated book traces the entire story of Westport Country Playhouse from its beginnings in the midst of the Depression to its 75th-anniversary renovations and rejuvenation. Filled with colorful characters and lively anecdotes, it is a story that will appeal to everyone who has ever been enchanted by the magic of a live theatre performance.</p>"
Movies And The Moral Adventure Of Life (boston Review Books),['Alan A. Stone'],"<p>For Alan Stone, a one-time Freudian analyst and former president of the American Psychiatric Society, movies are the great modern, democratic medium for exploring our individual and collective lives. They provide occasions for reflecting on what he calls ""the moral adventure of life"": the choices people make—beyond the limits of their character and circumstances—in response to life's challenges. The quality of these choices is, for him, the measure of a life well lived. In this collection of his film essays, Stone reads films as life texts. He is engaged more by their ideas than their visual presentation, more by their power to move us than by their commercial success. Stone writes about both art films and big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. And he commands an extraordinary range of historical, literary, cultural, and scientific reference that reflects his impressive personal history: professor of law and medicine, football player at Harvard in the late1940s, director of medical training at McLean Hospital, and advisor to Attorney General Janet Reno on behavioral science. In the end, Stone's enthusiasms run particularly to films that embrace the sheer complexity of life, and in doing so enlarge our sense of human possibilities: in Antonia's Line, he sees an emotionally vivid picture of a world beyond patriarchy; in Thirteen Conversations about One Thing, the power of sheer contingency in human life; and in American Beauty, how beauty in ordinary experience draws us outside ourselves, and how beauty and justice are distinct goods, with no intrinsic connection. Other films discussed in these essays (written between 1993 and 2006 for Boston Review) include Un Coeur en Hiver, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Thirteen Days, the 1997version of Lolita, The Battle of Algiers, The Passion of the Christ, Persuasion, and Water.

<p>Stone is Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law and Psychiatry at Harvard University and a former president of the American Psychiatric Society.</p>"
Network Power: The Social Dynamics Of Globalization,['David Singh Grewal'],"<p>For all the attention globalization has received in recent years, little consensus has emerged concerning how best to understand it. For some, it is the happy product of free and rational choices; for others, it is the unfortunate outcome of impersonal forces beyond our control.&nbsp; It is in turn celebrated for the opportunities it affords and criticized for the inequalities in wealth and power it generates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Singh Grewal’s remarkable and ambitious book draws on several centuries of political and social thought to show how globalization is best understood in terms of a power inherent in social relations, which he calls <i>network power</i>. Using this framework, he demonstrates how our standards of social coordination both gain in value the more they are used and undermine the viability of alternative forms of cooperation. A wide range of examples are discussed, from the spread of English and the gold standard to the success of Microsoft and the operation of the World Trade Organization, to illustrate how global standards arise and falter. The idea of network power supplies a coherent set of terms and concepts—applicable to individuals, businesses, and countries alike—through which we can describe the processes of globalization as both free and forced.&nbsp; The result is a sophisticated and novel account of how globalization, and politics, work.</p>"
Alternate Americas: Science Fiction Film And American Culture,['M. Keith Booker'],"<p>For more than 50 years, science fiction films have been among the most important and successful products of American cinema, and are worthy of study for that reason alone. On a deeper level, the genre has reflected important themes, concerns and developments in American society, so that a history of science fiction film also serves as a cultural history of America over the past half century.</p>
<p>M. Keith Booker has selected fifteen of the most successful and innovative science fiction films of all time, and examined each of them at length—from cultural, technical and cinematic perspectives—to see where they came from and what they meant for the future of cinema and for America at large. From <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> to <i>Star Wars</i>, from <i>Blade Runner</i> to <i>The Matrix</i>, these landmark films have expressed our fears and dreams, our abilities and our deficiencies. In this deep-seeking investigation, we can all find something of ourselves that we recognize, as well as something that we've never recognized before.</p>
<p>The focus on a fairly small number of landmark films allows detailed attention to genuinely original movies, including: <i>Forbidden Planet, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Blade Runner, The Terminator, Robocop, The Abyss, Independence Day</i>, and <i>The Matrix</i>. This book is ideal for general readers interested in science fiction and film.</p>"
About Town: The New Yorker And The World It Made,['Ben Yagoda'],"<p>For more than seven decades, the <i>New Yorker</i> has been the embodiment of urban sophistication and literary accomplishment, the magazine where the best work of virtually every prose giant of the century first appeared. With all the authority and elegance such a subject demands, Yagoda tells the fascinating story of the tiny journal that grew into a literary enterprise of epic proportions. Incorporating interviews with more than fifty former and current <i>New Yorker</i> writers, including the late Joseph Mitchell, Roger Angell, the late Pauline Kael, Calvin Trillin, and Ann Beattie, Yagoda is the first author to make extensive use of the <i>New Yorker</i>'s archives. <i>About Town</i> penetrates the inner workings of the <i>New Yorker</i> as no other book has done, opening a window on a lost age.</p>"
The Columbia Guide to the Literatures of Eastern Europe Since 1945,['Harold B. Segel'],"<p>For nearly half a century, the Iron Curtain obscured from Western eyes a vital group of national and regional writers. Seen as a whole, the literatures of Eastern Europe during the second half of the twentieth century are extraordinarily rich, and in recent years many Eastern European novelists, poets, and playwrights have attracted wider attention and broader publication in the West. And yet no reference work, embracing all the countries of this region, including the former East Germany, has brought synoptic analysis to bear on these literatures -- until now.</p><p>Featuring lucid analyses of the works of Ivo Andri&amp;cacute;, Milan Kundera, Wislawa Szymborksa, Ismail Kadare, Czeslaw Milosz, Christa Wolf, Imre KertÃ©sz, and Nina Cassian, among nearly 700 others, <i>The Columbia Guide to the Literatures of Eastern Europe Since 1945</i> is an indispensable reference to the literatures of the former Soviet bloc: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the former republics of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and East Germany. Marked by geographical proximity and the shared experience of communism and its collapse, these countries are home to writers whose works have illuminated many of the critical ideas and key events of the latter half of the twentieth century.</p><p>Compiled by a leading scholar who has a working knowledge of all the languages of the region, the Guide includes an analytical overview of literary themes and trends in historical context, ranging from World War II to the disintegration of Yugoslavia; an A--Z section of almost 700 entries on those writers whose literary debuts or major literary activity came after the war, with lists of works about the authors and of works by the authors available in English translation; a general bibliography; and an author index.</p><p>The author entries -- the heart of the book -- provide the most salient information about the writers and concise interpretations of their works. The two-part general bibliography lists references to books and articles only in English. The first part contains works of a general nature on Eastern Europe, primarily but not exclusively after 1945. The second cites works, listed by country, that fall into four categories: histories, literary histories, anthologies, and monographs on genres and movements.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
Afghanistan: A Military History From Alexander The Great To The War Against The Taliban,['Stephen Tanner'],"<p>For over 2,500 years, the forbidding territory of Afghanistan has served as a vital crossroads for armies and has witnessed history-shaping clashes between civilizations: Greek, Arab, Mongol, and Tartar, and, in more recent times, British, Russian, and American. When U.S. troops entered Afghanistan in the weeks following September 11, 2001, they overthrew the Afghan Taliban regime and sent the terrorists it harbored on the run. But America’s initial easy victory is in sharp contrast to the difficulties it faces today in confronting the Taliban resurgence.</p>
<p>Originally published in 2002, Stephen Tanner’s <i>Afghanistan</i> has now been completely updated to include the crucial turn of events since America first entered the country.</p>"
American Encounters With Arabs: The Soft Power Of U.s. Public Diplomacy In The Middle East,"['Rugh, William A.']","<p>For sixty years, U.S. government officials have conducted public diplomacy programs to try to reach Arab public opinion—to inform, educate, and understand Arab attitudes. American public affairs officers have met serious challenges in the past, but Arab public criticism of the United States has reached unprecedented levels since September 11, 2001. Polls show that much of the negative opinion of the United States, especially in the Middle East, can be traced to dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy. Rugh, a retired career Foreign Service officer who twice served as ambassador to countries in the region, explains how U.S. government officials have dealt with key problem issues over the years, and he recommends ways that public diplomacy can better support and enhance U.S. national interests in the Middle East. This struggle for the hearts and minds of the Arab world, so crucial to the success of American efforts in post-occupation Iraq, is carried out through broadcasting, cultural contacts, and educational and professional exchanges.</p>
<p>Rugh describes the difference between public diplomacy and propaganda. He points out that public diplomacy uses open means of communication and is truthful. Its four main components are explaining U.S. foreign policy to foreign publics; presenting them with a fair and balanced picture of American society, culture, and institutions; promoting mutual understanding; and advising U.S. policy makers on foreign attitudes. Public diplomacy supports the traditional diplomatic functions of official business between governments. Whereas diplomats from the United States deal with diplomats of foreign governments, public affairs officers deal with opinion leaders such as media editors, reporters, academics, student leaders, and prominent intellectuals and cultural personalities. Rugh provides an up-close-and-personal look at how public affairs officers do their jobs, how they used innovation in their efforts to meet the challenges of the past, and how they continue to do so in the post-September 11 era.</p>"
Seven Deadly Sins: Settling The Argument Between Born Bad And Damaged Good,['Corey Taylor'],"<p>For the first time, Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor speaks directly to his fans and shares his worldview about life as a sinner. And Taylor knows how to sin. As a small-town hero in the early '90s, he threw himself into a fierce-drinking, drug-abusing, hard-loving, live-for-the moment life. Soon Taylor's music exploded, and he found himself rich, wanted, and on the road. His new and ever-more extreme lifestyle had an unexpected effect, however; for the first time, he began to actively think about what it meant to sin and whether sinning could--or should--be recast in a different light. <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i> is Taylor's personal story, but it's also a larger discussion of what it means to be seen as either a ""good"" person or a ""bad"" one. Yes, Corey Taylor has broken the law and hurt people, but, if sin is what makes us human, how wrong can it be?</p>"
An economic record of presidential performance: from Truman to Bush,"['Carroll, Richard J.']","<p>For the first time, trends in 20 major economic and federal budget indicators, most reported since World War II, are presented in a single source. The economic performances under each presidential administration are ranked for each indicator, as well as for their overall performance. The results are often surprising and counter-intuitive, challenging many popular beliefs. This presentation of averages, trends, and illustrations will allow scholars, students, and others interested in economics, politics, and history, to interpret economic news more effectively.</p>"
"Emotional Development, Theory And Applications: A Neo-piagetian Perspective",['Henry Dupont'],"<p>Freud's assumption that our emotions are instinctual and innate, and that they reside in our unconscious, is still the dominant notion in our conventional wisdom. If our emotions are instinctual and innate, then they have little relationship to our needs and values, and they do not change in the course of development. This book advances a contemporary theory of emotional development, a neo-Piagetian theory that postulates that both our feelings and emotions are cognitive constructions that are informed by our needs and values, and that our feelings and emotions change considerably in the course of development. Using interview and original case material, the author illustrates his theory's application to both short- and long-term psychotherapy, as well as the implications for research, assessment, emotional education, and counseling.</p>"
Journeys With Flies,"['Wilmsen, Edwin N.']","<p>From 1973 to 1994, anthropologist Edwin Wilmsen lived and worked among the Zhu, Mbanduru, and Tswana people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa. Thousands of miles from his home, immersed in what first seemed a radically different place, and operating in languages he initially did not understand, he began a record of his impressions and reflections as a complement to his scientific fieldwork. <i>Journeys with Flies</i> weaves together the multilayered experiences of his life among these Kalahari people, capturing at once the intellectual challenges an anthropologist faces in the field and the myriad and strange ways that unfamiliar experiences come to resonate with deeply personal thoughts and recollections.</p>
<p>Combining biography, poetry, and anthropology, Wilmsen vividly portrays the intense realities of life in the Kalahari and carries the reader across space and time as events in the present trigger emotions and memories. Images of apartheid, for example, evoke memories of Wilmsen's childhood in the segregated South. Poems, journal entries, and moving accounts of deepening personal relationships all intertwine as Wilmsen conveys the experiences he shares with his ""subjects"" in spite of vast differences in their backgrounds—extreme thirst under the desert sun, grief over the death of a child, and the constant irritation of ubiquitous flies.</p>
<p>""Our understanding of other peoples,"" he writes, ""lies not in themselves or in anything that they do but in our experience of them. Experience that is lived partly in their world and partly in a shell of our world that we wear when we meet them.""</p>
<p>Sophisticated, lyrical, and passionately written, <i>Journeys with Flies</i> will inspire all those who travel to places far from home.</p>"
Contingency Blues: The Search For Foundations In American Criticism,['Paul Jay'],"<p>From Emerson to Rorty, American criticism has grappled in one way or another with the problem of modernity—specifically, how to determine critical and cultural standards in a world where every position seems the product of an interpretation. Part intellectual history, part cultural critique, this provocative book is an effort to shake American thought out of the grip of the nineteenth century—and out of its contingency blues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Jay focuses his analysis on two strands of American criticism. The first, which includes Richard Poirier and Giles Gunn, has attempted to revive what Jay insists is an anachronistic pragmatism derived from Emerson, James, and Dewey. The second, represented most forcefully by Richard Rorty, tends to reduce American criticism to a metadiscourse about the contingent grounds of knowledge. In chapters on Emerson, Whitman, Santayana, Van Wyck Brooks, Dewey, and Kenneth Burke, Jay examines the historical roots of these two positions, which he argues are marked by recurrent attempts to reconcile transcendentalism and pragmatism.&nbsp; A forceful rejection of both kinds of revisionism, <i>Contingency Blues</i> locates an alternative in the work of the “border studies” critics, those who give our interest in contingency a new, more concrete form by taking a more historical, cultural, and anthropological approach to the invention of literature, subjectivity, community, and culture in a pan-American context.</p>"
The Spectator: A World War Ii Bomber Pilot's Journal Of The Artist As Warrior,['David Zellmer'],"<p>From Greenwich Village to Guadalcanal in just over a year, David Zellmer would find piloting a B-24 bomber in the South Pacific a far cry from his life as a fledgling member of the Martha Graham Dance Company. He soon discovered the unimagined thrills of first flights and the astonishment of learning that an aerial spin was merely a vertical pirouette which one spotted on a barn thousands of feet below, instead of on a doorknob in Martha's studio. Reconstructed from letters home, this captivating account traces Zellmer's journey from New York to the islands of the South Pacific as the 13th Air Force battled to push back the Japanese invaders in 1943 and 1944.</p>
<p>Spurred to action by encouraging letters from Martha Graham, who urges him to document his participation in the great tragic play of the Second World War, Zellmer struggles to come to terms with the fears and joys of flying, of killing and being killed. Each stage of the battle takes him farther and farther from those he loves, until the soft night breezes and moon-splashed surf no longer work their magic. From bombing runs against Truk, the infamous headquarters of the Japanese Fleet, to much savored slivers of civilization in Auckland and Sydney, the young pilot bemoans a gnawing concern at a loss of sensation, the prospect of life—not as a performer, but as a spectator. With distant memories of life on the stage, he finds that only the threat of death can bring the same intensity of feeling.</p>"
A Passion To Preserve: Gay Men As Keepers Of Culture,['Will Fellows'],"<p>From large cities to rural communities, gay men have long been impassioned pioneers as keepers of culture: rescuing and restoring decrepit buildings, revitalizing blighted neighborhoods, saving artifacts and documents of historical significance. <i>A Passion to Preserve</i> explores this authentic and complex dimension of gay men’s lives by profiling early and contemporary preservationists from throughout the United States, highlighting contributions to the larger culture that gays are exceptionally inclined to make.</p>"

<p>Even before Robert Flaherty released <cite>Nanook of the North</cite> in 1922, anthropologists were producing films about the lifeways of native peoples for a public audience, as well as for research and teaching. <cite>Ethnographic Film</cite> (1976) was one of the first books to provide a comprehensive introduction to this field of visual anthropology, and it quickly became the standard reference.</p>
<p>In this new edition, Karl G. Heider thoroughly updates <cite>Ethnographic Film</cite> to reflect developments in the field over the three decades since its publication, focusing on the work of four seminal filmmakers—Jean Rouch, John Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Timothy Asch. He begins with an introduction to ethnographic film and a history of the medium. He then considers many attributes of ethnographic film, including the crucial need to present ""whole acts,"" ""whole bodies,"" ""whole interactions,"" and ""whole people"" to preserve the integrity of the cultural context. Heider also discusses numerous aspects of making ethnographic films, from ethics and finances to technical considerations such as film versusvideo and preserving the filmed record. He concludes with a look at using ethnographic film in teaching.</p>"
Designing Modern America: Broadway to Main Street,"['Christopher Innes', 'C. D. Innes']","<p>From the 1920s through the 1950s, two individuals, Joseph Urban and Norman Bel Geddes, did more, by far, to create the image of 'America' and make it synonymous with modernity than any of their contemporaries. Urban and Bel Geddes were leading Broadway stage designers and directors who turned their prodigious talents to other projects, becoming mavericks first in industrial design and then in commercial design, fashion, architecture, and more. The two men gave shape to the most quintessential symbols of the modern American lifestyle, including movies, cars, department stores, and nightclubs, along with private homes, kitchens, stoves, fridges, magazines, and numerous household furnishings.</p><p>Illustrated with more than 130 photographs of their influential designs, this book tells the engrossing story of Urban and Bel Geddes. Christopher Innes shows how these two men with a background in theater lent dramatic flair to everything they designed and how this theatricality gave the distinctive modernity they created such wide appeal. If the American lifestyle has been much imitated across the globe over the past fifty years, says Innes, it is due in large measure to the designs of Urban and Bel Geddes. Together they were responsible for creating what has been called the 'Golden Age' of American culture.</p>"
Dazzler: The Life And Times Of Moss Hart,['Steven Bach'],"<p>From the Algonquin Round Table to the Gershwins and the Hollywood moguls, Moss Hart knew and delighted everybody. <i>Vanity</i> Fair has called him ""one of American theater's greatest geniuses,"" the man responsible for such indelible successes as <i>A Star Is Born</i>, <i>Camelot</i>, and <i>My Fair Lady</i>.

But it ended at the beginning—when Hart was only twenty-five. Now, at last, we have the whole and far richer story in this first full-scale biography of ""the Prince of Broadway."" Here Steven Bach explores the private Moss Hart, revealing his struggles with self-doubt, depression, and sexual identity, and the public one, recounting his creativity and charisma, his wit and grace. With thorough research and graceful prose, Steven Bach takes us on a journey to another time and place, where one man created a dazzling world for himself and for all American theatergoers.</p>"
The Thinkers 50: The World's Most Influential Business Writers And Leaders,['Stuart Crainer'],"<p>From the distinguished Charles Handy to the classic Philip Kotler to the outspoken Paul Krugman, and including such visionary leaders as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, <i>The Thinkers 50</i>, based on an international survey of business academics, practitioners, consultants, and journalists, reinforces the powerful influences business and popular culture have on each other. Following surveys that were conducted in 2001 and 2003 (asking the single question: Who is the most important living management thinker?), the 2005 survey is the first to be released with a companion book, applying such criteria as practicality of ideas and international outlook to determine ranking, and featuring colorful, informative, and concise profiles of the 50 individuals whose ideas most profoundly influence business today. Each profile includes information on the subject's background and primary contributions, and lists key publications and web sites. Collectively, they reflect the state of the art in contemporary management thinking and its application, separating the people and ideas with lasting impact from the passing fads. From students to entrepreneurs to seasoned executives, <i>The Thinkers 50</i> provides a compendium of practical insights on the art and science of management.</p>"
"Fortress America: The Forts That Defended America, 1600 To The Present","['Kaufmann, J. E.']","<p>From the earliest colonial settlements to recent Cold War bunkers, the North American continent has been home to thousands of forts and fortress structures. Seacoast forts were the nation's primary means of strategic defense from the 1790s until World War II. Almost every seaport on both coasts had at least one fort to protect it at one time or another. Inland forts were built to defend against attacks by Native Americans, or to defend against the English, the French, or the Spanish. So many forts were built-most in the 1800s-that there are few places in the continental United States more than fifty miles from a fort location. Yet, despite their prominence and importance, there has never been-until now-a single volume devoted to American forts and homeland fortification defense.As in their previous and very successful books, experts J. E. and H. W. Kaufmann include never-before-published photographs, extraordinary drawings, cut-aways, and diagrams to illustrate <i>Fortress America</i>.</p>"
The Native Peoples Of North America [2 Volumes]: A History (native America: Yesterday And Today (hardcover)),['Bruce E. Johansen'],"<p>From the earliest traces of first arrivals to the present, the Native peoples of North America represent a diverse and colorful array of cultures. From Central America to Canada, from recent archaeological discoveries to accounts of current controversies, this comprehensive study uses both traditional story telling and a powerful narrative to bring history to life. Johansen provides a critical narrative of European-American westward expansion through use of Native American voices, including compelling personal sketches of key figures such as: Tecumseh, alliance builder in the Ohio Valley; Chief Joseph the Younger, leader of the Nez Perce long march; and Susette LaFlesche, an Omaha Indian who reported on the Wounded Knee massacre for the <i>Omaha-Herald</i>.</p>
<p>This account provides an uncommonly rich description of the material and intellectual ways in which Native American cultures have influenced the life and institutions of people across the globe, from medicine such as aspirin to foods like corn and squash to democratic ideas. It utilizes portrayals of select incidents, such as the Wounded Knee massacre and the impact of small pox, to reveal deep layers of meaning about the frontier experience in American history. A wide array of contemporary controversies, such as gambling interests, sports mascots, and sovereignty issues, are also included.</p>"
"August Von Kotzebue: The Comedy, The Man",['Oscar Mandel'],"<p>From the year 1788, when he triumphed on the Berlin stage with his <em>Misanthropy and Remorse</em>, to 1819, when a student terrorist stabbed him to death for his ""unpatriotic"" political views, Kotzebue reigned supreme over the German and Austrian theater, and pervaded theaters throughout the world. Goethe, who both admired and despised the Weimar-born writer, produced his plays more often than those of any other author, living or dead. Some fifty of his plays were eagerly translated and performed in Great Britain and the United States. His influence on nineteenth-century stagecraft was far-reaching.</p>
<p>Today he is still a familiar figure to every student of German literature and history. In the English-speaking world, however, the erstwhile darling of the theater has been practically forgotten. The critical literature about him in our language is negligible. But this void is now ideally filled by Mandel's volume. He has translated into fluent, performable English (with very useful notes) the comedy that is generally regarded as Kotzebue's masterpiece. In addition, the first half of his book is devoted to a thoroughgoing critical and biographical introduction.</p>
<p>Without seeking to rehabilitate Kotzebue's vast output in the sentimental and melodramatic genres, Mandel argues that he created the final important neoclassical comedy in a long-lived tradition extending from Machiavelli through Moliere, Goldoni, Sheridan, and ending, on a note of anti-Romantic bravado, with himself. Mandel supports his argument with the most tangible evidence: the droll play itself.</p>"
Games Of Chicken: Four Decades Of U.s. Nuclear Policy,"['Schwartzman, David.']","<p>Games of Chicken proposes basing nuclear weapons policies on both historical and analytical arguments. Schwartzman analyzes the trade-off between the aggression risk, which U.S. policy has sought to minimize, and the pre-emption risk, which has been ignored. This analysis is then applied to policy developments under each of the post-war U.S. presidents. The historical analysis also demonstrates the importance of the role of myths in the development of policy, most notably: the myth of the nuclear strategy expert; the ""evil empire"" myth; and the economic necessity myth. Finally, the author proposes a viable solution to the increasing build-up of nuclear weapons, one which would minimize the preemption risk.</p>"
"Gateways To Knowledge: The Role Of Academic Libraries In Teaching, Learning, And Research","['Dowler', 'Lawrence']","<p>Gateways to Knowledge is about change, about suspending old ideas without rejecting them and rethinking the purpose of the university and the library. Proponents of the gateway concept— which ties together these fifteen essays by scholars, librarians, and academic administrators —envision the library as a point of access to other library and research resources, and electronically beyond; as a place for teaching; and as a site for services and support where students and faculty can locate and use the information they need in the form in which they need it.Struggling to define the library of the future, librarians have too often bolted new technology,programs, and services on to existing library functions. These essays focus instead on how information may be packaged and disseminated in a networked environment, as well as on how to think about the nature and qualities of electronic information.There are discussions of specific gateway projects such as the Mann Library at Cornell, the new gateway library at the University of Southern California, the Information Arcade at the University of Iowa, and of ""Who Built America?"" — one of the most interesting new educational software packages currently available.Contributors : Anthony Appiah (Harvard University).

Solzhenitsyn,['Georg Lukacs'],"<p>Georg Lukac's most recent work of literary criticism, on the Nobel Prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn, hails the Russian author as a major force in redirecting socialist realism toward the level it once occupied in the 1920s when Soviet writers portrayed the turbulent transition to socialist society.In the first essay Lukacs compares the novella One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich to short pieces by bourgeois writers Conrad and Hemingway and explains the nature of Solzhenitsyn's criticism of the Stalinist period implied in the situation, characters, and their interaction. He also briefly describes Matriona's House, An Incident at the Kretchetovka Station, and For the Good of the Cause - stories that depict various aspects of life in Stalinist Russia.In the second, longer section, Lukacs greets Solzhenitsyn's novels The First Circle and Cancer Ward, which were published outside Russia, as representing a new high point in contemporary world literature. These books mark Solzhenitsyn as heir to the best tendencies in postrevolutionary socialist realism and to the literary tradition of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Moreover, from the point of view of the development of the novel, Lukacs finds the Russian author to be a successful exponent of innovative methods originating in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain.The central problem of contemporary socialist realism is a predominant theme in the book: how to come to critical terms with the legacy of Stalin. The enthusiasm with which Lukacs acclaims Solzhenitsyn will not surprise those who have followed his persistent refusal to endorse the so-called socialist realist writers of the Stalinist era. He outlines the aspects of Solzhenitsyn's creative method that allows him to cross the ideological boudaries of the Stalinist tradition, yet he finds a basic pessimism in Solzhenitsyn's work that makes him a plebeian rather than a socialist writer.Of Ivan Denisovich and the future of socialist realist literature, Lukacs urges: If socialist writers were to reflect upon their task, if they were again to feel an artistic responsibiliity towards the great problems of the present, powerful forces could be unleashed leading in the direction of relevant socialist literature. In this process of transformation and renewal, which signifies an abrupt departure from the socialist realism of the Stalin era, the role of landmark on the road to the future falls to Solzhenitsyn's story.</p>"
Latinos In A Changing Society,"['Martha Montero-sieburth', 'Edwin Meléndez']","<p>Given the importance of Latino issues in the current social and economic times, the publication of <i>Latinos in a Changing Society</i> is both timely and prescient in its contributions to the current discourse of how Latinos are being influenced by U.S. norms and culture and how Latinos are also affecting U.S. society. This volume contributes to our need for comprehensive analysis of how Latin communities compare and contrast with other underserved groups. It also examines how changes are taking place within specific Latino groups particularly between first and second generation Cubans, returning Puerto Ricans, Dominican poverty, and emergent Mexican leaders in the New England area. The opportunities that Latinos and dominant mainstream interests share are identified in this volume, but so are the many areas in need of change.</p>
<p>In this current atmosphere of anger and suspicion toward immigrants, this volume presents an analytical perspective that is too often absent from politically motivated debates about Latinos and their role in a changing society. Undocumented immigrants are often portrayed as people who come to this country to take advantage of a generous welfare system contributing little to the economic and social development of the country. This volume critically examines issues such as the Latino commitment to labor participation, the ways that Latino parents engage in schools and in their communities, health access and social programs, the policing concerns within the Latino community, the academic adjustments made by Latino college students as well as the educational opportunities that exist for Latinos across the country. Unlike publications that seek to summarize knowledge about the Latino population in the United States, <i>Latinos in a Changing Society</i> provides a broader range of insights into the types of policy analysis, research, and public consciousness needed to advance the educational, social, cultural, and political participation and incorporation of Latinos in the new century. This volume critically examines such issues as the disparity in poverty among Latino groups, the lack of access to health services, the Latino commitment to labor participation, the ways that Latino parents engage in schools and in their communities, and the educational dropout rates of Latinos across the country and the underlying causes of those rates. Unlike publications that seek to summarize knowledge about the Latino population in the United States, <i>Latinos in a Changing Society</i> provides a broader range of insights into the types of policy analysis, research, and public consciousness needed to advance the educational, social, cultural, and political participation and incorporation of Latinos in the new century.</p>"
Global Warming: The Truth Behind The Myth,['Michael L. Parsons'],"<p>Global Warming: The Truth behind the Myth is a provocative discussion of the relationship between global climate and the greenhouse effect. Dr. Michael Parsons, an esteemed scientist and writer in the area of atomic spectroscopy and environmental analysis, uses the term ""myth"" to capture the essence of the misunderstanding and exaggeration behind the popular view of global warming. The author explains the computer models that are used to predict climate change, points out their flaws, and offers insight into the views and opinions of the computer modelers themselves. While there is no question that the greenhouse phenomenon exists, there are many uncertainties about computer predictions and the assumptions used in the computer models. Important factors such as solar variation, El Nino, cloud dynamics, and ocean currents significantly influence the earth's climate, and yet most computer models have neglected to adequately incorporate them. Global Warming is not an anti-environmental book. Rather, it is an authoritative attempt to put the facts associated with global climate into proper perspective along with other environmental problems, such as overpopulation, depletion of nonrenewable energy resources, and pollution. Dr. Parsons presents the scientific facts on both sides of the various issues and documents them so that the reader will be able to come to an intelligent, unbiased opinion. Written primarily for the general public, this intriguing book will also be enlightening for teachers and students, politicians, agricultural economists, environmental engineers and geologists, climatologists, conservationists, public health officials, policymakers, and scientists in general.</p>"
The First Look,"['Davis, Amelia , 1968-']","<p>Grappling head-on with America's ""hidden killer,"" <i>The First Look</i> presents direct statements from breast cancer survivors together with photographs of their postsurgery bodies. This powerful volume counters the fear of the unknown by providing concrete information on what breast cancer survival looks and feels like.</p>
<p>Amelia Davis's bold photographs equip those facing surgery with real information on what to expect, on reconstructive options, and on lymphedema, a frequent result of mastectomy. This essential book also provides companions-in-arms for newcomers to the battle against cancer. Behind each photograph, behind each story is a woman who triumphed. Their ""battle wounds"" serve as reminders of the resilience of the female spirit and as symbols of survival, perseverance, and strength.</p>
<p>A diverse portrait of renewal, regeneration, and most of all reality, <i>The First Look</i> presents mothers, grandmothers, wives, and daughters ranging in age from twenty-five to seventy-six. Some have undergone reconstructive surgery or been fitted with prostheses; some have not. All have struggled with cancer's wide-ranging impact on their bodies, their relationships, and their daily lives.</p>
<p>""Posing for this book . . . is sort of like 'coming out,'"" a twenty-eight-year-old subject of this book reports. By taking a stand to make breast cancer visible rather than hidden, <i>The First Look</i> affirms the human body as an art form, not only as it was created, but also as it is reshaped in the course of a life.</p>"
Allies For Armageddon: The Rise Of Christian Zionism,['Victoria Clark'],"<p>Guided by a literal reading of the prophetic sections of the Bible, Christian Zionists are convinced that the world is hurtling toward a final Battle of Armageddon. They believe that war in the Middle East is God’s will for the region. In this timely book, Victoria Clark first explores the 400-year history of this powerful political ideology, laying to rest the idea that Christian Zionism is a passing craze or the province of a lunatic fringe. Then Clark surveys the contemporary Christian Zionist scene in Israel and in the United States, where the influence of the religious fundamentalists has never been greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clark engages with Christian Zionism directly, interviewing leaders, attending events, and traveling with Christian Zionists in the Holy Land. She also investigates the Christian Zionist presence in Israel. She finds that the view through the Christian Zionist lens is dangerously simple: President Bush’s War on Terror is a mythic battle between good and evil, and Syria and Iran represent the powers of darkness. Such views are far from rare—an estimated fifteen to twenty million Americans share them. Almost one in three Americans believes Israel was given to the Jews by God as a prelude to the Battle of Armageddon and Jesus’ Second Coming. Clark concludes with an assessment of Christian Zionists’ impact on American foreign policy in the Middle East and on America’s relationships with European allies since the attacks of 9/11.</p>"

John Quincy Adams,['Harlow Giles Unger'],"<p>He fought for Washington, served with Lincoln, witnessed Bunker Hill, and sounded the clarion against slavery on the eve of the Civil War. He negotiated an end to the War of 1812, engineered the annexation of Florida, and won the Supreme Court decision that freed the African captives of <i>The Amistad</i>. He served his nation as minister to six countries, secretary of state, senator, congressman, and president.</p><p>John Quincy Adams was all of these things and more. In this masterful biography, award winning author Harlow Giles Unger reveals Quincy Adams as a towering figure in the nationâs formative years and one of the most courageous figures in American history, which is why he ranked first in John F.

Man Of The Century: Winston Churchill And His Legend Since 1945,['John Ramsden'],"<p>He is commemorated throughout the world in museums and statuary, on street signs and in gift shops; even more prominently, Winston Churchill's monumental presence persists in shelves upon shelves of biographies and histories, dozens of which were written by Churchill himself and have been international bestsellers. While political figures are routinely the objects of intense posthumous scrutiny, few have achieved such pervasive and ongoing influence, and fewer still have so adeptly orchestrated their own place in history. <i>Man of the Century</i> is the often surprising story of how Winston Churchill, in the last years of his life, carefully crafted his reputation for posterity, and it reveals him as the twentieth century's pioneering, and perhaps most gifted, ""spin doctor."" It is also a far-ranging account not only of Churchill's continuing impact on British, American, and European politics, but also of the powerful legacy of his vision of a common destiny and heritage for English-speaking peoples around the world.</p>
<p>In the first book to examine the full scope of Churchill's postwar influence, John Ramsden draws on fresh material and extensive research from three continents to argue that the statesman's force of personality and romantic, imperial notion of Britain have contributed directly to many political events of the last several decades -- including American involvement in Vietnam and the role of the Anglo-American alliance in promoting and protecting a certain vision of world order. <i>Man of the Century</i> captures the complexities of Churchill's story and political legacy as well as the spirit and irreverent power of the statesman who became a modern legend.</p>

Are My Blinkers Showing?: Adventures In Filmmaking In The New Russia,['Michael York'],"<p>He was the raging, youthful Tybalt in Franco Zeffirelli's classic film <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. He was a divinely decadent foil to Liza Minnelli's divinely decadent Sally Bowles in Bob Fosse's Oscar-winning Cabaret. And he won over an entirely new generation in the Austin Powers movies. Now Michael York is off to make the biggest independent film in Russian history-in the capitalist Wild Wild West that is today's Russia. York is co-starring alongside the 300-pound, 6-foot-6-inch Russian bodybuilder Alexander Nevsky (think Arnold Schwarzenegger) in an action film called <i>Moscow Heat</i>. With a self-deprecating wit reminiscent of Charles Grodin in <i>It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here</i>, an eye trained on the imponderables of day-to-day life (especially in faraway places-what on earth did the hotel's laundry list mean by the mysterious men's garment it called ""blinkers""?), and with an increasingly alarmed sense of how the new Russia, for all its capitalist trappings, is becoming ever more like the old Russia under an ever more autocratic government, Michael York has crafted a deliciously readable insider's account that transcends genre. There's much here to be found about the actor's craft, much to be found about Russia then and now-but most of all there is the singular pleasure of being in the company of a witty and delightfully articulate observer of people, places, and the remarkable adventure called moviemaking.</p>"
The Eye Of Prey: Subversions Of The Postmodern (theories Of Contemporary Culture),['Herbert Blau'],"<p>Herbert Blau here reflects on performance as it moved from the theatricalized activism of the sixties into the theoretical activism of the eighties. The essays theorize rather than formulate an ideological program. Blau takes risks at the speculative edge of thought. The Eye of Prey is comprised of diverse subject matter: love and mourning, play and aging, radical feminist and homosexual discourse, the politics of representation, comedy since the Absurd, Barthes and Beckett, Beckett and Derrida — a critique of certain aspects of postmodern thought and performance, and in particular the ideological program of ""the subject of desire.""</p>"

Zin: The History And Mystery Of Zinfandel,['David Darlington'],"<p>Here is the book that Frank J. Prial in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> called ""delightfulit weaves history, geography, wine, and some of the fascinating people who make it into a downright enthralling tale."" It is the grape that has been stepped on, but never crushed. Long thought to produce workaday wines at best, the zinfandel grape has triumphed in the last decade, with stylish, sophisticated wines from the Ravenswood and Ridge wineries, among many others. In <i>Zin,</i> David Darlington delves into the murky and curious history of the wine and takes the story right up to the present, with portraits of the eccentric artisans who engineered the ascension of America's ""native"" wine. With an unerring eye for detail (a bedraggled vineyard in Sonoma County is described as looking ""like a collection of fright wigs"") and a gift for the on-target characterization (Sutter Home, for example, is called ""the Sylvester Stallone among wineries""), Darlington has created a classic transcending its genre.</p>"
Hearst Over Hollywood,['Louis Pizzitola'],"<p>Hollywood -- crossroads of filmmaking, mythmaking, and politics -- was dominated by one man more than any other for most of its history. It was William Randolph Hearst who understood how to use cinema to exploit the public's desire for entertainment and to create film propaganda to further his own desire for power. From the start, Hearst saw his future and the future of Hollywood as one and the same. He pioneered and capitalized on the synergistic relationship between yellow journalism and advertising and motion pictures. He sent movie cameramen to the inauguration of William McKinley and the front lines of the Spanish-American War. He played a prominent role in organizing film propaganda for both sides fighting World War I. By the 1910s, Hearst was producing his own pictures -- he ran one of the first animation studios and made many popular and controversial movie serials, including <i>The Perils of Pauline</i> (creating both the scenario and the catchphrase title) and <i>Patria</i>. As a feature film producer, Hearst was responsible for some of the most talked-about movies of the 1920s and 1930s. Behind the scenes in Hollywood, Hearst had few equals -- he was a much-feared power broker from the Silent Era to the Blacklisting Era.</p>
<p><i>Hearst Over Hollywood</i> draws on hundreds of previously unpublished letters and memos, FBI Freedom of Information files, and personal interviews to document the scope of Hearst's power in Hollywood. Louis Pizzitola tells the hidden story of Hearst's shaping influence on both film publicity and film censorship -- getting the word out and keeping it in check -- as well as the growth of the ""talkies,"" and the studio system. He details Hearst's anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, used to retaliate for Citizen Kane and to maintain dominance in the film industry, and exposes his secret film deal with Germany on the eve of World War II.</p>
<p>The author also presents new insights into Hearst's relationships with Marion Davies, Will Hays, Louis B. Mayer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mussolini, Hitler, and the Kennedys. <i>Hearst Over Hollywood</i> is a tour de force of biography, cultural study, and film history that reveals as never before the brilliance and darkness of Hearst's prophetic connection with Hollywood.</p>

This volume focuses on several filmmakers who have used the trope of the homosexual as monster in a way that subverts traditional cinema.

"Children's World: Growing Up In Russia, 1890-1991",['Catriona Kelly'],"<p>How a country views its children reveals a great deal about that country. This landmark history of childhood in twentieth-century Russia presents an enthralling and detailed picture of a society where childhood was celebrated everywhere but children’s real needs were often neglected by the state. Catriona Kelly, one of the foremost cultural historians of modern Russia, explores every aspect of children’s lives, including the stresses and joys of ordinary family life, friendships, sports and games, first love, clothing, and schools. She examines the experiences of children in institutions, orphanages, and Stalin’s camps, as well as the impact on their lives of such historical tragedies as revolution, civil and world war, and political purges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on unprecedented research in archives, hundreds of interviews, and the study of a huge range of newspapers, books, and pamphlets, the book has an immediacy which is startling. Over 100 illustrations sharpen the focus still more. Kelly weaves together information about the relationships between children and adults, prevailing ideas about childhood, and the actual experiences of children to create an unforgettable account of the intimate workings of Russian and Soviet society.</p>

The Intentional Stance (a Bradford Book),['Daniel C. Dennett'],"<p>How are we able to understand and anticipate each other in everyday life, in our daily interactions? Through the use of such ""folk"" concepts as belief, desire, intention, and expectation, asserts Daniel Dennett in this first full-scale presentation of a theory of intentionality that he has been developing for almost twenty years. We adopt a stance, he argues, a predictive strategy of interpretation that presupposes the rationality of the people - or other entities - we are hoping to understand and predict.These principles of radical interpretation have far-reaching implications for the metaphysical and scientific status of the processes referred to by the everday terms of folk psychology and their corresponding terms in cognitive science.While Dennett's philosophical stance has been steadfast over the years, his views have undergone successive enrichments, refinements, and extensions. The Intentional Stance brings together both previously published and original material: four of the book's ten chapters - its first and the final three - appear here for the first time and push the theory into surprising new territory. The remaining six were published earlier in the 1980s but were not easily accessible; each is followed by a reflection - an essay reconsidering and extending the claims of the earlier work. These reflections and the new chapters represent the vanguard of Dennett's thought. They reveal fresh lines of inquiry into fundamental issues in psychology, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary theory as well as traditional issues in the philosophy of mind.Daniel C. Dennett is Distinguished Arts and Sciences Professor at Tufts University and the author of Brainstorms and Elbow Room. The Intentional Stance, along with these works, is a Bradford Book.</p>"
The Voice In Cinema,['Michel Chion'],"<p>How can a voice whose source is never seen—such as Hal in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> or the mother of Norman Bates in <i>Psycho</i>—have such a powerful hold on an audience? When does ""synchronized sound"" fail to link bodies to their voices, and how do such great stylists of sound film as Jacques Tati, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Marguerite Duras deploy the power of the voice?</p>
<p>In this brilliant essay, Michel Chion, internationally cited authority on the history and poetics of film sound, examines the human voice in cinema. <i>The Voice in Cinema</i> begins with the phenomenon of film's hidden, faceless voices and their magical powers, particularly in the context of Lang's <i>Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>. Chion then explores subjective voices, bonding and entrapment by telephone, voice-thieves, screams (male and female), siren calls, and the silence of mute characters-all uniquely cinematic deployments. In conclusion, Chion considers ""the monstrous marriage of the filmed voice and body"" as embodied in Norman Bates. Claudia Gorbman's fluent translation retains Chion's sophisticated and accessible style, introducing readers to a distinct and paradigm-changing voice on film.</p>

Intentional Oil Pollution at Sea: Environmental Policy and Treaty Compliance,['Ronald B. Mitchell'],"<p>How do environmental treaties influence international behavior? Deliberate discharges from oil tankers have traditionally been the biggest source of oil pollution from ships, greater than much-publicized accidental spills. Although an international treaty governs how tankers must dispose of oil, compliance has been a problem. Intentional Oil Pollution at Sea is a detailed case study of how international environmental treaties can be made more effective. Combining theoretical analysis with a rigorous empirical evaluation of changes in the compliance process over time, it identifies policies that have increased compliance by governments and the oil transportation industry with discharge restrictions, equipment requirements, enforcement, and reporting.Ronald Mitchell introduces the debate over environmental treaty compliance, compliance theory, and a history of intentional oil pollution. He then uses a wealth of data to study efforts to change government and industry behavior in reporting on treaty performance, enforcing rules, and complying with equipment and discharge standards. He closes with theoretical conclusions drawn from the empirical analysis regarding the sources of effective treaty compliance as well as prescriptions for policymakers about how to negotiate more effective future environmental agreements.Global Environmental Accords series</p>"

He presents concrete, detailed evidence from an extensive array of international intelligence materials, including recently declassified CIA, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security reports.&nbsp;<br>
Levitt demolishes the notion that Hamas’ military, political, and social wings are distinct from one another and catalogues the alarming extent to which the organization’s political and social welfare leaders support terror. He exposes Hamas as a unitary organization committed to a militant Islamist ideology, urges the international community to take heed, and offers well-considered ideas for countering the significant threat Hamas poses.</p>"
Deadly Cults: The Crimes Of True Believers,['Robert L. Snow'],"<p>How does a Vampire Cult differ from a Satanic Cult? How do seemingly normal or ordinary citizens suddenly find themselves committed to a group whose leader promotes criminal activities and isolation from families and friends? What should you do if a loved one becomes indoctrinated by a potentially dangerous cult? This book focuses on various cults and their often criminal belief systems. Most readers are shocked by stories of mass suicides and ritualized cult killings, but few understand how such crimes come to be committed. Snow, a seasoned police officer with experience working on cult crimes, examines those cults that commit offenses from murder and fraud to kidnapping and sexual assault.</p>
<p>By providing specific accounts of dangerous cults and their destructive acts, Snow illustrates how seemingly innocent groups can turn pernicious when under the sway of a charismatic leader with an agenda, or when members take things too far. He offers advice on how to avoid falling victim to cult indoctrination, concluding with chapters on how to identify cults, how to protect yourself and your family, and what to do if a loved one is ensnared by such a group.</p>"

The Culture Of Power In Serbia,['Eric D. Gordy'],"<p>How does the regime of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ and his Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) remain in power? Since legitimizing its power in 1990, the SPS has never received a majority of votes in an election. Furthermore, it has been defeated in three military conflicts, produced more than 500,000 refugees, presided over the most extreme hyperinflation in modern times, and failed in its original defining promise to see all Serbs in one state. In <em>The Culture of Power in Serbia</em>, Eric Gordy explores how the MiloÅ¡eviÄ government prolongs its tenure despite failures and setbacks that would have brought down most other regimes.</p><p>Gordy finds the answer in everyday life. The MiloÅ¡eviÄ regime has largely succeeded in making alternatives to its rule unavailable. By controlling key aspects of daily life, including politics, media, and popular music, it has undermined opposition by closing off alternative voices. The result is an atmosphere in which people feel they have lost control over their private life and cultural environment.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gordy finds reason to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for Serbia. The regime's forays into popular music have largely failed, and it has had only partial success in controlling the media, suggesting that the present strategy will not work forever. In Gordy's judgment, the MiloÅ¡eviÄ regime has a limited future.</p><p><em>The Culture of Power in Serbia</em> provides fresh perspective for readers interested in contemporary Eastern Europe, in the strategies and tactics of authoritarian regimes, in the sociology of everyday life, and in the political potential of culture.</p>"
"Fragile Families, Fragile Solutions: A History of Supportive Services for Families in Poverty",['Robert Halpern'],"<p>How has America's social welfare network benefited families living in poverty? In what ways has it failed to provide for their needs? The system of social welfare in the United States has been in place for most of this century-and although it has had lasting impact on the lives of many people in need, it is far from perfect in its handling of the nation's poor. Fragile Families, Fragile Solutions presents a historical perspective on one of the central components of the U.S. social welfare network-family services-and provides a unique look at the advances this service network has achieved, problems it has confronted, and where it is likely to go in the future.</p><p>Beginning with an exploration of the nineteenth-century roots of family services and the emergence of family casework at the beginning of this century, Halpern ranges through the 1920s and 1930â¢ charting the influence of psychoanalytic theory in social service work and government responses to the Depression. He surveys the following two decades, when policymakers attempted to respond to changing inner-city populations. An extended section focuses on the 1960â¢ a critical reform period. Covering a wide spectrum of contemporary issues in policy and organization, as well as escalating crises in such areas as child welfare, Halpern brings readers up to date on this complex subject.</p><p>Offering policy recommendations for the future, Halpern inspires social workers and policymakers alike with a symbolic goal of constructing a more positive vision of the potential of social services, and a pragmatic objective of designing an efficient, effective family services network to care for Americans in greatest need of support.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
The Chinese Experience In America,"['Tsai, Shih-shan Henry.']","<p>How have the Chinese fared in America? What motivated them to come here in the nineteenth century? How were they received by native Americans? These are some of the questions that Henry Tsai deals with in this important new book. He treats the nineteenth-century immigration experience, the development of early Chinese communities, American exclusion and the difficulties of living in the shadow of exclusion, and the Chinese community in the post-World War II era and today. Also covered are Chinese women in conemporary American society, the problems with children and youth in a multiracial society, and international issues such as the relationships between the U.S., China, and Taiwan, and the implications of these issues for the Chinese in America. The work provides a solid statistical analysis in a way that will be accessible to students and scholars as well as general readers.</p>"
The American classics: a personal essay,"['Donoghue, Denis.']","<p>How is a classic book to be defined? How much time must elapse before a work may be judged a “classic”? And among all the works of American literature, which deserve the designation? In this provocative new book Denis Donoghue essays to answer these questions. He presents his own short list of “relative” classics—works whose appeal may not be universal but which nonetheless have occupied an important place in our culture for more than a century. These books have survived the abuses of time—neglect, contempt, indifference, willful readings, excesses of praise, and hyperbole.<br>
Donoghue bestows the term classic on just five American works: Melville’s <i>Moby-Dick</i>, Hawthorne’s <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, Thoreau’s <i>Walden</i>, Whitman’s <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and Twain’s <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>.<br>
Examining each in a separate chapter, he discusses how the writings have been received and interpreted, and he offers his own contemporary readings, suggesting, for example, that in the post9/11 era, <i>Moby-Dick</i> may be rewardingly read as a revenge tragedy. Donoghue extends an irresistible invitation to open the pages of these American classics again, demonstrating with wit and acuity how very much they have to say to us now.</p>"
Islands In The Cosmos: The Evolution Of Life On Land (life Of The Past),['Dale A. Russell'],"<p>How is it that we came to be here? The search for answers to that question has preoccupied humans for millennia. Scientists have sought clues in the genes of living things, in the physical environments of Earth from mountaintops to the depths of the ocean, in the chemistry of this world and those nearby, in the tiniest particles of matter, and in the deepest reaches of space. In Islands of the Cosmos, Dale A. Russell traces a path from the dawn of the universe to speculations about our future on this planet. He centers his story on the physical and biological processes in evolution, which interact to favor more successful, and eliminate less successful, forms of life. Marvelously, these processes reveal latent possibilities in life's basic structure, and propel a major evolutionary theme: the increasing proficiency of biological function. It remains to be seen whether the human form can survive the dynamic processes that brought it into existence. Yet the emergence of the ability to acquire knowledge from experience, to optimize behavior, to conceptualize, to distinguish ""good"" from ""bad"" behavior all hint at an evolutionary outcome that science is only beginning to understand.</p>"

Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide Of Bigotry And Bloodshed,"['Jack Levin', 'Jack Macdevitt']","<p>Howard Beach! The Central Park Jogger! The Assassination of Alan Berg! Vincent Chin's Murder! The Portland Skinhead Slaying! Headlines scream of the latest in a wave of hate crime attacks. Hate crime-violence aimed at individuals because they are members of a particular group - were once considered the rare illegal actions of a small but vocal assortment of extremists who thrived on hating minorities. No more. Hate crimes have been sweeping the nation - as well as the world. They are happening in even the most unlikely of places. Whereas college campuses at one time epitomized the lofty principles of tolerance, diversity, and idealism, they have now become the repositories of hatred and division. Hate is hip on campus, as evidenced not only by the popularity of racist and misogynistic music, but by the recent rash of attacks against blacks, women, Asians, Latinos, Jews, and gays. These perceptive authors step back to reveal how the campus of hate has become a microcosm for the world at large. This expose by Jack Levin, one of America's leading sociologists and co-author of Mass Murder: America's Growing Menace, and Jack McDevitt, America's foremost authority on hate crimes, explores the spreading venom of prejudice and bigotry in our society and the world. They proclaim that political correctness - as in tolerance of diversity - is no longer deemed fashionable but, rather, obsolete. Organized hate groups have been taking our alienated youth by storm. But beyond bemoaning our present crisis, Levin and McDevitt set forth practical guidelines on how to stem the rising tide of hate. These experts persuasively argue that as the economic pie shrinks, a new type of terrorism is leaving a trail of bloodshed and destruction in its wake. For anyone who is different, the message of this new brand of terrorism is unmistakable: Either flee or be killed. These courageous and provocative analysts force us to face a spiraling problem around us as well as the prejudices within</p>

Hirohito: The Emperor And The Man,['Edwin P. Hoyt'],"<p>Hoyt's biography, taking advantage of recent posthumous revelations of a Japanese foreign service diplomat, portrays Hirohito as a man of peace held captive by his role in Japanese society and government . . . <i>Library Journal</i></p>
<p>A successful new book from a topnotch writer . . . <i>Booklist</i></p>
<p>. . . provocative . . . <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>
<p>Was Emperor Hirohito to blame for Japan's expansionist military policies--and its atrocities--in World War II? Was he out to make the world his empire? This most extensive biography of the emperor in English challenges portrayals of Hirohito as either an unworldly scientist or a swashbuckling conspirator who tried to conquer the globe with military might. Using sources uncovered as recently as 1991, Hoyt reveals that the emperor was fundamentally a peace-loving man caught in a turbulent period when the Japanese military gained extraordinary power. He became the virtual prisoner of an Imperial system that prevented him from leading his country into an era of peace and prosperity, his boyhood dream. Hoyt's account, backed by a decade of research, details the emperor's repeated attempts to thwart the Imperial Army's headlong drive toward war. Even when defeat was certain, Hoyt maintains, Hirohito had to outmaneuver the army in order to surrender to Allied forces. Only then, in postwar years, did the emperor see his wishes for his country come true.</p>
<p>To help the reader assess the emperor's life, Hoyt begins by examining the years preceding Hirohito's reign. He then focuses on the Manchurian incidents, the struggle for power in Japan, the China war, the global conflict and Japan's role in it, and the country's final capitulation. Critical passages on events preceding and during World War II, supported by the recently released diaries of men close to the emperor, detail the process by which Hirohito increasingly lost power as the army gained control. Turning his attention to the post-war years, Hoyt chronicles Japan's economic growth and the changing role of the emperor in Japanese society. Photographs from Japanese sources enhance the narrative. Hirohito: The Emperor and the Man offers new insight into the motives of a widely misunderstood leader. Hoyt's Hirohito is a quiet man with scholarly leanings; a patriot who loved his country but also admired Western qualities; a monarch who wished to act responsibly at a critical juncture but lacked the authority to do so.</p>"
Human Development Report 2007/2008: Fighting Climate Change: Human Solidarity In A Divided World,['United Nations Development Programme'],"<p>Human development is about putting people at the center of development. It is about people realizing their potential, increasing choice and enjoying the freedom to lead the lives they value. Created in 1990, the <i>Human Development Report</i> has explored themes including gender equity, democracy, human rights, globalization, cultural liberty and water scarcity.</p>
<p>The past years have witnessed the emergence of a growing consensus on climate change. Governments across the world have seen the warning signs. The science linking global warming to human activity is unequivocal. The economic case for action is compelling: the costs of inaction will heavily outweigh the costs of action. Yet the politics lags behind the science and the economics. Collectively, the world's governments are failing to act with the urgency demanded by the scale of the threat.</p>
<p>The window of opportunity for avoiding dangerous climate change is closing fast. This year's <i>Human Development Report</i> explains why we have less than a decade to change course and start living within our global carbon budget. It explains how climate change will create long-run low human development traps, pushing vulnerable people into a downward spiral of deprivation. Because climate change is a global problem with global causes and effects, it demands a global response with countries acting on the basis of their historic responsibility and capabilities.</p>"

Sigmund Romberg,"['Everett, William A. , 1962-']","<p>Hungarian-born composer Sigmund Romberg (18871951) arrived in America in 1909 and within eight years had achieved his first hit musical on Broadway. This early success was soon followed by others, and in the 1920s his popularity in musical theater was unsurpassed. In this book, William Everett offers the first detailed study of the gifted operetta composer, examining Romberg’s key works and musical accomplishments and demonstrating his lasting importance in the history of American musicals.<br>
Romberg composed nearly sixty works for musical theater as well as music for revues, for musical comedies, and, later in life, for Hollywood films. Everett shows how Romberg was a defining figure of American operetta in the 1910s and 1920s (<i>Maytime, Blossom Time</i>, <i>The Student Prince</i>), traces the new model for operetta that he developed with Oscar Hammerstein&nbsp;II in the late 1920s (<i>The Desert Song, The New Moon</i>), and looks at his reworked style of the 1940s (<i>Up in Central Park</i>).&nbsp; This book offers an illuminating look at Romberg’s Broadway career and legacy.</p>"
Some Even Volunteered: The First Wolfhounds Pacify Vietnam,['Alfred S. Bradford'],"<p>I was hooked by the unusual style and, moreso, by the unusual approach to the familiar material . . . Articulate, sensitive, and intelligent . . . an unusually readable and persuasive narrative. Robert W. Lewis <i>North Dakota Quarterly</i></p>
<p>When in 1968 an American rifle battalion known as the First Wolfhounds landed near Dau Tieng, a rest area controlled by the North Vietnamese Army, they expected to interdict the NVA supply line there within three days. Instead, the soldiers found a prohibitive network of NVA troops, headquarters, hospitals, supplies, and local support for the NVA. It seemed impossible, even for the Wolfhounds, famed for their numbers and fighting strength. In the vivid prose of a mission survivor, <i>Some Even Volunteered</i> chronicles these brave soldiers' daily, deadly contact with the NVA, their attempts to win the villagers' trust, and how they struggled to accept and survive their circumstances. Eight months later, the Wolfhounds succeeded--destroying, in the process, an NVA unit of their own size. Alfred Bradford's sardonic voice is compelling. This narrative is witty, sometimes hilarious, and always captivating. Bradford--now a history professor--also provides one of the most insightful discussions ever written of VietnaM's assumed position in military history.</p>
<p><i>Some Even Volunteered</i> provides a marvelous description and a succinct evaluation of the life and the achievement of the American soldier in Vietnam trying to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese. In a style reminiscent of Michael Herr in Dispatches but still distinctly his own, Bradford relates the story of the First Battalion of the 27th Infantry Regiment (First Wolfhounds) of the 25th Infantry Division as they pacified the district of Tri Tam. The First Battalion--which had the highest body count of any rifle battalion in Vietnam--was air-lifted into an NVA rest area south of Dau Tieng (IIId Brigade basecamp) in the district of Tri Tam on 24 October 1968. They had been ordered to interdict the NVA supply line that stretched from the Ho Chi Minh trail in Cambodia through Dau Tieng to Saigon. They were expected to complete their mission in three days, but they uncovered such an extensive network of headquarters, hospitals, supply, troop concentrations and local support that the mission was extended to a week, then to a month, and finally, to eight months.</p>
<p>Eight months later, the Wolfhounds had succeeded. Their fire support base was assaulted three times, their Brigade base twice. They established four independent forts, ran missions throughout the Third Brigade Area of Operations, and accepted the surrender of dozens of Viet Cong and NVA. In effect, they had destroyed an NVA unit of their own size. In vivid, staccato prose, Bradford delivers a first-rate narrative. In addition, the last chapter, entitled, The Will of the People, provides the reader with one of the best discussions ever written of VietnaM's assumed position in military history.</p>


                        <p>Here is perhaps the best description and evaluation of the life and achievement of the American soldier in Vietnam as they tried to ""win the hearts and minds"" of the Vietnamese. Bradford served with the First Wolfhounds in Vietnam and was awarded the Bronze Star, Air Medal, and Purple Heart.

The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World,['Owen J. Flanagan'],"<p>If consciousness is the hard problem in mind science-explaining how the amazing private world of consciousness emerges from neuronal activity-then the really hard problem, writes Owen Flanagan in this provocative book, is explaining how meaning is possible in the material world. How can we make sense of the magic and mystery of life naturalistically,without an appeal to the supernatural? How do we say truthful and enchanting things about being human if we accept the fact that we are finite material beings living in a material world, or, in Flanagan's description, short-lived pieces of organized cells and tissue? Flanagan's answer is both naturalistic and enchanting. We all wish to live in a meaningful way, to live a life that really matters, to flourish, to achieve eudaimonia-to be a happy spirit. Flanagan calls hisempirical-normative inquiry into the nature, causes, and conditions of human flourishing eudaimonics. Eudaimonics, systematic philosophical investigation that is continuous with science, is the naturalist's response to those who say that science has robbed the world of the meaning that fantastical, wishful stories once provided. Flanagan draws on philosophy, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and psychology, as well as on transformative mindfulness and self-cultivation practices that come from such nontheistic spiritual traditions as Buddhism, Confucianism, Aristotelianism, and Stoicism, in his quest. He gathers from these disciplines knowledge that will help us understand the nature, causes, and constituents of well-being and advance human flourishing. Eudaimonics can help us find out how to make a difference, how to contribute to the accumulation of good effects-how to live a meaningful life.</p><p>The book sparkles with thought and a likeable humour.

Feelings Are Facts: A Life,"['Rainer, Yvonne , 1934-']","<p>If you're interested in Plato, you're reading the wrong book. If you're interested in difficult childhoods, sexual misadventures, aesthetics, cultural history, and the reasons that a club sandwich and other meals—including breakfast—have remained in the memory of the present writer, keep reading.—from Feelings Are Facts In this memoir, dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer traces her personal and artistic coming of age. Feelings Are Facts (the title comes from a dictum by Rainer's one-time psychotherapist) uses diary entries, letters, program notes,excerpts from film scripts, snapshots, and film frame enlargements to present a vivid portrait of an extraordinary artist and woman in postwar America.Rainer tells of a California childhood in which she was farmed out by her parents to foster families and orphanages, of sexual and intellectual initiations in San Francisco and Berkeley, and of artistic discoveries and accomplishments in the New York City dance world. Rainer studied with Martha Graham (and heard Graham declare, ""when you accept yourself as a woman, you will have turn-out""—that is, achieve proper ballet position) and Merce Cunningham in the late 1950s and early 1960s, cofounded the Judson Dance Theater in 1962 (dancing with Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, David Gordon, and Lucinda Childs), hobnobbed with New York artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Morris (her lover and partner for several years), and Yoko Ono, and became involved with feminist and anti-war causes in the 1970s and 1980s. Rainer writes about how she constructed her dances—including The Mind Is a Muscle and its famous section,Trio A, as well as the recent After Many a Summer Dies the Swan—and about turning from dance to film and back to dance. And she writes about meeting her longtime partner Martha Gever and discovering the pleasures of domestic life.The mosaic-like construction of Feelings Are Facts recalls the composition-by-juxtaposition of Rainer's work in film and dance, displaying prismatic variations from what she calls her ""reckless past"" for our amazement and appreciation.</p>"

Interpreting Interpretation: Textual Hermeneutics As An Ascetic Discipline,['William  E. Rogers'],"<p>In <em>Interpreting Interpretation</em>, William E. Rogers searches for a model for literary education. This model should avoid both of two undesirable alternatives. First, it should not destroy any notion of discipline in the traditional sense, terminating in the stance of Rorty's ""liberal ironist."" Second, it should not regard literary education as an attempt to cause students to ingest a pre-determined mix of facts and cultural values, terminating in the stance of E. D. Hirsch's ""cultural literate."" From the semiotics of C. S. Peirce, Rogers develops the notion of interpretive system. The interpretive system called textual hermeneutics is used to interpret interpretation. From that perspective, the world looks like a text. Applying the principle rigorously allows an articulation of the problematic relations among interpretation, philosophy, and language itself.</p>
<p><em>Interpreting Interpretation</em> clarifies the conception of textual hermeneutics as an ascetic discipline by showing the consequences of this conception for interpreting canonical texts and for humanities education in general. Discussions of poetry by Robert Frost and by John Ashbery illustrate how this conception applies to an analysis of literary texts. Ultimately, the book offers a Peircean alternative to the educational theories implied in the pragmatism of John Dewey and of Richard Rorty. Rogers provides a new vocabulary for talking about what people are doing when they read, write, speak, and hear interpretive statements about texts. The new vocabulary acknowledges the great difficulty of ""teaching texts"" in the face of postmodern anxieties about pluralism, relativism, or nihilism. What emerges is not curriculum but method—an argument that the humanities teach not texts but interpretive systems.</p>"
A New Republic: A History Of The United States In The Twentieth Century,['John Lukacs'],"<p>In <i>A New Republic,</i> one of America’s most respected historians offers a major statement on the nature of our political system and a critical look at the underpinnings of our society. American democracy, says John Lukacs, has been transformed from an exercise in individual freedom and opportunity to a bureaucratic system created by and for the dominance of special groups. His book, first published in 1984 as <i>Outgrowing Democracy,</i> is now reissued with a new introduction, in which Lukacs explains his methodology, and a new final chapter, which sums up Lukacs’s thoughts on American democracy today.</p>
<p><i>Reviews of the earlier edition</i></p>
<p>“A rich, subtle, and often ingenious argument . . . an eloquent, provocative, but disturbing book.”—Edwin M. Yoder, Jr., <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p>
<p>“Mr. Lukacs is an original and subtle historian, and [this book] is an engaging intellectual surprise party. . . . I was continuously enchanted by the play of his ideas—by the sharpness of his distinctions and the acuteness of his descriptions.”—Naomi Bliven, <i>New Yorker</i></p>
<p>“It has been a long time since Americans were offered such a provocative interpretation of their historical predicament. . . . We would be foolish not to examine it closely.”—Laurence Tool, <i>Society</i></p>"
Remains Of Being,"['Zabala, Santiago', 'Heidegger, Martin']","<p>In <i>Basic Concepts</i>, Heidegger claims that ""Being is the most worn-out"" and yet also that Being ""remains constantly available."" Santiago Zabala radicalizes the consequences of these little known but significant affirmations. Revisiting the work of Jacques Derrida, Reiner Schürmann, Jean-Luc Nancy, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Ernst Tugendhat, and Gianni Vattimo, he finds these remains of Being within which ontological thought can still operate.</p>
<p>Being is an event, Zabala argues, a kind of generosity and gift that generates astonishment in those who experience it. This sense of wonder has fueled questions of meaning for centuries-from Plato to the present day. Postmetaphysical accounts of Being, as exemplified by the thinkers of Zabala's analysis, as well as by Nietzsche, Dewey, and others he encounters, don't abandon Being. Rather, they reject rigid, determined modes of essentialist thought in favor of more fluid, malleable, and adaptable conceptions, redefining the pursuit and meaning of philosophy itself.</p>"
Whispering City: Rome And Its Histories,['R. J. B. Bosworth'],"<p>In <i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i>, Sigmund Freud claimed that Rome must be comprehended as ""not a human dwelling place but a mental entity,"" in which the palaces of the Caesars still stand alongside modern apartment buildings in layers of brick, mortar, and memory. ""The observer would need merely to shift the focus of his eyes, perhaps, or change his position, in order to call up a view of either the one or the other.""</p>
<p>In this one-of-a-kind book, historian Richard Bosworth accepts Freud's challenge, drawing upon his expertise in Italian pasts to explore the many layers of history found within the Eternal City. Often beginning his analysis with sites and monuments that can still be found in contemporary Rome, Bosworth expands his scope to review how political groups of different eras—the Catholic Church, makers of the Italian nation, Fascists, and ""ordinary"" Romans (be they citizens, immigrants, or tourists)—read meaning into the city around them. Weaving in the city's quintessential figures (Garibaldi, Pius XII, Mussolini, and Berlusconi) and architectural icons (the Vatican, St. Peter's Basilica, the Victor Emmanuel Monument, and EUR) with those forgotten or unknown, Bosworth explores the many histories that whisper their rival and competing messages and seek to impose their truth upon the passing crowds. But as this delightful study will reveal, Rome, that magisterial palimpsest, has never accepted a single reading of its historic meaning.</p>"
Ego Psychology Ii: Psychoanalytic Developmental Psychology,"['Blanck, Gertrude.']","<p>In <i>Ego Psychology II</i>, Gertrude and Rubin Blanck elaborate upon ego psychological theory, extending and broadening it into a psychoanalytic developmental psychology. They present the unifying proposal, derived from Freud's concept of an overall ego (the <i>Gesamt Ich</i>), that the ego is the organizing process itself. Out of this basic proposition, a holistic conception of psychological development evolves.</p>
<p>Within the developmental framework established in <i>Ego Psychology II</i> symptom constellation is shown to be unreliable as a guide to diagnosis. A diagram of development is presented to convey that overall development rather than symptomatology provides guidelines for secure diagnosis and suggests how treatment is to be carried out. Treatment, in the form of ego-building techniques, evolves from recognition that developmental inadequacies cause pathological formations that become malformations in the structure.</p>
<p><i>Ego Psychology II</i> is valuable for psychotherapists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and social workers: the authors' extensive case-study material illustrates the theroy and technique of developmental psychology in vivid form. The authors show also how psychoanalytic developmental psychology updates drive theory, sheds new light on transference, redefines resistance and defense in the poorly structured personalities, clarifies the pathology of the borderline conditions of narcissism, and suggests reconsideration of the manner in which many neurotic formations are attained.</p>

Louis Armstrong And Paul Whiteman: Two Kings Of Jazz,['Joshua Berrett'],"<p>In <i>Louis Armstrong and Paul Whiteman</i> the jazz scholar Joshua Berrett offers a provocative revision of the history of early jazz by focusing on two of its most notable practitioners—Whiteman, legendary in his day, and Armstrong, a legend ever since.<br>
Paul Whiteman’s fame was unmatched throughout the twenties. Bix Beiderbecke, Bing Crosby, and Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey honed their craft on his bandstand. Celebrated as the “King of Jazz” in 1930 in a Universal Studios feature film, Whiteman’s imperium has declined considerably since. The legend of Louis Armstrong, in contrast, grows ever more lustrous: for decades it has been Armstrong, not Whiteman, who has worn the king’s crown.<br>
This dual biography explores these diverging legacies in the context of race, commerce, and the history of early jazz. Early jazz, Berrett argues, was not a story of black innovators and white usurpers. In this book, a much richer, more complicated story emerges—a story of cross-influences, sidemen, sundry movers and shakers who were all part of a collective experience that transcended the category of race. In the world of early jazz, Berrett contends, kingdoms had no borders.</p>"
Political Ideology And Class Formation: A Study Of The Middle Class,['Carolyn Howe'],"<p>In <i>Political Ideology and Class Formation</i>, Carolyn Howe presents an analysis of theories of the middle class, focusing on the class location and political ideology of three strata referred to as managers, knowledge controllers, and semi-professionals. Five theories of the middle class are systematically examined: new class, new working class, new petit bourgeoisie, new labor aristocracy, and contradictory class locations. Using these five theories, the author offers an accessible analysis of recent debates within class analysis and stratification studies.</p>
<p>The first chapter situates these debates within traditional sociological studies of social class, from Marx and Weber to contemporary scholars working within the traditions of Marx and Weber. Using data from the <i>Class Structure and Class Consciousness Study</i> initiated by Erik Olin Wright at the University of Wisconsin, Howe develops a comparative study of the United States and Sweden. She concludes with a new model of the class structure of advanced capitalist countries. In the final chapters, Howe develops an analysis of political-ideological cleavages within classes and looks at the potential for interclass political coalitions and alliances. She states that class analysis must also include an analysis of race and gender, as capitalist societies are also fundamentally structured by race and gender inequalities. Recommended for sociologists, political scientists, and other scholars of class analysis, stratification, political theory, and social movements.</p>"
"The Informant: The Fbi, The Ku Klux Klan, And The Murder Of Viola Liuzzo",['Gary May'],"<p>In <i>The Informant</i>, historian Gary May reveals the untold story of the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, shot to death by members of the violent Birmingham Ku Klux Klan at the end of Martin Luther King’s historic Voting Rights March in 1965. The case drew national attention and was solved almost instantly, because one of the Klansman present during the shooting was Gary Thomas Rowe, an undercover FBI informant. At the time, Rowe’s information and subsequent testimony were heralded as a triumph of law enforcement. But as Gary May reveals in this provocative and powerful book, Rowe’s history of collaboration with both the Klan and the FBI was far more complex.<br>
Based on previously unexamined FBI and Justice Department Records, <i>The Informant</i> demonstrates that in their ongoing efforts to protect Rowe’s cover, the FBI knowingly became an accessory to some of the most grotesque crimes of the Civil Rights era—including a vicious attack on the Freedom Riders and perhaps even the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.<br>
A tale of a renegade informant and an intelligence system ill-prepared to deal with threats from within, <i>The Informant</i> offers a dramatic and cautionary tale about what can happen when secret police power goes unchecked.</p>"
Beyond Marginality: Constructing A Self In The Twilight Of Western Culture,['Rene Muller'],"<p>In <i>The Marginal Self</i> (1987), Ren^D'e J. Muller characterized what he saw as the phenomenon of marginality. Using existential anthropology, he argued that the Judeo-Christian tradition and the tradition of rationality, the bedrock of Western culture for over 2,000 years, no longer provided a satisfactory context for living. He showed how maginalizing choices made in an attenuated Western culture inevitably lead to pathological living and disillusion.</p>
<p>In <i>Beyond Marginality</i>, a sequel, Muller changes his perspective and ground and reinterrogates the phenomenon of the marginal self using the anthropology of Zen. He begins by making explicit the link between marginality and narcissism implied in <i>The Marginal Self</i>, and describes how the narcissistic marginal self developed in a dualistic culture that splits all lived experience in unlivable parts. He shows how the authenticity, freedom, and wholeness that the existentialists struggled to recover from the debris of metaphysics is calmly claimed by Zen as its birthright, originating as it does in a culture untouched by dualism. Using the existential concept of nothingness and the Zen notion of <i>sunyata</i>, Muller builds a bridge between the anthropologies of West and East. He shows how an intrinsically pathological Western culture can be partially reconstructed to go beyond marginality by incorporating elements of Zen's more authentic world view. This book will be of interest to graduate students and faculty in psychology, philosophy, and anthropology, as well as mental health professionals.</p>"
"The Palestinian Hamas: Vision, Violence, And Coexistence","['Shaul Mishal', 'Avraham Sela']","<p>In <i>The Palestinian Hamas</i>, Shaul Mishal and Avraham Sela show that, contrary to its violent image, Hamas (the Islamic Resistance Movement) is essentially a social and political organization, providing extensive community services and responding to political realities through bargaining and power brokering. The authors lift the veil on Hamas's strategic decision-making methods at each of the crucial crossroads it has confronted: the Intifada and the struggle with the PLO, the Oslo accords and the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority, and the choice between absolute jihad against Israel and controlled violence. Now with a new introduction, this book does much to contextualize the current ascendancy of this controversial movement.</p>

The Last Madam: A Life In The New Orleans Underworld,['Chris Wiltz'],"<p>In 1916, at age fifteen, Norma Wallace arrived in New Orleans. Sexy and shrewd, she quickly went from streetwalker to madam and by 1920 had opened what became a legendary house of prostitution. There she entertained a steady stream of governors, gangsters, and movie stars until she was arrested at last in 1962. Shortly before she died in 1974, she tape—recorded her memories-the scandalous stories of a powerful woman who had the city's politicians in her pocket and whose lovers included the twenty-five-year-old boy next door, whom she married when she was sixty-four. Combining those tapes with original research, Christine Wiltz chronicles not just Norma's rise and fall but also the social history of New Orleans, thick with the vice and corruption that flourished there—and, like <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> and <i>Philistines at the Hedgerow,</i> resurrects a vanished secret world.</p>"
"Fate, Time, and Language: An Essay on Free Will",['Steven M. Cahn'],"<p>In 1962, the philosopher Richard Taylor used six commonly accepted presuppositions to imply that human beings have no control over the future. David Foster Wallace not only took issue with Taylor's method, which, according to him, scrambled the relations of logic, language, and the physical world, but also noted a semantic trick at the heart of Taylor's argument.</p><p><i>Fate, Time, and Language</i> presents Wallace's brilliant critique of Taylor's work. Written long before the publication of his fiction and essays, Wallace's thesis reveals his great skepticism of abstract thinking made to function as a negation of something more genuine and real. He was especially suspicious of certain paradigms of thought-the cerebral aestheticism of modernism, the clever gimmickry of postmodernism-that abandoned the very old traditional human verities that have to do with spirituality and emotion and community. As Wallace rises to meet the challenge to free will presented by Taylor, we witness the developing perspective of this major novelist, along with his struggle to establish solid logical ground for his convictions. This volume, edited by Steven M. Cahn and Maureen Eckert, reproduces Taylor's original article and other works on fatalism cited by Wallace. James Ryerson's introduction connects Wallace's early philosophical work to the themes and explorations of his later fiction, and Jay Garfield supplies a critical biographical epilogue.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
"Lost Over Laos: A True Story Of Tragedy, Mystery, And Friendship","['Pyle, Richard.']","<p>In 1971, as American forces hastened their withdrawal from Vietnam, a helicopter was hit by enemy fire over Laos and exploded in a fireball, killing four top combat photographers, Larry Burrows of Life magazine, Henri Huet of Associated Press, Kent Potter of United Press International, and Keisaburo Shimamoto of Newsweek. The Saigon press corps and the American public were stunned, but the remoteness of the location made a recovery attempt impossible. When the war ended four years later in a communist victory, the war zone was sealed off to outsiders, and the helicopter incident faded from most memories. Yet two journalists from the Vietnam press corps- Richard Pyle, former Saigon Bureau Chief, and Horst Faas, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer in Vietnam-pledged to return some day to Laos, resolve mysteries about the crash, and pay homage to their lost friends. True to their vow, twenty-seven years after the incident the authors joined a U.S. team excavating the hillside where the helicopter crashed. Few human remains were found, but camera parts and bits of film provided eerie proof of what happened there.The narrative of Lost Over Laos is framed in a period that was among the war's bloodiest, for both the military and the media, yet has received relatively little attention from historians. It is rich with behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the Saigon press corps and illustrated with stunning work by the four combat photographers who died and their colleagues.</p>"

Why Nuclear Disarmament Matters (boston Review Books),['Hans Blix'],"<p>In 2002 Dr. Hans Blix, then chief United Nations weapons inspector, led his team on a search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Before the United States went to war with Iraq the next March, he maintained there were no WMD in Iraq. History proved him right. For more than forty years Dr. Blix has worked on global disarmament, and with this new book he renews the call for nuclear nonproliferation. His interests, though, go beyond stemming the threat of nuclear attack from rogue states and terrorists. It is not, he argues, a recipe for success for nuclear states to tell the rest of the world that it must stay away from the very weapons that nuclear states claim are indispensable. We will never be able to convince rogue states to halt the pursuit of nuclear weapons programs unless we take the lead in a new nonproliferation and disarmament movement. Looking back at the UN post-World War II efforts against the use of nuclear weapons, Blix documents the retreat from early commitments by nuclear powers, most alarmingly from pledges against first use and toward programs to develop new types of nuclear weapons. He urges us to revive these efforts, and that the world's powers also look at issues of global disarmament and security as pieces of the same puzzle. Why Nuclear Disarmament Matters includes specific suggestions—how the UN can set the stage for a credible multilateral disarmament and nonproliferation process; what kind of treaties would be most helpful—and recommendations for regional policy, including providing the Middle East with enriched uranium for civilian nuclear power production but not allowing uranium enrichment there.From March 2000 to June 2003 Hans Blix was Executive Chairman of the UN Monitoring,Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC). Dr. Blix, author of Disarming Iraq, is Chair of the Swedish government's Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p>"
J.m. Coetzee And Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives On Literature,,"<p>In 2003, South African writer J. M. Coetzee was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his riveting portrayals of racial repression, sexual politics, the guises of reason, and the hypocrisy of human beings toward animals and nature. Coetzee was credited with being ""a scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of western civilization."" The film of his novel <i>Disgrace</i>, starring John Malkovich, brought his challenging ideas to a new audience.</p>
<p>Anton Leist and Peter Singer have assembled an outstanding group of contributors who probe deeply into Coetzee's extensive and extraordinary corpus. They explore his approach to ethical theory and philosophy and pay particular attention to his representation of the human-animal relationship. They also confront Coetzee's depiction of the elementary conditions of life, the origins of morality, the recognition of value in others, the sexual dynamics between men and women, the normality of suppression, and the possibility of equality in postcolonial society. With its wide-ranging consideration of philosophical issues, especially in relation to fiction, this volume stands alone in its extraordinary exchange of ethical and literary inquiry.</p>"
The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need To Know About America's Economic Future (the Mit Press),"['Laurence J. Kotlikoff', 'Scott Burns']","<p>In 2030, as 77 million baby boomers hobble into old age, walkers will outnumber strollers; there will be twice as many retirees as there are today but only 18 percent more workers.</p>
<p>How will America handle this demographic overload? How will Social Security and Medicare function with fewer working taxpayers to support these programs? According to Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns, if our government continues on the course it has set, we'll see skyrocketing tax rates,drastically lower retirement and health benefits, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating dollar,unemployment, and political instability. The government has lost its compass, say Kotlikoff and Burns, and the current administration is heading straight into the coming generational storm.But don't panic. To solve a problem you must first understand it. Kotlikoff and Burns take us on a guided tour of our generational imbalance, first introducing us to the baby boomers — their long retirement years and ""the protracted delay in their departure to the next world."" Then there's the""fiscal child abuse"" that will double the taxes paid by the next generation. There's also the""deficit delusion"" of the under-reported national debt. And none of this, they say, will be solved by any of the popularly touted remedies: cutting taxes, technological progress, immigration, foreign investment, or the elimination of wasteful government spending.So how can the United States avoid this demographic/fiscal collision? Kotlikoff and Burns propose bold new policies, including meaningful reforms of Social Security, and Medicare. Their proposals are simple, straightforward,and geared to attract support from both political parties. But just in case politicians won't take the political risk to chart a new direction, Kotlikoff and Burns also offer a ""life jacket"" —guidelines for individuals to protect their financial health and retirement.</p>"
Direct Marketing In Action: Cutting-edge Strategies For Finding And Keeping The Best Customers,"['Thomas, Andrew R.']","<p>In a marketplace increasingly defined by customer categories with high expectations for service, quality, and responsiveness, companies are discovering that traditional mass marketing approaches are giving way to more targeted approaches that communicate directly with their customers. But to many consumers, direct marketing has a bad reputation, associated with intrusive door-to-door salesmen, dinnertime phone solicitations, junk mail, and, most recently, e-mail spam. In <i>Direct Marketing in Action</i>, a team of experts in the field dispels common myths and misconceptions about direct marketing and showcases the most current practices, principles, and techniques. The authors cover the full range of issues that must be considered in developing an effective direct marketing strategy, including competitive analysis, information and data management, media and channel selection, building brand loyalty, and measuring the results of campaigns. Bridging the gap between research and practice, clearly defining terms and concepts, and featuring numerous examples, <i>Direct Marketing in Action</i> will serve as an essential handbook for marketers and a comprehensive overview for students, teachers, and researchers.</p>

The Hanging Figure: On Suspense And The Films Of Alfred Hitchcock,"['Christophe Morris', 'Christopher D. Morris']","<p>In a radical new interpretation of the works of Alfred Hitchcock, Christopher Morris argues that suspense—the fundamental component of Hitchcock's cinema—is best understood through deconstruction of the very meaning of the word, which relates to dependence or hanging. He analyzes its portrayal first in painting and sculpture and then in Hitchcock's body of work. In this iconographic tradition, hanging figures challenge the significance of human identity and rationality, and further imply that closure, or an end to suspense, is all but illusory.</p>
<p>This work represents the first deconstructive approach to suspense, and the first-ever survey of the iconography of the hanging figure. Hitchcock's films provide ample opportunity for such discussion, with their constant use of the tool of suspense, and Morris argues that, essentially, all of human existence is in this very state, a state embodied particularly well by the films he discusses. Drawing on the work of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and J. Hillis Miller, this cross-disciplinary study of an important cinematic oeuvre establishes the advantage of a deconstructive and figurative approach to an often-studied directorial style, one that nearly embodies a genre unto itself.</p>"
Berlin Witness: An American Diplomat's Chronicle Of East German's Revolution,['G. Jonathan Greenwald'],"<p>In a remarkable combination of personal reflections, official dispatches, and sophisticated political analysis, <em>Berlin Witness</em> recounts the dramatic story of the erosion of Communism in East Germany and the forging of the new Germany. Jonathan Greenwald arrived in East Berlin in the summer of 1987, when discontented East German youths were shouting ""Gorby, Gorby!"" on Unter den Linden and Erich Honecker was still received in Bonn as the respected leader of the Soviet Union's most powerful ally. Germany was divided, and Honecker's GDR was a cornerstone of the armed but apparently stable security order that grew up after the Second World War.</p>
<p>As Political Counselor of the American Embassy, Greenwald expected to chronicle Europe's evolution away from East-West confrontation and to assess for the State Department the implications of strengthening ties between the two German states that were beginning to cause unease in the alliances of both superpowers. Instead, he found and described a revolution that climaxed with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Empire, and the unification of Germany.</p>
<p>The daily entries, beginning with a traditional Communist May Day 1989 when time seemed to stand still, tell the story of that astonishing year from the unique perspective of a senior American diplomat. Greenwald had access not only to the leading personalities of the GDR, including Honecker, Egon Krenz, and Gregor Gysi, but also to the idealistic young people and churchmen who set in motion the events that astonished the world and changed all our lives. He participated in the often frustrating efforts to shape an American policy response to the accelerating crisis. In his Afterword, he offers insightful, and sometimes skeptical, observations about the rush to unification that has left Germany whole and free but racked by new tensions and self-doubts.</p>
<p>Provocative and personal, <em>Berlin Witness</em> is likely to be the definitive American description of the first phase of the German Revolution until the government opens its archives in the next century and will be a valuable resource for anyone wishing to understand the background of the new Germany.</p>"
"Warlords: An Extraordinary Re-creation Of World War Ii Through The Eyes And Minds Of Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, And Stalin","['Simon Berthon', 'Joanna Potts']","<p>In a unique combination of innovative style and thorough scholarship, <i>Warlords</i> tells the story of World War II through the lives of the four great war leaders: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt. While their nations fought battles with weapons, the four warlords of the twentieth century fought a war of the mind. Structured along the lines of a cinematic thriller, rapidly cutting from one man to the next, the book takes us blow by blow as they try to outthink and outfight each other. These encounters are told on a day-by-day, even hour-by-hour basis, affording unparalleled insights into parallel actions. Though there have been many single, and some dual, biographies, <i>no</i> previous book has put these four great figures together in this exciting and popularly appealing way. Moving from Whitehall and Washington to the Wolf's Lair and the Kremlin, <i>Warlords</i> documents the psychological battles among the leaders and shows how their thoughts and actions changed history.</p>"
Marilyn Monroe,['Carl E. Rollyson Jr.'],"<p>In American popular culture Marilyn Monroe has evolved in stature from Hollywood sex symbol to tragic legend. Most books about Monroe stress the sensational events that surrounded her-this book is the first to deal honestly and critically with Monroe as an actress, evaluating her moves as crucial forces in the shaping of her identity. Through careful examination of her performances, from her small appearances in <i>The Asphalt Jungle</i> and <i>All About Eve</i> to her memorable roles in <i>Bus Stop, Some Like It Hot</i>, and the <i>The Misfits</i>, the author traces her development from cover girl innocent to an actress devoted to her craft. Based on extensive interviews with many of Monroe's colleagues, close friends, and mentors, this comprehensive, critically balanced study describes her use of Method acting as well as her instruction with Michael Chekhov and, later, the Strasbergs. Carl Rollyson has written a refreshing analysis and appreciation of Marilyn Monroe's enduring and, until now, underestimated gifts as a creative artist.</p>"
Recognizing Ourselves: Ceremonies of Lesbian and Gay Commitment,['Ellen Lewin'],"<p>In April 1993, as part of the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation, hundreds of couples participated in the Wedding, a symbolic commitment ceremony held in front of the Internal Revenue Service building. Part protest and part affirmation of devotion, the event was a reminder that marriage rights have become a major issue among lesbians and gay men, who cannot marry legally and can only claim domestic partner rights in a few locations in the United States. Yet despite official lack of recognition, same-sex wedding ceremonies have been increasing in frequency over the past decade.</p><p>Ellen Lewin, who has consecrated her own lesbian relationship with a commitment ceremony, decided to explore the myriad ways in which lesbians and gay men create meaningful ceremonies for themselves. She offers the first comprehensive account of lesbian and gay weddings in modern America. A series of richly detailed profiles -- the result of extensive interviews and participation in the planning and realization of many of these commitment rituals -- is woven together to show how new traditions, and ultimately new families, are emerging within contemporary America.</p><p>Just as the book is a moving portrait of same-sex couples today, it is also a significant political document on a new arena in the struggle for lesbian and gay rights. In a larger sense, Lewin's work is about the politics surrounding same-sex marriages and the ramifications for central dimensions of American culture such as kinship, community, morality, and love.</p><p>Lewin explores the ceremonies themselves, which range from traditional church weddings to Wicca rituals in the countryside, with portraits of the planning, the joys, and the anxieties that led up to the weddings. She introduces Bob and Mark, a leather fetishist couple who sanctified their love by legally changing their last names and exchanging vows in tuxedos, leather bow ties, and knee-high police boots. In an equally absorbing profile, Lewin describes Khadija, from a working-class black family deeply suspicious of whites (and especially Jews) and Shulamith, raised in a Zionist household. She tells of how the two women struggled to reconcile their widely disparate upbringings and how they ultimately combined elements of African and Jewish traditions in their wedding. These, among many other stories, make <i>Recognizing Ourselves</i> a vivid tapestry of lesbian and gay life in post-Stonewall United States.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
Professional Savages: Captive Lives And Western Spectacle,['Roslyn Poignant'],"<p>In August 1882 the circus impresario P. T. Barnum called for examples of “all the uncivilized races in existence.” In response, the showman R. A. Cunningham shipped two groups of Australian Aborigines to the United States. They were displayed as “cannibals” in circuses, dime museums, fairgrounds, and other showplaces in America and Europe and examined and photographed by anthropologists.</p>
<p>Roslyn Poignant tells the fascinating and often searing story of the transformation of the Aboriginal travelers into accomplished performers, professional savages who survived at least for a short time by virtue of the strengths they drew from their own culture and their individual adaptability. Most died somewhere on tour. A century later, the mummified body of Tambo, the first to die, was discovered in the basement of a recently closed funeral home in Cleveland, Ohio. Poignant recounts how Tambo’s posthumous repatriation stimulated a cultural renewal within the community from which he came, exposing the roots of present social and economic injustices experienced by indigenous Australians.</p>"
I Want To Be Left Behind: Finding Rapture Here On Earth,['Brenda Peterson'],"<p>In Brenda Peterson’s unusual memoir, fundamentalism meets deep ecology. The author’s childhood in the high Sierra with her forest ranger father led her to embrace the entire natural world, while her Southern Baptist relatives prepared eagerly and busily to leave this world. Peterson survived fierce “sword drill” competitions demanding total recall of the Scriptures and awkward dinner table questions (“Will Rapture take the cat, too?”) only to find that environmentalists with prophecies of doom can also be Endtimers. Peterson paints such a hilarious, loving portrait of each world that the reader, too, may want to be Left Behind.</p>"
Brief Landing On The Earth's Surface (wisconsin Poetry Series),['Juanita Brunk'],"<p>In Brief Landing on the Earth’s Surface, even the most ordinary moments are infused with an awareness of the lost past and a kind of prescience of the future. From one setting to another—Tidewater Virginia, rural Pennsylvania, Greece, New York City—these poems give voice to the human longing for permanence, home, and connection in the face of a constantly changing reality.<br>
&nbsp;</p>


                        <p>""I want to wake up again/ to this world..."" writes Juanita Brunk in her new collection, Brief Landing on the Earth's Surface. The poems in this wide-awake collection (which was chosen by Philip Levine for the 1996 Brittingham Prize) move comfortably between nostalgia and a cheerful interest in the anecdotal, worldly lives we continue to lead.

"Becoming Eichmann: Rethinking The Life, Crimes, And Trial Of A Desk Murderer (eichmann: His Life And Crimes)",['David Cesarani'],"<p>In charge of the logistical apparatus of mass deportation and extinction, Adolf Eichmann was at the center of the Nazi genocide against the Jews. He was personally responsible for transporting over two million Jews to their deaths in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other death camps. This is the first account of Eichmann's life to appear since the aftermath of his famous trial in 1961 and his subsequent execution in Jerusalem a year later. It reveals that the depiction of Eichmann as a loser who drifted into the ranks of the SS is a fabrication that conceals Eichmann's considerable abilities and his early political development. Drawing on recently unearthed documents, David Cesarani shows how Eichmann became the Reich's ""expert"" on Jewish matters and reveals his initially cordial working relationship with Zionist Jews in Germany, despite his intense anti-Semitism. Cesarani explains how the massive ethnic cleansing Eichmann conducted in Poland in 1939-40 was the crucial bridge to his later role in the mass deportation of the Jews. And Cesarani argues controversially that Eichmann was not necessarily predisposed to mass murder, exploring the remarkable, largely unknown period in Eichmann's early career when he first learned how to become an administrator of genocide. This challenging work deepens our understanding of Adolf Eichmann and offers fresh insights both into the operation of the Final Solution and the making of its most notorious perpetrator.</p>"

Environmentalism Unbound: Exploring New Pathways For Change (urban And Industrial Environments),['Robert Gottlieb'],"<p>In Environmentalism Unbound, Robert Gottlieb proposes a new strategy for social and environmental change that involves reframing and linking the movements for environmental justice and pollution prevention. According to Gottlieb, the environmental movement's narrow conception of environment has isolated it from vital issues of everyday life, such as workplace safety, healthy communities, and food security, that are often viewed separately as industrial, community, or agricultural concerns. This fragmented approach prevents an awareness of how these issues are also environmental issues.After tracing a history of environmental perspectives on land and resources,city and countryside, and work and industry, Gottlieb focuses on three compelling examples of this new approach to social and environmental change. The first involves a small industry (dry cleaning)and the debate over pollution prevention approaches; the second involves a set of products (janitorial cleaning supplies) that may be hazardous to workers; and the third explores the obstacles and opportunities presented by community or regional approaches to food supply in the face of an increasingly globalized food system.</p>"
Earnest games,['Carl Lindahl'],"<p>In Ernest Games Carl Lindahl recovers a folkloric world long hidden from readers of Chaucer. Lindahl is the first critic to demonstrate how the poem reflects the social and artistic patterns of medieval folk performance. Combining current approaches from the fields of literary criticism, social history, and folklore, Earnest Games begins with a study of Chaucer's setting and characters. Lindahl discovers that Chaucer gives each community - the gentils, the churls, and the pilgrims - a game strategy that faithfully reflects the social realities of the English Middle Ages.</p>"
They Wished They Were Honest: The Knapp Commission And New York City Police Corruption,['Michael Armstrong'],"<p>In fifty years of prosecuting and defending criminal cases in New York City and elsewhere,Michael F. Armstrong has often dealt with cops. For a single two-year span, as chief counsel to the Knapp Commission, he was charged with investigating them. Based on Armstrong's vivid recollections of this watershed moment in law enforcement accountability -- prompted by the <i>New York Times</i>'s report on whistleblower cop Frank Serpico -- <i>They Wished They Were Honest</i> recreates the dramatic struggles and significance of the Commission and explores the factors that led to its success and the restoration of the NYPD's public image.</p>
<p>Serpico's charges against the NYPD encouraged Mayor John Lindsay to appoint prominent attorney Whitman Knapp to chair a Citizen's Commission on police graft. Overcoming a number of organizational, budgetary, and political hurdles, Chief Counsel Armstrong cobbled together an investigative group of a half-dozen lawyers and a dozen agents. Just when funding was about to run out, the ""blue wall of silence"" collapsed. A flamboyant ""Madame,"" a corrupt lawyer, and a weasely informant led to a ""super thief"" cop, who was trapped and ""turned"" by the Commission. This led to sensational and revelatory hearings, which publicly refuted the notion that departmental corruption was limited to only a ""few rotten apples.""</p>
<p>In the course of his narrative, Armstrong illuminates police investigative strategy; governmental and departmental political maneuvering; ethical and philosophical issues in law enforcement; the efficacy (or lack thereof) of the police's anticorruption efforts; the effectiveness of the training of police officers; the psychological and emotional pressures that lead to corruption; and the effects of police criminality on individuals and society. He concludes with the effects, in today's world, of Knapp and succeeding investigations into police corruption and the value of permanent outside monitoring bodies, such as the special prosecutor's office, formed in response to the Commission's recommendation, as well as the current monitoring commission, of which Armstrong is chairman.</p>

I Love Dollars And Other Stories Of China (weatherhead Books On Asia),['Wen Zhu'],"<p>In five richly imaginative novellas and a short story, Zhu Wen depicts the violence, chaos, and dark comedy of China in the post-Mao era. A frank reflection of the seamier side of his nation's increasingly capitalist society, Zhu Wen's fiction offers an audaciously plainspoken account of the often hedonistic individualism that is feverishly taking root.</p>
<p>Set against the mundane landscapes of contemporary China-a worn Yangtze River vessel, cheap diners, a failing factory, a for-profit hospital operating by dated socialist norms-Zhu Wen's stories zoom in on the often tragicomic minutiae of everyday life in this fast-changing country. With subjects ranging from provincial mafiosi to nightmarish families and oppressed factory workers, his claustrophobic narratives depict a spiritually bankrupt society, periodically rocked by spasms of uncontrolled violence.</p>
<p>For example, <i>I Love Dollars</i>, a story about casual sex in a provincial city whose caustic portrayal of numb disillusionment and cynicism, caused an immediate sensation in the Chinese literary establishment when it was first published. The novella's loose, colloquial voice and sharp focus on the indignity and iniquity of a society trapped between communism and capitalism showcase Zhu Wen's exceptional ability to make literary sense of the bizarre, ideologically confused amalgam that is contemporary China.</p>
<p>Julia Lovell's fluent translation deftly reproduces Zhu Wen's wry sense of humor and powerful command of detail and atmosphere. The first book-length publication of Zhu Wen's fiction in English, I Love Dollars <i>and Other Stories of China</i> offers readers access to a trailblazing author and marks a major contribution to Chinese literature in English.</p>

"From metaphysics to midrash: myth, history, and the interpretation of Scripture in Lurianic Kabbala","['Magid, Shaul , 1958-']","<p>In From Metaphysics to Midrash, Shaul Magid explores the exegetical tradition of Isaac Luria and his followers within the historical context in 16th-century Safed, a unique community that brought practitioners of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam into close contact with one another. Luria's scripture became a theater in which kabbalists redrew boundaries of difference in areas of ethnicity, gender, and the human relation to the divine. Magid investigates how cultural influences altered scriptural exegesis of Lurianic Kabbala in its philosophical, hermeneutical, and historical perspectives. He suggests that Luria and his followers were far from cloistered. They used their considerable skills to weigh in on important matters of the day, offering, at times, some surprising solutions to perennial theological problems.</p>"
Pursuing The Endless Frontier,"['Vest, Charles M.', 'Massachusetts Institute Of Technology.']","<p>In his fourteen years as president of MIT, Charles Vest worked continuously to realize his vision of rebuilding America's trust in science and technology. In a time when the federal government dramatically reduced its funding of academic research programs and industry shifted its R&amp;D resources into the short-term product-development process, Vest called for new partnerships with business and government. He called for universities to meet the intellectual challenges posed by the innovation-driven, globally connected needs of industry even as he reaffirmed basic academic values and the continuing need for longer-term scientific inquiry.In Pursuing the Endless Frontier, Vest addresses these and other issues in a series of essays written during his tenure as president of MIT. He discusses the research university's need to shift to a broader, more international outlook, the value of diversity in the academic community, the greater leadership role for faculty outside the classroom, and the boundless opportunity of new scientific and technological developments even when coupled with financial constraints. In the provocative essay ""What We Don't Know,"" Vest reminds us of what he calls ""the most critical point of all,"" that science is driven by a deep human need to understand nature, to answer the ""big questions"" — that what we don't know is more important than what we do. In another essay, on the future of MIT, he celebrates MIT's strengths as being extraordinarily well-suited to the needs of an era of unprecedented change in science and technology. In ""Disturbing the Educational Universe: Universities in the Digital Age — Dinosaurs or Prometheans,"" he describes MIT's innovative OpenCourseWare initiative, which builds on the fundamental nature of the Internet as an enabling and liberating technology.Vest, who is stepping down from MIT's presidency in the fall of 2004, writes with clarity and insight about the issues facing academic institutions in the twenty-first century.</p>

Dickens And The Dialectic Of Growth,['Badri Raina'],"<p>In his works, from <i>Oliver Twist</i> to <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, Charles Dickens reveals a continuum of artistic as well as social development over a period of four decades. In this highly original study, Badri Raina relates Dickens’ novels thoroughly to one another, illuminating the works by seeing them in terms of the author’s changing social outlook, personal attitudes, and aesthetic practice. Raina’s book will fascinate readers of Dickens, and will serve social historians as well.</p>
<p>The unifying point of Raina’s study is Dickens’ ambivalence toward respectable Victorian bourgeois society; he criticized the bourgeois myths of unbridled success and achievement through aggressive individualism, yet wished to be a great success himself. Raina argues that Dickens projected this personal ambivalence through the creation of key characters and combinations of characters in his novels, creating also a continual movement toward self-awareness and self-criticism. This personal movement, argues Raina, found expression in a steady improvement in the quality of Dickens’ art. Two of the most interesting issues in Dickens studies—that of his development as a novelist and that of his mass appeal in combination with towering aesthetic achievement—are both addressed thoroughly in this lucid and highly readable book.</p>
<p>By following common threads of plot and character through the novels, Raina demonstrates how Dickens matured both socially and artistically, until in his last finished novel, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i>, social values that were earlier espoused (for instance, in <i>Oliver Twist</i>) were wholly and willingly rejected. Raina’s critical procedure illuminates not just the career of a Victorian novelist, but one who embraces, traverses, and evaluates the social climate of a critical period of the nineteenth century.</p>"
Ideas That Shaped Buildings (the Mit Press),['M. Fil Hearn'],"<p>In Ideas That Shaped Buildings, Fil Hearn identifies and codifies into theoretical systems the operative tenets of architectural theory from ancient Rome to the present. With this strikingly original synthesis of architectural history and theory, he constructs an intellectual armature on which virtually any architectural concept, past or present, can be positioned. Dealing mainly with the treatises that have been highly influential historically, he organizes their concepts thematically and analyzes their development through time. Straightforward and concise,Ideas That Shaped Buildings is readily accessible to architecture students, practicing architects,and the general public — indeed anyone interested in understanding the design rationale of buildings. Its overarching message is that, far from being constricting, proper knowledge and application of architectural theory is enabling and inspiring, and makes creative freedom possible by providing the conceptual awareness needed to devise a design.After an introductory history of the development of architectural theory, the text is divided into four parts. The first deals with issues relevant to all theories of architecture. The second, treating theory from antiquity to 1800,focuses on the prescriptive conventions inherent in the classical tradition. The third, treating theory after 1800, focuses on the inspirational principles prompted by rationalist perceptions of the Gothic tradition. The fourth, treating theory since 1965, deals with rationales beyond rationalism and the influence of computers on design method and design formulation. The concepts discussed are illustrated with theoretical drawings and images of actual buildings.</p>"
Refuge Denied: The St. Louis Passengers And The Holocaust,"['Sarah A. Ogilvie', 'Scott Miller']","<p>In May of 1939 the Cuban government turned away the Hamburg-America Line’s MS St. Louis, which carried more than 900 hopeful Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany. The passengers subsequently sought safe haven in the United States, but were rejected once again, and the St. Louis had to embark on an uncertain return voyage to Europe. Finally, the St. Louis passengers found refuge in four western European countries, but only the 288 passengers sent to England evaded the Nazi grip that closed upon continental Europe a year later. Over the years, the fateful voyage of the St. Louis has come to symbolize U.S. indifference to the plight of European Jewry on the eve of World War II.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the episode of the St. Louis is well known, the actual fates of the passengers, once they disembarked, slipped into historical obscurity. Prompted by a former passenger’s curiosity, Sarah Ogilvie and Scott Miller of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum set out in 1996 to discover what happened to each of the 937 passengers. Their investigation, spanning nine years and half the globe, took them to unexpected places and produced surprising results. <i>Refuge Denied</i> chronicles the unraveling of the mystery, from Los Angeles to Havana and from New York to Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the most memorable stories include the fate of a young toolmaker who survived initial selection at Auschwitz because his glasses had gone flying moments before and a Jewish child whose apprenticeship with a baker in wartime France later translated into the establishment of a successful business in the United States. Unfolding like a compelling detective thriller, <i>Refuge Denied</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in the Holocaust and its impact on the lives of ordinary people.</p>"
The Making Of Lee Boyd Malvo: The D.c. Sniper,"['Carmeta Albarus Lcsw', 'Jonathan Mack Ph.d.']","<p>In October of 2002, a series of sniper attacks paralyzed the Washington Beltway, turning normally placid gas stations, parking lots, restaurants, and school grounds into chaotic killing fields. After the spree, ten people were dead and several others wounded. The perpetrators were forty-one-year-old John Allen Muhammad and his seventeen-year-old protégé, Lee Boyd Malvo.</p>
<p>Called in by the judge to serve on Malvo's defense team, social worker Carmeta Albarus was instructed by the court to uncover any information that might help mitigate the death sentence the teen faced. Albarus met with Malvo numerous times and repeatedly traveled back to his homeland of Jamaica, as well as to Antigua, to interview his parents, family members, teachers, and friends. What she uncovered was the story of a once promising, intelligent young man, whose repeated abuse and abandonment left him detached from his biological parents and desperate for guidance and support. In search of a father figure, Malvo instead found John Muhammad, a veteran of the first Gulf War who intentionally shaped his protégé through a ruthlessly efficient campaign of brainwashing, sniper training, and race hatred, turning the susceptible teen into an angry, raging, and dissociated killer with no empathy for his victims.</p>
<p>In this intimate and carefully documented account, Albarus details the nature of Malvo's tragic attachment to his perceived ""hero father,"" his indoctrination, and his subsequent dissociation. She recounts her role in helping to extricate Malvo from the psychological clutches of Muhammad, which led to a dramatic courtroom confrontation with the man who manipulated and exploited him. Psychologist Jonathan H. Mack identifies and analyzes the underlying clinical psychological and behavioral processes that led to Malvo's dissociation and turn toward serial violence. With this tragic tale, the authors emphasize the importance of parental attachment and the need for positive and loving relationships during the critical years of early childhood development. By closely examining the impact of Lee Boyd Malvo's childhood on his later development, they reach out to parents, social workers, and the community for greater awareness and prevention.</p>

Buying Greenhouse Insurance: The Economic Costs Of Co2 Emission Limits,"['Alan S. Manne', 'Richard G. Richels']","<p>In recent years a growing concern that the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases will lead to undesirable changes in global climate has resulted in a number of proposals, both in the United States and internationally, to set physical targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But what will these proposals cost? Based on the authors' earlier ground-breaking work,Buying Greenhouse Insurance outlines a way to think about greenhouse-effect decisions under uncertainty. It describes an insightful model for determining the economic costs of limiting carbon dioxide emissions produced by burning fossil fuels and provides a solid analytical base for rethinking public policy on the farreaching issue of global warming.Manne and Richels present region-by-region estimates of the costs that would underlie an international agreement. Using a computer model known as Global 2100, they analyze the economic impacts of limiting C02 emissions under alternative supply and conservation scenarios. The results clearly indicate that a reduction in emissions is not the sole policy response to potential climate change.Following a summary of the greenhouse effect, its likely causes, and possible consequences, Manne and Richels take up issues that concern the public at large. They provide an overview of Global 2100, look at how the U.S.</p>
<p>energy sector is likely to evolve under businessas-usual conditions and under carbon constraints,and describe the concept of ""greenhouse insurance."" They consider possible global agreements,including an estimate of benefits that might result from trading in an international market in emission rights.

Conquering The Sky: The Secret Flights Of The Wright Brothers At Kitty Hawk,"['Tise, Larry E.']","<p>In seven crucial days of spring 1908, the Wright brothers prepared for what they thought would be a season of secret flights at Kitty Hawk, the culmination of five years spent perfecting their planes. However, they were soon discovered by a host of fast-paced reporters and photographers, forcing the brothers to try to outsmart the world press and avoid close scrutiny of their flying machine and its prowess. Within a few pivotal days, the brothers were catapulted into unwanted worldwide fame as the international press reported their every move using rudimentary telegraphs and early forms of photography. This comedy-of-errors pursuit of pilots and press resulted in a series of bizarre and far-fetched news stories splashed across front pages around the world, by journalists who knew they had just witnessed a milestone in history and were desperate to get to the story first.</p>
<p>In <i>Conquering the Sky</i>, Larry E.

"Snap To Grid: A User's Guide To Digital Arts, Media, And Cultures",['Peter Lunenfeld'],"<p>In Snap to Grid, an idiosyncratic guide to the interactive, telematic era, Peter Lunenfeld maps out the trajectories that digital technologies have traced upon our cultural imaginary. His clear-eyed evaluation of new media includes an impassioned discussion—informed by the discourses of technology, aesthetics, and cultural theory—of the digital artists, designers,and makers who matter most. ""Snap to grid"" is a command that instructs the computer to take hand-drawn lines and plot them precisely in Cartesian space. Users regularly disable this function the moment they open an application because the gains in predictability and accuracy are balanced against the losses of ambiguity and expressiveness. Lunenfeld uses ""snap to grid"" as a metaphor for how we manipulate and think about the electronic culture that enfolds us. In this book he snaps his seduction by the machine to the grid of critical thinking.How can we compare new media to established media? Must we revert to a default dichotomy between utopia and desolation, the notion that media, even digital media, by themselves can redeem or damn us? As he answers these and other questions, Lunenfeld takes into account the post-1989 politico-economic context in which new media have developed and grounds the insights of theory in the constraints of production. Artists discussed include Mark Amerika, Char Davies, Hollis Frampton, William Gibson, Gary Hill, Perry Hobermann, JODI, Christian Möller, Adam Ross, Jennifer Steinkamp, Stelarc, and Diana Thater.</p>"
"Market Women: Black Women Entrepreneurs: Past, Present, And Future",['Cheryl A. Smith'],"<p>In stark contrast to popular belief, women of the African Diaspora have engaged in economic and leadership activities throughout the course of history. Black women around the world draw from a tradition of thousands of years of strategies that have enabled them to face and conquer the challenges of life as women of color. And yet today, black women are marginalized by an economic and financial community still dominated by white men. In <i>Market Women</i>, educator, activist, and entrepreneur Cheryl Smith sets the record straight, applying insights from a variety of fields to trace the roots of black women's entrepreneurship, as it is currently practiced in the United States. Featuring in-depth interviews with 19 present-day entrepreneurs (in ventures as diverse as catering, bookselling, millinery, and construction), Smith reveals an approach to business that is based on personal relationships, pooling of resources, a sense of humor, apprenticeship and mentoring, and strong mother-daughter bonds that defy traditional definitions of business success, wealth creation, and power. In the process she gives voice to a long-disenfranchised group whose struggles and triumphs in business illuminate universal themes that transcend race and gender. The result is a rich and unique study of business from a fresh and eye-opening perspective and an inspiring account of achieving success against tremendous odds.</p>"

Drug Treatment Behind Bars: Prison-based Strategies For Change (contributions In Economic And),['Kevin E. Early'],"<p>In the last 15 years, the prison population in the U.S. increased by more than 188 percent. The increase has been fueled largely by increases in the number of individuals convicted of drug-related offenses. These offenders constitute a disproportionate number of recidivists who, in turn, are responsible for a relatively large proportion of criminal activity in our society. The vast majority of these offenders were arrested for committing violent crimes, and most of the offenders are poor, unemployed, uneducated, come from dysfunctional families, and are African-American. Contrary to public opinion, many of these offenders are tired of their revolving door relationship with the police, courts, and correctional institutions. However, without appropriate social and therapeutic support, there is little hope of altering their behavior. This volume seeks to address specific issues relevant to prisons in America and includes contributions by practitioners in the field of prison-based drug treatment and therapy programs. The work is an important contribution to the literature examining the extent to which rehabilitation (i.e., prison-based drug treatment programs) has effectively reduced recidivism, drug relapse, and violent crime in our society.</p>"
"The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning","['Salen', 'Katie']","<p>In the many studies of games and young people's use of them, little has been written about an overall ecology of gaming, game design and play-mapping the ways that all the various elements, from coding to social practices to aesthetics, coexist in the game world. This volume looks at games as systems in which young users participate, as gamers, producers, and learners. The Ecology of Games (edited by Rules of Play author Katie Salen) aims to expand upon and add nuance to the debate over the value of games-which so far has been vociferous but overly polemical and surprisingly shallow. Game play is credited with fostering new forms of social organization and new ways of thinking and interacting; the contributors work to situate this within a dynamic media ecology that has the participatory nature of gaming at its core. They look at the ways in which youth are empowered through their participation in the creation, uptake, and revision of games; emergent gaming literacies, including modding, world-building, and learning how to navigate a complex system; and how games act as points of departure for other forms of knowledge,literacy, and social organization.ContributorsIan Bogost, Anna Everett, James Paul Gee, Mizuko Ito,Barry Joseph, Laurie McCarthy, Jane McGonigal, Cory Ondrejka, Amit Pitaru, Tom Satwicz, Kurt Squire,Reed Stevens, S.

Transportation In A Climate-constrained World (the Mit Press),"['Andreas Schäfer', 'John B. Heywood', 'Henry D. Jacoby', 'Ian A. Waitz']","<p>In the nineteenth century, horse transportation consumed vast amounts of land for hay production, and the intense traffic and ankle-deep manure created miserable living conditions in urban centers. The introduction of the horseless carriage solved many of these problems but has created others. Today another revolution in transportation seems overdue. Transportation consumes two-thirds of the world's petroleum and has become the largest contributor to global environmental change. Most of this increase in scale can be attributed to the strong desire for personal mobility that comes with economic growth. In Transportation in a Climate-Constrained World, the authors present the first integrated assessment of the factors affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from passenger transportation. They examine such topics as past and future travel demand; the influence of personal and business choices on passenger travel's climate impact; technologies and alternative fuels that may become available to mitigate GHG emissions from passenger transport; and policies that would promote a more sustainable transportation system. And most important, taking into account all of these options are taken together, they consider how to achieve a sustainable transportation system in the next thirty to fifty years.</p>"
"Mothers and Medicine: A Social History of Infant Feeding, 1890-1950",['Rima D. Apple'],"<p>In the nineteenth century, infants were commonly breast-fed; by the middle of the twentieth century, women typically bottle-fed their babies on the advice of their doctors.&nbsp; In this book, Rima D. Apple discloses and analyzes the complex interactions of science, medicine, economics, and culture that underlie this dramatic shift in infant-care practices and womenâs lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As infant feeding became the keystone of the emerging specialty of pediatrics in the twentieth century, the manufacture of infant food became a lucrative industry.&nbsp; More and more mothers reported difficulty in nursing their babies.&nbsp; While physicians were establishing themselves and the scientific experts and the infant-food industry was hawking the scientific bases of their products, women embraced 'scientific motherhood,' believing that science could shape child care practices.&nbsp; The commercialization and medicalization of infant care established an environment that made bottle feeding not only less feared by many mothers, but indeed 'natural' and 'necessary.'&nbsp; Focusing on the history of infant feeding, this book clarifies the major elements involved in the complex and sometimes contradictory interaction between women and the medical profession, revealing much about the changing roles of mothers and physicians in American society.<br><br>'The strength of Appleâs book is her ability to indicate how the mutual interests of mothers, doctors, and manufacturers led to the transformation of infant feeding. . . . Historians of science will be impressed with the way she probes the connections between the medical profession and the manufacturers and with her ability to demonstrate how medical theories were translated into medical practice.'-Janet Golden, <i>Isis</i><br>&nbsp;</p>"

Stalin's Secret Pogrom: The Postwar Inquisition Of The Jewish Anti-fascist Committee (annals Of Communism),"['Joshua Rubenstein', 'Vladimir P. Naumov', 'Laura E. Wolfson']","<p>In the spring and summer of 1952, fifteen Soviet Jews, including five prominent Yiddish writers and poets, were secretly tried and convicted; multiple executions soon followed in the basement of Moscow’s Lubyanka prison. The defendants were falsely charged with treason and espionage because of their involvement in the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, and because of their heartfelt response as Jews to Nazi atrocities on occupied Soviet territory. Stalin had created the committee to rally support for the Soviet Union during World War II, but he then disbanded it after the war as his paranoia mounted about Soviet Jews.<br>
For many years, a host of myths surrounded the case against the committee. Now this book, which presents an abridged version of the long-suppressed transcript of the trial, reveals the Kremlin’s machinery of destruction. Joshua Rubenstein provides annotations about the players and events surrounding the case. In a long introduction, drawing on newly released documents in Moscow archives and on interviews with relatives of the defendants in Israel, Russia, and the United States, Rubenstein also sets the trial in historical and political context and offers a vivid account of Stalin’s anti-Semitic campaign.</p>

From Social Worker To Crimefighter: Women In United States Municipal Policing,"['Schulz, Dorothy Moses.']","<p>In the United States, women in policing evolved from matrons to policewomen to police officers. Today, the position of police chief has been achieved by women. The changing role of women in this traditionally male-dominated field is the subject of this book. It weaves together the history of the police and the history of women and highlights a century of change in law enforcement. The book also describes how the changing role of women in society affected their role in law enforcement.</p>"
Spectacle: Media and the Making of the O.J. Simpson Story,['Paul Thaler'],"<p>In the Year of Simpson, the country was caught in the throes of the biggest story ever. No other single news event in our history could match the sheer scope and intensity of coverage given to the O. J. Simpson murder case. But the media did not just report the Simpson case, they were instrumental in creating it-a spectacle of such stupendous proportions that it hijacked American culture. In this critical expos^D'e of American media, Thaler presents a riveting narrative about the men and women who gave us the story of the century. It is a sprawling tale of the media grappling with their role as news-reporting entities; seduced by the values of entertainment and tabloidism; and faced with increased competition, fragmented audiences, and frantic pressure to keep both eyes on the bottom line.</p><p>The Simpson story is one of exploitation, of media overkill and outright pandering, of huge profitmaking, all of which undermined the trial and fueled tremendous public cynicism about the way in which justice-and the media-work in this country. For more than a year, America was held captive to the great murder story. In Thaler's analysis, the media, more than any other single participant, altered the workings of the Simpson courtroom and the outcome of one of the most celebrated trials in America's history. From the first coverage of the murders to the final days of the trial of the century, the media were not only telling us what had become of justice in this country, but also what had become of them. This is that story.</p>"
Listening For A President: A Citizen's Campaign Methodology,"['Brennan, Ruth M. Gonchar.']","<p>In their tenth co-authored study, Brennan and Hahn propose both a new method of biographical study for students of political communication and a new way of evaluating candidates for presidential office. The authors argue that given the biases inherent in the print and broadcast media, the only way to obtain accurate assessment about presidential candidates is to analyze information from the primary sources--the candidates themselves. They show how careful listening and rigorous analysis can enable the reader to extract reliable clues to presidential competence from the speeches, debates, press conferences, and advertising spots of the candidates. Challenging traditional rhetorical criticism in which biography is used to help evaluate speeches, Brennan and Hahn demonstrate that speeches can be effectively used to arrive at reliable evaluations of speakers.</p>
<p>In order to establish the need for a new approach, the authors begin with a critique of the major extant methods of political analysis (biography, psychobiography, political biography and rhetorical biography). They then respond to that need by focusing on methods of analyzing information directly from political speeches and other utterances, identifying five major arenas for evaluating candidates: personality orientation, leadership ideal, ideology, epistemology, and axiology. Each of the arenas is divided into theory and application sections, providing the reader with both the methods in practice and an understanding of why they work. The final chapter examines the relationship of the media to political analysis. A comprehensive bibliography completes the work.</p>"
Generational Policy (cairoli Lectures),['Laurence J. Kotlikoff'],"<p>In these eight 2002 Cairoli Lectures, presented at the Universidad Torcuato di Tella in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Laurence Kotlikoff shows how generational policy works, how it is measured, and how much it matters. Kotlikoff discusses the incidence and measurement of generational policy, the relationship of generational policy to monetary policy, and the vacuity of deficits,taxes, and transfer payments as economic measures of fiscal policy. Kotlikoff also illustrates generational policy's general equilibrium effects with a dynamic life-cycle simulation model and reviews the empirical evidence testing intergenerational altruism and risk sharing.The lectures were delivered as Argentina faced a devastating depression triggered, in large part, by unsustainable generational policy. Throughout the book, Kotlikoff connects his messages about generational policy to the Argentine situation and the Argentine government's policy mistakes.</p>"
30-second politics: political advertising in the eighties,"['Kern, Montague , 1942-']","<p>In this age of the media campaign where television is Americans' preferred source of candidate information, Montague Kern offers insightful scrutiny of political advertisements from 1972 to the present. This book closely examines a sample of ads and news coverage in the last stage of the 1984 presidential election, and in senatorial, gubernatorial, and house elections in four geographically diverse markets. Kern interviews campaign consultants as well as campaign managers and outlines the significant changes in political advertising over the past two decades. She finds, on the basis of an ad sample, that most competitive senatorial and gubernatorial races in 1986 used negative advertising. The book goes on to explain the rise of negative advertising in the presidential race of 1988. In an era in which media consultants are increasingly assuming primary responsibility for press relations, the study demonstrates that ads can overwhelm news coverage and serve many purposes in addition to providing voters with campaign information. The informed general reader seeking a better understanding of the political advertisement phenomenon, journalists who cover political campaigns, as well as scholars in communications and political science, will find 30-Second Politics invaluable reading.</p>"
Slavery &amp; race in American popular culture,['William L.Van Deburg'],"<p>In this ambitious work, William L. Van Deburg offers the first inter-disciplinary survey of American popular culture and its historical attitudes toward slavery and race. Spanning more than three centuries, from the colonial era to the present, Van Deburg's overview analyzes the works of American historians, dramatists, novelists, poets, lyricists, and filmmakers, and exposes, through those artists' often disquieting perceptions, the cultural underpinnings of our current racial attitudes and divisions. Anyone interested in American history, Afro-American studies, slavery, mass culture, or literature will find this work to be essential reading, both as far-ranging cultural history and as an important study of how we came to be a nation still enslaved by popular stereotypes,</p>"
Open Wound: The Long View of Race in America,['William McKee Evans'],"<p>In this boldly interpretive narrative, William McKee Evans tells the story of America's paradox of democracy entangled with a centuries-old system of racial oppression. This racial system of interacting practices and ideas first justified black slavery, then, after the Civil War, other forms of coerced black labor and, today, black poverty and unemployment.</p><p>At three historical moments, a crisis in the larger society opened political space for idealists to challenge the racial system: during the American Revolution, then during the irrepressible conflict ending in the Civil War, and, finally, during the Cold War and the colonial liberation movements. Each challenge resulted in an historic advance. But none swept clean. Many African Americans remain segregated in jobless ghettoes with dilapidated schools and dismal prospects in an increasingly polarized class society.</p><p>Evans sees a new crisis looming in a convergence of environmental disaster, endless wars, and economic collapse, which may again open space for a challenge to the racial system. African Americans, with their memory of their centuries-old struggle against oppressors, appear uniquely placed to play a central role.</p>"
The Actor In History: Studies In Shakespearean Stage Poetry,['David Grene'],"<p>In this book an eminent scholar considers the relation which Shakespeare establishes between the values of the supreme world of Elizabethan and Jacobean reality, that of the kings and soldiers at the top of the tree, and his own domain, the poetry of the theater. Ostensibly, that poetry emphasizes straightforwardly the values of the plot of the play —by his poetry, the king or soldier becomes more visible to us. The rhythms of his voice, the verbal images and innuendos, reinforce the man's kingship or soldiership. But at other times, what takes place is different. Starting from a shadowy identification of the character with his position in the play, the poetry begins to substitute its independent or nearly independent values—its power to charm and to threaten and expand the ""meaning"" of the actor vis-à-vis his role. The character we watch on the stage escapes into an area where the sensations with which his acting affects us come also directly from his histrionic relation to us. He becomes an actor as such and less an actor of Brutus or Antony or Coriolanus. We are all the more moved because we know that the histrionic is a representation of the reality of emotion, as definite and valid as impressionism is of the visual truth of the external world. In certain plays Shakespeare puts at variance our sense of the histrionic against the more usual values which we set upon political and military achievement. The fantasy of <em>Richard II</em>, for example, is his escape from the harshness of the historical circumstances that belittle his capacity; clothed in poetry and growing into the actual presentation of the actor who rendered the part, it dominates us to the devaluing of the winner in the plot's competition.</p>"
"An Illustrated History Of Horror And Science-fiction Films: The Classic Era, 1895-1967",['Carlos Clarens'],"<p>In this book Carlos Clarens, author of <i>Crime Movies</i> (also available from Da Capo/Perseus), <i>George Cukor,</i> and many articles in film magazines, brings his encyclopedic knowledge of films and filmmakers to the subject of horror and science-fiction films of the classic era. Whether discussing the erotic aspects of <i>King Kong,</i> examining the works of Val Lewton, contrasting the director’s attitude toward the monster in <i>Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein</i>, accounting for the special genius of Lon Chaney, or comparing the various versions of <i>Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde,</i> Clarens entertains as he enlightens. Supplemented with a new introduction by J.

The Economic Dynamics Of Environmental Law,"['Driesen, David M.']","<p>In this book David Driesen shows in detail how the concept of economic dynamics can reshape thinking about environmental law and policy. He argues that environmental policymaking in the United States has been poorly served by the dominant, static view of the relationship between environmental regulation and the economy, technology, and business. Basing public policy on the concept of economic efficiency, he claims, warps our sense of what is necessary and achievable in environmental lawmaking.According to Driesen, environmentally beneficial technological innovation would be a more effective public policy goal than economic efficiency because it could better keep pace with private-sector innovations that create new forms of pollution and resource destruction.</p>
<p>His arguments provide a corrective to the free-market and cost-benefit analysis approaches common to most proposals for regulatory reform. Those who believe that environmental law should focus on economic efficiency assume that efficiency and innovation coincide. But static efficiency may detract from, rather than stimulate, creativity in the real world. Cost-benefit analysis may discourage innovation by adding delay and uncertainty to government decisions. Economic incentives such as emissions trading may facilitate better use of existing techniques rather than bring about fundamental changes in technology. Driesen suggests ways that the regulatory system could better foster environmentally beneficial technological innovations. Using the theory of economic dynamics,he discusses privatizing environmental law, reforming administrative and international legal processes, and improving regulation design. He also explains the significance of economic dynamics for legal theory in general.</p>"

Black Manhattan,['Sondra Kathryn Wilson'],"<p>In this classic work, first published in 1930, James Weldon Johnson, one of the leading lights of the Harlem Renaissance, combined the skills of the historian, social scientist, and the reporter to trace the New York black experience from the earliest settlements on Chatham Square during the pre-revolutionary period to the triumphant achievements of Harlem in the 1920s. But <i>Black Manhattan</i> is by no means simply history; It illuminates Johnson and his contributions to both black literature and black organizations; it provides us with an intimate account of the black theatrical and musical world of which Johnson had been a part; and it raises searching questions about the black people's struggle to find their identity. <i>Black Manhattan</i> remains one of the essential books on the black American experience, losing none of its resonance and value after many decades.</p>"

The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope And Limits Of Computational Psychology,['Jerry A. Fodor'],"<p>In this engaging book, Jerry Fodor argues against the widely held view that mental processes are largely computations, that the architecture of cognition is massively modular, and that the explanation of our innate mental structure is basically Darwinian. Although Fodor has praised the computational theory of mind as the best theory of cognition that we have got, he considers it to be only a fragment of the truth. In fact, he claims, cognitive scientists do not really know much yet about how the mind works (the book's title refers to Steve Pinker's How the Mind Works).Fodor's primary aim is to explore the relationship among computational and modular theories of mind, nativism, and evolutionary psychology. Along the way, he explains how Chomsky's version of nativism differs from that of the widely received New Synthesis approach. He concludes that although we have no grounds to suppose that most of the mind is modular, we have no idea how nonmodular cognition could work. Thus, according to Fodor, cognitive science has hardly gotten started.</p>"
The Nightingale’s Burden: Women Poets And American Culture Before 1900,['Cheryl Walker'],"<p>In this evocative exploration, Cheryl Walker shows that there is a distinct tradition of women's poetry in America—one that the poets themselves have not always been fully aware of—and that individual poems can be read as manifestations of that tradition. Philomela, the nightingale of literary mythology, serves as a model for women poets, representing simultaneously both their particular forms of power and the frustrating powerlessness imposed on them by the cultural norms for women. The author identifies a number of archetypal motifs: the power fantasy, the sanctuary poem, the renunciation poem, the forbidden lover poem, the ""burden of beauty,"" and the ""secret sorrow."" Among the poets discussed are Anne Bradstreet, Phillis Wheatley, Lydia Sigourney, Frances Osgood, Julia Ward Howe, Margaret Fuller, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and Louise Guiney.</p>"

The stories themselves present true examples of valor, courage, and sacrifice. More than stories, however, they recount moments of significance in the life of our country.</p>
<p>The Congressional Medal of Honor is the highest award given to American servicemen for valor in battle. Only slightly more than 200 recipients of the Medal of Honor are alive today. In this extraordinary book, 15 recipients tell the stories of the actions for which they received their awards.

Individually, they are fifteen profiles of the Hero.</p>
<p>The stories, based on interviews with the recipients and written by Kent DeLong, the attending physician of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, are well-told and exciting. They present true examples of valor, courage, and sacrifice. But they are more than just stories. They are the oral history of significant moments in the life of our country.</p>"
"Thunder Over The Horizon: From V-2 Rockets To Ballistic Missiles (war, Technology, And History)",['Clayton K.s. Chun'],"<p>In this general history of the development of rockets and missiles, Chun traces the technology that made attack from beyond the horizon possible. A former missile launch officer, he focusess not only on the development and employment of the ballistic missile—from early German V-2 use to today—but on their subsequent impact on national strategies, doctrine, force structure, and politics. The development of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads had a profound impact on superpower rivalries and structured international relations for decades. The advent of the ballistic missile changed the way nations believed war was to be fought in the future. Ballistic missiles (land based and submarine-launched) are now global in scope. Accordingly, the book covers Russia, China, North Korea, South Asia, and the Middle East. It details actual use in combat, as well as current countermeasures and future missile defense systems.</p>

Anne Boleyn: Fatal Attractions,"['Bernard, G. W.']","<p>In this groundbreaking new biography, G. W. Bernard offers a fresh portrait of one of England’s most captivating queens. Through a wide-ranging forensic examination of sixteenth-century sources, Bernard reconsiders Boleyn’s girlhood, her experience at the French court, the nature of her relationship with Henry, and the authenticity of her evangelical sympathies.</p>
<p>He depicts Anne Boleyn as a captivating, intelligent, and highly sexual woman whose attractions Henry resisted for years until marriage could ensure legitimacy for their offspring. He shows that it was Henry, not Anne, who developed the ideas that led to the break with Rome. And, most radically, he argues that the allegations of adultery that led to Anne’s execution in the Tower could be close to the truth.</p>"
Making America Competitive: Policies For A Global Future,"['Whicker, Marcia Lynn.']","<p>In this groundbreaking new study, Whicker and Moore address an issue of critical importance to the future economic and political stability of the United States: how can this nation become more competitive in international markets. Drawing upon economic theory, political philosophy, and specific policy expertise, the authors organize their work around two principle themes: that just as the role of government in a changing world is evolutionary, policies must evolve to reflect shifting economic realities, and that previously hostile attitudes among U.S. management, labor, and government must be replaced by cooperation in order to ensure effective, long-term competitiveness abroad.</p>"
Impressionism: Paint And Politics,['John House'],"<p>In this handsome book, a leading authority on Impressionist painting offers a new view of this admired and immensely popular art form. John House examines the style and technique, subject matter and imagery, exhibiting and marketing strategies, and social, political, and ideological contexts of Impressionism in light of the perspectives that have been brought to it in the last twenty years. When all of these diverse approaches are taken into account, he argues, Impressionism can be seen as a movement that challenged both artistic and political authority with its uncompromisingly modern subject matter and its determinedly secular worldview.<br>
Moving from the late 1860s to the early 1880s, House analyzes the paintings and career strategies of the leading Impressionist artists, pointing out the ways in which they countered the dominant conventions of the contemporary art world and evolved their distinctive and immediately recognizable manner of painting. Focusing closely on the technique, composition, and imagery of the paintings themselves and combining this fresh appraisal with recent historical studies of Impressionism, House explores how pictorial style could generate social and political meanings and opens new ways of looking at this luminous art.</p>"
Boggs: A Comedy Of Values (passions And Wonders Series),['Lawrence Weschler'],"<p>In this highly entertaining book, Lawrence Weschler chronicles the antics of J. S. G. Boggs, an artist whose consuming passion is money, or perhaps more precisely, value. Boggs draws money-paper notes in standard currencies from all over the world-and tries to spend his drawings. It is a practice that regularly lands him in trouble with treasury police around the globe and provokes fundamental questions regarding the value of art and the value of money.</p>
<p>""Lawrence Weschler, who evidently admires [Boggs]-something not difficult to do-has written what may be the most extraordinary biography imaginable: ""weird,"" to use a favourite Boggs word. It does something towards changing our entire outlook on money and its uses. And the reader is left with an uneasy feeling that anything in this world can be created by drawing it."" —Ruth Rendell, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p>
<p>""As ideal a subject matter as money is for Boggs' genius, Boggs is as ideal a topic for Weschler's considerable talents. . . . A writer any less lucid than Weschler would smudge the lines, making of Boggs a counterculture caricature or a high-art huckster. And a writer any less confident would knock the balance, making academic mud pies of Boggs' enlightened chaos."" —Jonathon Keats, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i></p>
<p>""[A] witty and engaging chronicle. . . . Weschler's fascinating account of the artist as agent provocateur demonstrates both the significance of Boggs's art and his determination to continue his unusual critique of the idea of money."" —Henry Wessells, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p>
<p>""[A] witty, excellently written account of a bizarre and fascinating snippet of modern life."" —Paul Ormerod, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p>
<p>""The book, like the artist, challenges people to pause and consider the extent to which the economic bedrock of everyday life is in part a confusing welter of artistic abstractions. It's a work that is at once informative, entertaining, and provocative-a reading experience, one might say, of rather good value."" —Toby Lester, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i></p>

Forgive Us Our Debts: The Intergenerational Dangers Of Fiscal Irresponsibility,"['Yarrow, Andrew L.']","<p>In this immensely timely book, Andrew Yarrow brings the sometimes eye-glazing discussion of national debt down to earth, explaining in accessible terms why federal debt is rising (and will soon rise much faster), what effects it may have on Americans if debt is not brought under control, why our government borrows, and what it will take to pay it all back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picture Yarrow paints should concern all Americans. Specifically, he brings to light how rising Medicare, Social Security, and other spending on one hand, and insufficient government revenues on the other, make a mockery of fiscal responsibility. Deficits and debt, Yarrow asserts, are crowding out spending on needed investments in science, environment, infrastructure, and other domestic discretionary programs and could severely harm our nation’s and our citizens’ future. But he makes clear that this does not have to be a doomsday scenario. If we act in a bipartisan fashion to restore fiscal health, our legacy to the next generation can be much more than trillions of dollars of IOUs.</p>

Affirmative Action Around The World: An Empirical Study (yale Nota Bene S),['Thomas Sowell'],"<p>In this important book, an eminent authority presents a new perspective on affirmative action, investigating its actual consequences in the United States and in other countries where it has been in effect. Evaluating his empirical data, Thomas Sowell concludes that race preference programs worldwide have not met expectations and have often produced the opposite of what was originally intended.</p>
<p>“A delight: terse, well-argued, and utterly convincing.”—<i>Economist</i></p>
<p>“Among contemporary economists and social theorists, one of the most prolific, intellectually independent, and iconoclastic is Thomas Sowell. . . . Enormously learned, wonderfully clear-headed, he sees reality as it is, and flinches at no truth. . . . Sowell’s presentation of the data is instructive and illuminating—and disturbing.”—Carl Cohen, <i>Commentary</i></p>
<p>“Another brilliant, bracing achievement by Thomas Sowell. With characteristic lucidity, erudition, and depth, Sowell examines the true effects of affirmative action around the globe. This book is compelling, important, mind-opening.”—Amy Chua, author of <i>World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability</i></p>
<p>“A masterpiece that deserves to be one of the most influential books of our time. Any honest reader will be informed and enlightened.”—Donald Kagan, Yale University</p>

The Persistence Of Poverty: Why The Economics Of The Well-off Can't Help The Poor,['Charles H. Karelis'],"<p>In this important book, one of our boldest and most original thinkers charges that conventional explanations of poverty are mistaken, and that the anti-poverty policies built upon them are doomed to fail. Using science, history, fables, philosophical analysis, and common observation, Charles Karelis engages us and takes us to a deeper grasp of the link between consumption and satisfaction—and from there to a new and persuasive explanation of what keeps poor people poor. Above all, he shows how this fresh perspective can reinspire the long-stalled campaign against poverty.</p>"
So Long As Men Can Breathe: The Untold Story Of Shakespeare's Sonnets,"['Heylin, Clinton.']","<p>In this lively, fascinating account of the publication of Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i>, noted biographer Clinton Heylin brings their convoluted history to light, beginning with the first complete appearance of the <i>Sonnets</i> in print in May, 1609. He introduces us to the “unholy alliance” involved in this precarious enterprise: Thomas Thorpe, the publisher, a self-described “well wishing adventurer;” George Eld, the printer, heavily embroiled in large-scale pirating; William Aspley, the prestigious bookseller, who mysteriously ended his association with Thorpe soon after.</p>
<p>Leaving the calamitous world of Elizabethan publishing, Heylin goes on to chart the many editions of the <i>Sonnets</i> through the years and the editorial decisions that led to their present configuration. Passionate, astute, and brilliantly entertaining, the result is a concise and vivid history of perhaps the greatest poetry ever written.</p>"
"American Dream, American Nightmare: Fiction Since 1960","['Hume, Kathryn , 1945-']","<p>In this masterful survey of American fiction since 1960, Kathryn Hume explores how estrangement from America has shaped the fiction of a literary generation, which she calls the Generation of the Lost Dream.</p>
<p>Examining the differing critiques of America embedded in nearly one hundred novels, Hume breaks down the divisions among standard categories of race, religion, ethnicity, and gender. She identifies shared core concerns, values, and techniques among seemingly disparate and unconnected writers including T. Coraghessan Boyle, Ralph Ellison, Russell Banks, Gloria Naylor, Tim O'Brien, Maxine Hong Kingston, Walker Percy, N. Scott Momaday, John Updike, Toni Morrison, William Kennedy, Julia Alvarez, Thomas Pynchon, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Don DeLillo.</p>
<p>Hume explores fictional treatments of the slippage in the immigrant experience between America's promise and its reality. She exposes the political link between contemporary stories of lost innocence and liberalism's inadequacies. She also invites us to look at the literary challenge to scientific materialism in various searches for a spiritual dimension in life.<br>

No Ordinary Angel: Celestial Spirits and Christian Claims about Jesus,['Susan R. Garrett'],"<p>In this provocative, intelligent, and highly original addition to the Anchor Yale Bible Reference Library, Susan R. Garrett argues that angel talk has never been merely about angels. Rather, from ancient times until the present, talk about angels has served as a vehicle for reflection on other fundamental life questions, including the nature of Godâs presence and intervention in the world, the existence and meaning of evil, and the fate of humans after death. In <i>No Ordinary Angel</i>, Garrett examines how biblical and other ancient authors addressed such questions through their portrayals of angels. She compares the ancient angel talk to popular depictions of angels today and considers how the ancient and modern portraits of angels relate to Christian claims about Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>No Ordinary Angel</i> offers important insights into the development of angelology, the origins of Christology, and popular Western spirituality ranging from fundamentalist to New Age. In doing so, it provokes stimulating theological reflection on key existential questions.</p>"
The Future Of Learning Institutions In A Digital Age (john D. And Catherine T. Macarthur Foundation Reports On Digital Media And Learning),"['Cathy N. Davidson', 'David Theo Goldberg']","<p>In this report, Cathy Davidson and David Theo Goldberg focus on the potential for shared and interactive learning made possible by the Internet. They argue that the single most important characteristic of the Internet is its capacity for world-wide community and the limitless exchange of ideas. The Internet brings about a way of learning that is not new or revolutionary but is now the norm for today's graduating high school and college classes. It is for this reason that Davidson and Goldberg call on us to examine potential new models of digital learning and rethink our virtually enabled and enhanced learning institutions.This report is available in a free digital edition on the MIT Press website at http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262513593.John D. and Catherine T.</p>

New Digital Media And Learning As An Emerging Area And Worked Examples As One Way Forward (the John D. And Catherine T. Macarthur Foundation Reports On Digital Media And Learning),['James Paul Gee'],"<p>In this report, noted scholar James Paul Gee discusses the evolution of digital media and learning (DMAL) from its infancy as an ""academic area"" into a more organized field or coherent discipline. Distinguishing among academic areas, fields, disciplinary specializations, and thematic disciplines, Gee describes other academic areas that have fallen into these categories or developed into established disciplines. He argues that DMAL will not evolve until a real coherence develops through collaboration and the accumulation of shared knowledge. Gee offers a concrete proposal of one way scholars in DMAL could move the area forward to a more cohesive, integrated, and collaborative enterprise: the production of what he terms ""worked examples."" In Gee's sense of a worked example, scholars attempting to build the new area of DMAL would publicly display their methods of valuing and thinking about a specific problem, proposing them as examples of""good work"" in order to engender debate about what such work in DMAL might come to look like and what shape the area itself might take. The goal would not be for the proposed approach to become the accepted one but for it to become fodder for new work and collaboration. Gee concludes by offering a sample worked example that illustrates his proposal.</p>"
Sin: A History,['Gary A. Anderson'],"<p>In this sensitive, imaginative, and original work, Gary A. Anderson shows how changing conceptions of sin and forgiveness lay at the very heart of the biblical tradition. Spanning nearly two thousand years, the book brilliantly demonstrates how sin, once conceived of as a physical burden, becomes, over time, eclipsed by economic metaphors. These changing notions profoundly shaped both Jewish and Christian practices, provided a spur for the Protestant Reformation, and created a legacy that endures until today.</p>"

The result, both a compelling cultural history and a seminal survey of a major American art form.</p>"
Is There An Ethicist In The House?: On The Cutting Edge Of Bioethics,"['Moreno, Jonathan D.']","<p>In this timely book, Jonathan D. Moreno takes up some of the most important questions in clinical ethics today. Moreno’s view is that moral values emerge out of human experience, a view that creates a compelling conceptual framework for bioethics.</p>
<p>To begin, Moreno recalls his experience as a hospital ethicist and how that shaped his understanding of what bioethics is about, both as theory and practice. His focus then turns to a difficult moral paradox: the need to advance medical knowledge by using human beings in research. His account of the way American medicine has reached a strong protectionist approach to managing this paradox leads to discussions of vulnerable groups whose circumstances demand that we reflect on the way this issue should be approached in the future.</p>
<p>Moreno then takes up the historical and ethical role of the national security dimensions of human experimentation. His account casts a drastically different light on the origins of modern bioethics, especially on the central document of modern human experimentation, the Nuremberg Code.</p>
<p>In the last section, Moreno pushes the bioethics envelope in a naturalistic examination of emerging values concerning the neurosciences and bioterrorism.</p>
<p>Is There an Ethicist in the House? tackles difficult issues with clarity and insight. The book will be welcomed not only by medical professionals but also by lay readers who seek to understand the philosophical foundations of contemporary medical ethics.</p>"

Amazon Expeditions: My Quest For The Ice-age Equator,"['Colinvaux, Paul , 1930-']","<p>In this vivid memoir of a life in science, ecologist Paul Colinvaux takes his readers from the Alaskan tundra to steamy Amazon jungles, from the Galapagos Islands (before tourists had arrived) to the high Andes and the Darien Gap in Panama. He recounts an adventurous tale of exploration in the days before GPS and satellite mapping, and a tale no less exhilarating of his battle to disprove a hypothesis endorsed by most of the scientific community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colinvaux’s grand endeavor, begun in the 1960s, was to find fossil evidence of the ice-age climate and vegetation of the entire American equator, from Pacific to Atlantic. The accomplishment of the task by the author and his colleagues involved finding unknown ancient lakes, lugging drilling equipment through uncharted Amazon jungle, operating hand drills from rubber boats in water 40 meters deep, and inventing a pollen analysis for a land with 80,000 species of plants. Colinvaux’s years of arduous travel and research ultimately disproved a hotly defended hypothesis explaining bird distribution peculiarities in the Amazon forest. The story of how he arrived at a new understanding of the Amazon is at once an adventurous saga, an account of science as it is conducted in the field, and a cautionary tale about the temptation to treat a&nbsp; favored hypothesis with a reverence that subverts unbiased research.</p>

The Language Of Objects In The Art Of The Americas,['Edward J. Sullivan'],"<p>In this wide-ranging book, a distinguished scholar of Latin American art explores the meanings of created and depicted objects from the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking regions of the New World. Edward J. Sullivan begins with objects exchanged during encounters between indigenous peoples of the Americas and newly-arrived Europeans, and he pursues the discussion to the present day, as artists engage in breaking down constructed concepts of “Latin American-ness.” Sullivan’s scope is sweeping—the changing meanings of objects over five centuries—and he&nbsp;encourages deeper conversation about the complexities of today’s culture of the Americas.<br>
From American-made handicrafts displayed in Old World curiosity cabinets, to still life paintings projecting a Latin American nation’s proud self-image, to 20th-century “found objects” identified as works of art, objects from the Americas provide a wealth of cultural insights. This generously illustrated volume invites the reader to travel across time and national boundaries to examine an array of these extraordinary and meaningful objects.</p>"
The War Of Desire And Technology At The Close Of The Mechanical Age (the Mit Press),['Allucquère Rosanne Stone'],"<p>In this witty, far-reaching, and utterly original work, Allucquère Rosanne Stone examines the myriad ways modern technology is challenging traditional notions of gender identity.Face-to-face meetings, and even telephone conversations, involuntarily reveal crucial aspects of identity such as gender, age, and race. However, these bits of identity are completely masked by computer-mediated communications; all that is revealed is what we choose to reveal — and then only if we choose to tell the truth. The rise of computer-mediated communications is giving people the means to try on alternative personae — in a sense, to reinvent themselves — which, as Stone compellingly argues, has both positive and potentially destructive implications.Not a traditional text but rather a series of intellectual provocations, the book moves between fascinating accounts of the modern interface of technology and desire: from busy cyberlabs to the electronic solitude of the Internet, from phone sex to ""virtual cross-dressers,"" and from the trial of a man accused of having raped a woman by seducing one of her multiple personalities to the Vampire Lestat.Throughout, Stone wrestles with the question of how best to convey a complex description of a culture whose chief activity is complex description. Writing eloquently of creating a ""text that breaks rules,"" serving as a ""sampler of possible choices,"" she employs elements from a wide range of disciplines and genres, including cultural and critical theory, social sciences, pulp journalism, science fiction, and personal memoirs.Each chapter of the book can be read as a kind of performance piece, with its own individual voice and structure. In the final chapter, Stone threads the various narratives together, holding them in productive tension rather than attempting to collapse them into a single unifying statement: a process that best reflects the confused,ambiguous, and sometimes contradictory state of gender relations at the close of the mechanical age.</p>


                        <p>Not a traditional text but rather a series of intellectual provocations, this book moves between fascinating accounts of the modern interface of technology and desire--from busy cyberlabs to the electronic solitude of the Internet, from phone sex to ""virtual cross-dressers.""

Banished from Their Father's Table: Loss of Faith and Hebrew Autobiography,['Alan Mintz'],"<p>In this work of literary history and criticism, Alan Mintz details the development of a new mode in Hebrew prose narrative-the autobiography. Against the historical background of the Haskalah (Enlightenment), Mintz explores the work of three key writers: M. Z. Feierberg, M. Y. Berdichevsky, and Y. H. Brenner. At the turn of the century, these Hebrew writers found in autobiography a way of telling the truth about the realities of the self, its inner life, and its fate in a world void of God. Through careful examination of the Hebrew autobiographical tradition, Mintz provides not only new understanding of a literary genre but also access to a unique perspective on modern Jewish history.</p>"
Beyond Ego Psychology,"['Gertrude Blanck', 'Rubin Blanck']","<p>In this, the third volume in the acclaimed series on ego psychology, Rubin and Gertrude Blanck advance ego psychology beyond its position as a psychoanalytic developmental psychology, and present a developmental object relations theory.</p><p>In <i>Beyond Ego Psychololgy: Developmental Object Relations Theory</i> the authors remain, as always, firmly rooted in psychoanalytic theory while elaborating upon it. While their earlier work integrated the structural theory with the ego psychology that flowed from it, here they have extended Freud's concept of the <i>Gesamt Ich</i>, the ego as a whole, which they describe as superordinate to the ego of structure. Their work is distinctive because they add new dimensions to theory construction without discarding such basics as drive theory and conflict theory.</p><p>This new volume revives Freud's thoughts about object realations, and adds developmental theory to provide an integrated object relations theory. Object relations, the Blancks propose, arise out of the interaction between self and object representations and can be defined as the resultants of that interaction.</p><p>Extended also are the concept of transference, the manner in which the Oedipus Complex is resolved, and the technique of the termination process.</p><p><i>Beyond Ego Psychology</i> will be welcomed by readers of the first two books in this series, by psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and by a broad readership of professors and students in psychology, social work, and medicine.</p>"

"José, Can You See?: Latinos On And Off Broadway",['Alberto Sandoval-sanchez'],"<p>In two acts, complete with overture and intermission, Alberto Sandoval-Sánchez shines his spotlight on representations and stereotyping of Latinos on stage. In act one, <i>José Can You See?</i> scans the way Latinos get typecast on Broadway and in popular culture—from enduring icons like Carmen Miranda and Desi Arnaz to full-scale musicals like West Side Story and A Chorus Line.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In act two Sandoval-Sánchez offers a fresh perspective on how Latinos/as represent themselves in their own theatrical productions by introducing a whole body of relatively unknown Latino plays. Suggesting that all these plays pose a response to popular culture’s stereotypes, he discusses the ways in which Hispanic theater both confronts the dangers of assimilation and validates Latino traditions and culture.</p>

Motherself: A Mythic Analysis Of Motherhood,['Kathryn Allen Rabuzzi'],"<p>In Western cultures, the central image of the spiritual quest for selfhood is that of the mythic, male, hero. A male hero, however, represents the quest for selfhood incompletely and awkwardly for women. In this provocative work, Kathryn Rabuzzi focuses on a different image—that of the mother. For women seeking spiritual fulfillment of self, Rabuzzi points out the way of the mother, replacing the androcentric myths of the West with gynocentric myths based on the archetypal model of the Goddess.</p>
<p>In contrast to the selfhood for which the hero quests, ""motherself"" is the name for what women achieve when they follow the way of the mother. Rabuzzi defines that way with imagination and lucidity; her work provides an invaluable guide to all women struggling to articulate their religious experience in new terms.</p>

Indiana Blacks In The Twentieth Century (published With The Generous Support Of Lilly Endowment Inc),['Emma Lou Thornbrough'],"<p>Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century Emma Lou Thornbrough Edited and with a final chapter by Lana Ruegamer</p>
<p>Sequel to Thornbroug’s early groundbreaking study of African Americans.</p>
<p>Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century is the long-awaited sequel to Emma Lou Thornbrough’s classic study The Negro in Indiana before 1900. In this posthumous volume, Thornbrough (1913–1994), the acknowledged dean of black history in Indiana, chronicles the growth, both in numbers and in power, of African Americans in a northern state that was notable for its antiblack tradition. She shows the effects of the Great Migration of African Americans to Indiana during World War I and World War II to work in war industries, linking the growth of the black community to the increased segregation of the 1920s and demonstrating how World War II marked a turning point in the movement in Indiana to expand the civil rights of African Americans.</p>
<p>Indiana Blacks describes the impact of the national civil rights movement on Indiana, as young activists, both black and white, challenged segregation and racial injustice in many aspects of daily life, often in new organizations and with new leaders. The final chapter by Lana Ruegamer explores ways that black identity was affected by new access to education, work, and housing after 1970, demonstrating gains and losses from integration.</p>
<p>Emma Lou Thornbrough (1913–1994), the acknowledged expert on Indiana black history, was author of The Negro in Indiana before 1900: A Study of a Minority (1957, reprinted 1993) and Since Emancipation: A Short History of Indiana Negroes, 1863–1963 (1964) and editor of This Far by Faith: Black Hoosier Heritage (1982).

"H. H. Richardson: The Architect, His Peers, And Their Era",['Mit Prt'],"<p>introduction by William H. Pierson, Jr. In this book leading scholars reconsider the significance of the late nineteenth-century American architect Henry Hobson Richardson, perhaps best known for his design of Boston's Trinity Church. Against the long-held view of Richardson as an isolated and proto-modernist genius, they argue for a broader understanding of his work within the context of his times. Viewed this way, Richardson becomes a more challenging figure—an architect who in many ways was shaped by and was consistent with his era, even as he dominated it.Thomas C.</p>

All Silver And No Brass: An Irish Christmas Mumming,"['Glassie, Henry H.']","<p>Irish Christmas mumming, the subject of this carefully researched and beautifully written book, is approached in Part I through the recollections of four old people of the hamlet of Ballymenone who recall the mumming from their youth. In Part II, the author examines the form and function of the mummers' play, showing that—contrary to the theories of some folklorists—it is not a truncated fragment of a much larger whole but a complete ""presentational"" statement. He shows how the mummers' play functioned as a means of drawing the community closer together and as an expression of dangers and hopes in the potentially bitter Ulster situation.</p>
<p>Glassie's study treats fully the social and cultural context of the mummers' play. It is a superb study, of obvious value to folklorists, but also of interest to literary critics, literary historians, anthropologists, and others.</p>"

<p>Linda Dowling Almeida</p>
<p>The story of one of the most visible groups of immigrants in the major city of immigrants in the last half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>""Almeida offers a dynamic portrait of Irish New York, one that keeps reinventing itself under new circumstances.""<br>
—Hasia Diner, New York University</p>
<p>""[Almeida’s] close attention to changes in economics, culture, and politics on both sides of the Atlantic makes [this book] one of the more accomplished applications of the ‘new social history’ to a contemporary American ethnic group."" —Roger Daniels, University of Cincinnati</p>
<p>It is estimated that one in three New York City residents is an immigrant. No other American city has a population composed of so many different nationalities. Of these ""foreign born,"" a relatively small percentage come directly from Ireland, but the Irish presence in the city—and America—is ubiquitous. In the 1990 census, Irish ancestry was claimed by over half a million New Yorkers and by 44 million nationwide. The Irish presence in popular American culture has also been highly visible.</p>
<p>Yet for all the attention given to Irish Americans, surprisingly little has been said about post–World War II immigrants. Almeida’s research takes important steps toward understanding modern Irish immigration. Comparing 1950s Irish immigrants with the ""New Irish"" of the 1980s, Almeida provides insights into the evolution of the Irish American identity and addresses the role of the United States and Ireland in shaping it.</p>
<p>She finds, among other things, that social and economic progress in Ireland has heightened expectations for Irish immigrants. But at the same time they face greater challenges in gaining legal residence, a situation that has led the New Irish to reject many organizations that long supported previous generations of Irish immigrants in favor of new ones better-suited to their needs.</p>

"Human Cloning: Science, Ethics, And Public Policy","['Mackinnon', 'Barbara']","<p>Is human cloning a science fiction nightmare come true? Or is it a practical avenue toward beneficial new medical treatments and techniques?</p>
<p>In this concise volume, experts on all sides of the debate make arguments for why we should either pursue, regulate, or ban the cloning of human beings. Balancing scientific detail with philosophical argument, <i>Human Cloning</i> succinctly outlines what cloning is and is not (e.g., cloning does not produce identical individuals), what has led to recent scientific developments, what is now possible, and what ethical dilemmas cloning presents. Opponents claim that cloning subverts human dignity, makes a mockery of spousal love, and poses serious safety hazards. Proponents cite a range of potential benefits, such as producing transplant tissue that is less likely to be rejected, extending current techniques of artificial insemination, and controlling genetic abnormalities to prevent birth defects.</p>
<p>Cloning itself is not new, but as the science of cloning continues to advance--and as human cloning thus inches closer to reality--we are compelled to consider its implications for society. <i>Human Cloning</i> is a lucid, substantive guide to this contentious and potentially revolutionary issue.<br>

Constructing Public Opinion,['Justin Lewis'],"<p>Is polling a process that brings ""science"" into the study of society? Or are polls crude instruments that tell us little about the way people actually think? The role of public opinion polls in government and mass media has gained increasing importance with each new election or poll taken.</p>
<p>Here Lewis presents a new look at an old tradition, the first study of opinion polls using an interdisciplinary approach combining cultural studies, sociology, political science, and mass communication. Rather than dismissing polls, he considers them to be a significant form of representation in contemporary culture; he explores how the media report on polls and, in turn, how publicized results influence the way people respond to polls. Lewis argues that the media tend to exclude the more progressive side of popular opinion from public debate. While the media's influence is limited, it works strategically to maintain the power of pro-corporate political elites.</p>

Ascension: John Coltrane And His Quest,['Eric Nisenson'],"<p>It is the summer of 1976 and Salvo Ursari, a man of retirement age, is walking on a taut wire strung between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center, almost fourteen hundred feet above the city. Far below him in the gaping crowd stands his wife, Anna, to whom he has made a solemn promise: This wire walk will end his career. In this daring moment, Steven Galloway opens his riveting novel about Salvo Ursari, whose life begins in 1919 amid a Transylvanian boyhood inhabited by gypsy folklore and inspired by the bravery of his persecuted people. Salvo's story moves irresistibly from a tragic fire that envelops his family, to street life in Budapest, where he learns the skills of a wire walker, to the carnivals of Europe and the competitive world of the American circus. Most fulfilled when living with paradox, Salvo feels safest while performing startling feats of balance on a wire high above the dangerous world; and most endangered if performing above a net. With compassion, warmth, and blazing originality, Ascension combines jaw-dropping storytelling, and fantastical symbolism with mesmerizing detail of Romany and circus culture, and an unforgettable walk with the amazing Salvo Ursari.</p>


                        <p>Tenor saxophone player Coltrane was a pioneer of free-form jazz, a forerunner of today's world music, and one of the first artists to reflect society's tribulations through his art form--a true original. Nisenson explores the shadow Coltrane cast in this must-read for music fans. Selected discography.

Learning Race And Ethnicity: Youth And Digital Media,['Anna Everett'],"<p>It may have been true once that (as the famous cartoon of the 1990s put it)""Nobody knows you're a dog on the Internet,"" and that (as an MCI commercial of that era declared) on the Internet there is no race, gender, or infirmity, but today, with the development of web cams, digital photography, cell phone cameras, streaming video, and social networking sites,this notion seems quaintly idealistic. This volume takes up issues of race and ethnicity in the new digital media landscape. The contributors address this topic—still difficult to engage honestly,clearly, empathetically, and with informed understanding in twenty-first century America—with the goal of pushing consideration of a vexing but important subject from margin to center. Learning Race and Ethnicity explores the intersection of race and ethnicity with post 9/11 politics, online hate-speech practices, and digital youth and media cultures. It examines universal access and the racial and ethnic digital divide from the perspective of digital media learning and youth. The chapters treat such subjects as racial identity in the computer-mediated public sphere, minority technology innovators, new methods of music distribution, digital artist Judy Baca's work with youth, Native American digital media literacy, and minority youth technology access and the pervasiveness of online health information.

Kgb,['Martin Ebon'],"<p>It was official. In 1991, two months after an abortive coup in August, the KGB was pronounced dead. But was it really? In <i>KGB: Death and Rebirth</i>, Martin Ebon, a writer long engaged in the study of foreign affairs, maintains that the notorious secret police/espionage organization is alive and well. He takes a penetrating look at KGB predecessors, the KGB at the time of its supposed demise, and the subsequent use of segmented intelligence forces such as border patrols and communications and espionage agencies. Ebon points out that after the Ministry of Security resurrected these domestic KGB activities, Yevgeny Primakov's Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) assumed foreign policy positions not unlike its predecessor's. Even more important, Ebon argues, spin-off secret police organizations--some still bearing the KGB name--have surfaced, wielding significant power in former Soviet republics, from the Ukraine to Kazakhstan, from Latvia to Georgia.</p><p>How did the new KGB evolve? Who were the individuals responsible for recreating the KGB in its new image? What was the KGB's relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev during his regime? Did Boris Yeltsin plan a Russian KGB, even before the August coup? What has been the role of KGB successor agencies within the independence movements in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia? How has Yevgeny Primakov influenced foreign intelligence activity? What is the role of the FIS in Iran? What does the future hold? Martin Ebon meets these provocative questions head-on, offering candid, often surprising answers and new information for the curious--or concerned--reader. While the Cold War is over, Ebon cautions, the KGB has retained its basic structure and goals under a new name, and it would be naive to believe otherwise.</p>"
A Producer's Broadway Journey,['Stuart Ostrow'],"<p>It would be difficult, indeed, to imagine anyone more qualified to give us a celebration, from the perspective of an insider, of the Broadway musical. From the first run of <i>Guys and Dolls</i> in 1950 to the recent debut of <i>Rent</i>, Stuart Ostrow, a protégé of the great composer-lyricist Frank Loesser, has been personally involved in many of the major Broadway productions of our time. The steadily growing number of fans of the Great White Way will delight in his reminiscences about the shows that have shaped musical theater, such as <i>Hello Dolly</i>, <i>Funny Girl</i>, <i>Man of LaMancha</i>, <i>Cabaret</i>, <i>1776</i>, and <i>M. Butterfly</i>—to name just a few.</p>
<p>Readers of <i>A Producer's Broadway Journey</i> will certainly be entertained by Ostrow's behind-the-scenes anecdotes of Bob Fosse, Barbra Streisand, Betty Buckley, Cole Porter, Lerner and Loewe, Hal Prince, Ethel Merman, and many other legends encountered in his accomplished career. But in addition to the tales or re-writes, stand-ins, near-disasters, and moments of theatrical magic, the author also provides a unique historical perspective on almost half a century of the musical.</p>"
"Richard Nixon, Watergate, And The Press: A Historical Retrospective",['Louis W. Liebovich'],"<p>It's time to revisit Watergate. In this compelling reexamination, Liebovich draws extensively from newly available sources, including recently released Nixon Oval Office tapes, FBI reports, and personal reminiscences of cover-up leader John Dean. Liebovich sheds new light on the Nixon administration's extensive foul play, zeal to battle and manipulate the press, scandalous miring, and eventual political disgrace. After detailing the nation's news media coverage of the Watergate debacle and the ensuing breakup of American politics, Liebovich recounts the scandal's long-lasting, corrosive effect on presidential and popular politics.</p>
<p>Scholars and students of the media and latter-20th-century American political malaise will be provoked and persuaded by Liebovich's argument that much of the public's cynicism toward the press, the president, and politics stems from the bitter battles-fought in the White House, on the front pages, and on television screens-between the press and Nixon's administration. The book focuses on the fight against a press perceived as hostile to the President and charts how the nation's major newspapers and magazines covered the unfolding scandal. Newly released sources show how Nixon and his advisors immersed themselves so deeply in a maze of deception and mistrust that none involved could extricate themselves, creating a political tragedy that haunts us to this day.</p>"
Ivan The Terrible,['Isabel De Madariaga'],"<p>Ivan IV, ""the Terrible” (15331584), is one of the key figures in Russian history, yet he has remained among the most neglected. Notorious for pioneering a policy of unrestrained terror—and for killing his own son—he has been credited with establishing autocracy in Russia. This is the first attempt to write a biography of Ivan from birth to death, to study his policies, his marriages, his atrocities, and his disordered personality, and to link them as a coherent whole.<br>
Isabel de Madariaga situates Ivan within the background of Russian political developments in the sixteenth century. And, with revealing comparisons with English, Spanish, and other European courts, she sets him within the international context of his time. The biography includes a new account of the role of astrology and magic at Ivan’s court and provides fresh insights into his foreign policy. Facing up to problems of authenticity (much of Ivan’s archive was destroyed by fire in 1626) and controversies which have paralyzed western scholarship, de Madariaga seeks to present Russia as viewed from the Kremlin rather than from abroad and to comprehend the full tragedy of Ivan’s reign.</p>"
The new conservatism: cultural criticism and the historians' debate,"['Habermas, Jürgen.']","<p>Jürgen Habermas is well known for his scholarly works on the theoretical foundations of the human sciences. The New Conservatism brings to light another side of Habermas's talents,showing him as an incisive commentator on a wide range of contemporary themes.The 1980s have been a crucial decade in the political life of the Federal Republic of Germany. The transformations that accompanied a shift from 13 years of Social Democratic rule to government by the conservative Christian Democrats are captured in this series of insightful, often passionate political and cultural commentaries. The central theme uniting the essays is the German problem of ""coming to terms with the past,"" a problem that has important implications outside Germany as well.Of particular note are the essays on what has come to be known as the Historians' Debate: Habermas's attack on the revisionist German historians who have been trying to trivialize and ""normalize"" the history of the Nazi period, and his defense of the need for a realistic and discriminating coining to terms with the past in Germany. Habermas also takes up the recent fracas concerning Martin Heidegger's involvement with Nazism and the rise of the neoconservative movement in Europe and America. In particular, the essay on ""The New Obscurity"" combines Habermas's analysis of the problems of the welfare state with his suggestions for avenues open to utopian impulses today.Jürgen Habermas is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Frankfurt. The New Conservatism is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought, edited by Thomas McCarthy.</p>"
The Time And Place That Gave Me Life,['Janet C. Bell'],"<p>Janet Cheatham Bell's riveting memoir recounts her experiences coming of age as an African American girl in Indianapolis during the 1930s to the mid-1960s. In taut chapters, Bell introduces the reader to a life defined largely by race and racial discrimination. She begins with her birth in 1937 and her parents' early struggles after relocating to Indianapolis from Tennessee. Bell describes her first job as a maid in a wealthy white household and her humiliating experiences at a ""white"" high school. She describes experiences of racism at Indiana University and how she copes with personal tragedy that she is able to overcome. Devoid of hyperbole or the trauma that defines so many memoirs, particularly those of celebrities, the strength and appeal of Bell's memoir lies in her direct, but personal tone, and her deft use of anecdotes. ""I think of myself as ordinary,"" writes Bell, ""but the lives of ordinary people are not identical, and the details of those lives are worth knowing.""</p>"
Jelly's blues,"['Howard Reich', 'William Gaines']","<p>Jelly's Blues vividly recounts the tumultuous life of Jelly Roll Morton (1890-1941), born Ferdinand Joseph Lamonthe to a large, extended family in New Orleans. A virtuoso pianist with a larger-than-life personality, he composed such influential early jazz pieces as Kansas City Stomp and New Orleans Blues. But by the late 1930s, Jelly Roll Morton was nearly forgotten as a visionary jazz composer. Instead, he was caricatured as a braggart, a hustler, and, worst of all, a has-been. He was ridiculed by the white popular press and robbed of due royalties by unscrupulous music publishers. His reputation at rock bottom, Jelly Roll Morton seemed destined to be remembered more as a flamboyant, diamond-toothed rounder than as the brilliant architect of that new American musical idiom: Jazz.In 1992, the death of a New Orleans memorabilia collector unearthed a startling archive. Here were unknown later compositions as well as correspondence, court and copyright records, all detailing Morton's struggle to salvage his reputation, recover lost royalties, and protect the publishing rights of black musicians. Morton was a much more complex and passionate man than many had realized, fiercely dedicated to his art and possessing an unwavering belief in his own genius, even as he toiled in poverty and obscurity. An especially immediate and visceral look into the jazz worlds of New Orleans and Chicago, Jelly's Blues is the definitive biography of a jazz icon, and a long overdue look at one of the twentieth century's most important composers.</p>"
"Selling Jerusalem: Relics, Replicas, Theme Parks",['Annabel Jane Wharton'],"<p>Jerusalem currently stands at the center of a violent controversy that threatens the stability of both the Middle East and the world. This volatility, observes Annabel Jane&nbsp;Wharton, is only the most recent manifestation of a centuries-old obsession with the control of the Holy City—military occupation and pilgrimage being two familiar forms of “ownership.” Wharton makes the innovative argument here that the West has also sought to possess Jerusalem by acquiring its representations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From relics of the True Cross and Templar replicas of the Holy Sepulchre to Franciscan recreations of the Passion to nineteenth-century mass-produced prints and contemporary theme parks, Wharton describes the evolving forms by which the city has been possessed in the West. She also maps those changing embodiments of the Holy City against shifts in the western market. From the gift-and-barter economy of the early Middle Ages to contemporary globalization, both money and the representations of Jerusalem have become progressively incorporeal, abstract, illusionistic, and virtual.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Selling Jerusalem</i> offers a penetrating introduction to the explosive combination of piety and capital at work in religious objects and global politics. It is sure to interest students and scholars of art history, economic history, popular culture, religion, and architecture, as well as those who want to better understand Jerusalem’s problematic place in history.</p>"
"Dynomite!: Good Times, Bad Times, Our Times--a Memoir",['Jimmie Walker'],"<p>Jimmie Walker was raised in a violent and abusive home in the Bronx. Starting in small clubs and eventually opening for Black Panther rallies, he ultimately became an icon playing J. J. Evans on <i>Good Times</i>. Walker was the first successful young black sitcom star, and his catchphrase—“Dyn-o-mite!”—remains an indicator of the era. He saw sudden and enormous fame in everything from comic books and a talking doll to pajamas, trading cards, a bestselling album, and <i>TV Guide</i> covers. In <i>Dyn-o-mite!</i>, Walker candidly talks about his rise and the considerable tensions on the set of <i>Good Times</i> that contradicted the show’s image of a close-knit, blue-collar family struggling to survive in the projects.</p>
<p> Walker made “Dyn-o-mite!” a catchword for the Baby Boomer generation. Today, <i>Dyn-o-mite!</i> will inspire that same generation to rediscover what once made America great—the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech, and the belief in the individual.</p>"

Power And Peace: The Diplomacy Of John Foster Dulles,"['Marks, Frederick W.']","<p>John Foster Dulles' reputation among diplomatic historians has been at a low ebb for many years. The fact that it is only now beginning to show signs of recovery is surprising considering that his modus operandi, coupled with a public style that concealed as much as it revealed, enabled him to gain the respect of hundreds of overseas officials, including those of the USSR. The cutting edge of an extraordinarily subtle and complex mind made it possible for him to lead the United States through eight years of unparalleled peace and prosperity. Nevertheless, the strategy and tactics behind such a record have escaped notice, especially in academia, where he is still subject to varying degrees of caricature. Not since 1973 has any full-length study dealt in any comprehensive way with Dulles as secretary of state even though a steady stream of fresh source material has become available during the interim.</p>
<p>Power and Peace offers the first analysis of Dulles' operational plan across the board. It is also unique for the type of linkage that is uncovered between different issues in different parts of the world. Beyond this, on the basis of research notable for breadth as well as depth in key areas, it differentiates Dulles from Eisenhower, showing that, contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the former who generally took the lead on policy matters. It indicates that Dulles was capable of weighing in heavily on the side of non-intervention and hence was no more of a hawk than Ike. It also unveils important differences of opinion separating the secretary from his boss. Professor Marks presents some of the most crucial episodes in an entirely new light--for instance the Dien Bien Phu crisis, Western European union, intervention in Guatemala, and Dulles' indispensable work on behalf of Austrian freedom, work that has yet to receive even minimal recognition. Finally, Marks explores the intellectual side of the secretary, something once again neglected but nonetheless essential since Dulles, of all American statesman next to John Quincy Adams, was a thinker. In a nutshell, Marks puts the case that far from being the personification of the Cold War mentality, as he is so often portrayed on the basis of his rhetoric, Dulles was eminently flexible behind the scenes and about as pragmatic as it was possible to be at a time of rampant McCarthyism. Working alongside Eisenhower, he inaugurated the first era of Soviet-American detente: and it is in this light, Marks argues, that Dulles is best understood, as well as most worthy of remembrance.</p>"

John Sloan's New York (delaware Art Museum),"['Joyce K. Schiller', 'Heather Campbell Coyle', 'Molly S. Hutton', 'Susan Fillin-yeh', 'Katherine E. Manthorne', 'Alexis L. Boylan']","<p>John Sloan (18711951) began his career as a commercial newspaper artist in Philadelphia where he studied with Robert Henri. Following Henri to New York, Sloan joined a small circle of eight talented artists whose dissatisfaction with the dominating National Academy led to a protest exhibit in 1908, the emergence of a powerful movement for change in American art, and ultimately to the famous Armory Show of 1913. It was in part Sloan’s dark palette and views of city streets and working-class life that gave rise to the epithet now used to describe the works of the ""Ashcan School.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sloan’s compelling images of New York City are the subject of this generously illustrated book. His paintings, drawings, and prints clearly reflect his own experience of the city as he walked its neighborhoods and observed human dramas played out in streets and apartments. The contributors to the volume investigate a variety of topics, including Sloan’s understanding of the urban experience in America, his interest in social reform, his fascination with moving pictures and cinema aesthetics, and his relationship with Henri. The authors also situate Sloan’s paintings within the geography and social fabric of New York.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>John Sloan’s New York</i> presents a unique perspective on New York and its people and also on the artist himself, who was captivated by the soul of the city.</p>

Holding Fast/pressing On: Religion In America In The 1980s (contributions To The Study Of Religion),['Erling T. Jorstad'],"<p>Jorstad has written the first comprehensive history of American religion in the past decade. Drawing on many contemporary sources, he divides religion in the Eighties into three sections, each characterized by its own struggle. Mainline churches are largely involved in identity crises and social issues. Evangelicals are confronting scandals, politics, and the pressures of the mass media. Private seekers, which the author sees as the wave of the future, swing between quietistic New Age philosophies and the desire for world transformation. Everywhere the tension is between the conservatives holding fast and the liberals pressing on. While Jorstad clearly sympathizes with the latter, he presents a balanced picture of recent religious history. An excellent work of social and historical analysis with insights for the future. Recommended for academic and public libraries. <i>Library Journal</i></p>
<p>During the 1980s, some of the most far-reaching and dramatic changes in American life were those occurring in religious life. Battles over abortion, televangelist morality scandals, responding to AIDS, gender issues, and American political policy toward South Africa are just a few of the major issues that made front-page news. This comprehensive history of American religion in the 1980s explores these and other issues, beginning with their historical background in the great awakening of the 1960s counterculture. It proceeds to trace the contours of the holders fast/pressers on battle (conservatives vs. moderates and liberals) in three areas: mainline struggles over denominational identity, social gospel outreach, and gender issues; evangelical struggles over involvement in office-seeking politics, televangelist morality, and popularization of traditional teaching; and privatized seeking of fulfillment through personal relationships, inner spiritual growth, and pursuit of the promises of New Age transformations of self and society. Using contemporary writings, interviews, reports, and other primary documents of the times as well as drawing on the interpretations of specialists in contemporary religious life, Jorstad throroughly explores every aspect of the themes covered.</p>
<p>In Part I, the book focuses on mainliners, documenting the decline of ecumenical energy and the sources and results of the fierce internal battles within mainline denominations over holding to older identities at the expense of extensive involvement in the major social crises of the day. Within the evangelical/fundamental section, the book examines the effects of the Falwells, Robertsons, and others in elective national politics and to what extent this movement depended on the leadership in the White House. EvangelisM's expression through and use of mass media is also addressed. The third major trend, privatization (largely New Age), is examined with attention to how seekers sought fulfillment through improving the quality of their relationships with partner, spouse, family, friends, and local community. The leadership of such interpreters as Scott Peck, James Dobson, Charles Swindoll, and Robert Schuller is also examined in detail. The final chapter explores the history, spread, and impact of New Age faith on the religious expression of the 1980s. <i>Holding Fast/Pressing On</i> is the first full-length account of the major developments of religion during the decade. It breaks new ground in using sociological theory to interpret the importance of the search for the self and will be of interest to students of American religious history and life, contemporary social trends and problems, and mass media, politics and religion.</p>"
Fred Astaire (icons Of America),['Joseph Epstein'],"<p>Joseph Epstein’s <i>Fred Astaire</i> investigates the great dancer’s magical talent, taking up the story of his life, his personality, his work habits, his modest pretensions, and above all his accomplishments. Written with the wit and grace the subject deserves, <i>Fred Astaire</i> provides a remarkable portrait of this extraordinary artist and how he came to embody for Americans a fantasy of easy elegance and, paradoxically, of democratic aristocracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracing Astaire’s life from his birth in Omaha to his death in his late eighties in Hollywood, the book discusses his early days with his talented and outspoken sister Adele, his gifts as a singer (Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Jerome Kern all delighted in composing for Astaire), and his many movie dance partners, among them Cyd Charisse, Rita Hayworth, Eleanor Powell, and Betty Hutton. A key chapter of the book is devoted to Astaire’s somewhat unwilling partnership with Ginger Rogers, the woman with whom he danced most dazzlingly. What emerges from these pages is a fascinating view of an American era, seen through the accomplishments of Fred Astaire, an unassuming but uncompromising performer who transformed entertainment into art and gave America a new yet enduring standard for style.</p>

Shakespeare's Reparative Comedies: A Psychoanalytic View Of The Middle Plays,"['Westlund, Joseph.']","<p>Joseph Westlund brings recent developments in psychoanalytic thought to his elegant and sensitive readings of Shakespeare's <i>Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, All's Well That Ends Well</i>, and <i>Measure for Measure</i>. Westlund departs from the usual preoccupation in psychoanalytic criticism with conflict and guilt to rely instead on Melanie Klein's theory of reparation, which emphasizes the impulse in life to resolve and transcend conflict. Through interpretations that are new and convincing, Westlund views the interactions of characters in the six comedies as attempts to work through anger and guilt to effect reparations for themselves and for us.</p>"
Julien Levy: Portrait Of An Art Gallery,['Lisa Jacobs'],"<p>Julien Levy (1906-1981) was one of the most influential art dealers of the twentieth century. The Julien Levy Gallery, which opened in New York in 1931 and closed in 1949, played an essential role in the shift of the cultural avant-garde from Paris to New York. It was the first American gallery to sponsor a show on Surrealism and to champion Neoromanticism, Magic Realism, and Machine Abstraction. Luis Buñuel's film Un Chien Andalou and Joseph Cornell's Rose Hobart were first screened in the gallery. Among the artists Levy exhibited were Eugene Atget, Constantin Brancusi,Henri Cartier-Bresson, Joseph Cornell, Salvador Dali, Walt Disney, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Walker Evans, Leonor Fini, Naum Gabo, Alberto Giacometti, Arshile Gorky, Frida Kahlo, Fernand Léger, RenéMagritte, Lee Miller, Man Ray, Ben Shahn, and Dorothea Tanning. Levy also initiated the cocktail opening.This book, which accompanies a retrospective exhibition on the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, includes reproductions of paintings, photographs, and film stills from museum and private collections, as well as of art and ephemera from Levy's own collection. The book offers recollections of Levy and his gallery from several angles. Dorothea Tanning reminisces about her lifelong friendship with her first dealer. Ingrid Schaffner surveys the evolution of Levy's enterprise from combination curiosity shop, exhibition space, and performance site into a model for the contemporary art gallery. Steven Watson discusses Levy's personal and professional affiliations with the ""Harvard Moderns""—Alfred Barr, Jr., and A. Everett Austin among them. Carolyn Burke looks at Levy's complex relationship with his mother-in-law, poet and painter Mina Loy, who acted as his agent and mentor in Paris. Finally, Lisa Jacobs provides a chronology of the events of the gallery and of Levy's life.Published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Equitable Gallery, New York.</p>"
Eye Of The Storm,['Jeffrey Rosenfeld'],"<p>June marks the official beginning of the American hurricane season, yet by early May, we were already witness to the devastation that Mother Nature wrought in Oklahoma and Kansas. What causes these tremendous storms which result in such massive amounts of loss of life and property alike? What ignites those terrifying bolts of lightning that shoot down from the heavens during tornadoes? What sparks those torrential downpours that flood towns in a matter of minutes?In <i>Eye of the Storm: Inside the World’s Deadliest Hurricanes, Tornadoes, and Blizzards</i>, science journalist Jeffrey Rosenfeld takes us on a whirlwind adventure through the world’s deadliest storms, answering these questions and many more.While just a century ago thunder, lightning, and snow were considered solely acts of divine intervention, meteorologists today try to grasp and even recreate the magic of stormy weather. Flying through 200 M.P.H. hurricanes with winds pummeling their planes and chasing tornadoes across the desolate desert, they risk their lives to get closer to these unbridled forces. Now in this unprecedented work, Rosenfeld follows these brave scientists into the eye of the storm, eloquently explaining the science behind snowflakes, hail, and even the ghostly glow emanating from inside tornadoes.Moreover, as we journey through the awe-inspiring history of storm science, we meet the true heroes of the quest to understand the weather—the scientists, from Ben Franklin to today’s computer modelers, whose acumen, daring and ingenuity have allowed them to see the uncharted realm of the clouds.Illuminating and highly entertaining, <i>Eye of the Storm</i> reveals that behind the power of the tumultuous heavens there lies a majestic, yet deadly, beauty. We see past the chaos and destruction and witness the grace of hidden patterns in the swirling wind and blinding rain. After reading this engrossing, turbulent saga of bravery, creativity, danger, and intrigue, you’ll never look at a storm the same way again.</p>"

Cruise O’Brien has been described as “a man who so persistently asks the right questions” (<i>The Economist</i>), and in this, his last book, he explores the question of how early America’s future was determined.</p>
<p><i>First in Peace</i> considers the dissension between Washington and Jefferson during the first U.S. presidency, and reveals Washington’s clear-sighted political wisdom while exposing Jefferson’s dangerous ideology. Cruise O’Brien makes the case that Washington, not Jefferson, was the true democrat, and commends his clarity of vision in restoring good relations with Britain, his preference for order and pragmatism, and his aversion to French political extremism.</p>"
Confronting History: A Memoir (george L. Mosse Series In Modern European Cultural And Intellectual History),['George L. Mosse'],"<p>Just two weeks before his death in January 1999, George L. Mosse, one of this century’s great historians, finished writing his memoir, a fascinating and fluent account of a remarkable life that spanned three continents and many of the major events of the twentieth century. Writing about the events of his life through a historian’s lens, Mosse gives us a personal history of our century. This is a story told with the clarity, passion, and verve that entranced thousands of Mosse’s students and that countless readers have found, and will continue to find, in his many scholarly books.</p>
<p>Confronting History describes Mosse’s opulent childhood in Weimar Berlin; his exile in Paris and England, including boarding school and study at Cambridge University; his second exile in the U.S. at Haverford, Harvard, Iowa, and Wisconsin; and his extended stays in London and Jerusalem. Mosse also deals with matters of personal identity. He discusses being a Jew and his attachment to Israel and Zionism. He addresses his gayness, his coming out, and his growing scholarly interest in issues of sexuality.</p>
<p>This touching memoir, sometimes harrowing, often humorous, is guided in part by Mosse’s belief that “what man is, only history tells,” and by his constant themes of the fate of liberalism, the defining events that can bring about the generational political awakenings of youth (from the anti-fascism struggles of the 1930s to the campus anti-war movement of the 1960s), the meanings of masculinity and racial and sexual stereotypes, the enigma of exile, and—most of all—the importance of finding one’s self through the pursuit of truth, and through an honest and unflinching analysis of one’s place in the context of his times.</p>"
"Arbitrary And Capricious: The Supreme Court, The Constitution, And The Death Penalty","['Foley, Michael A.']","<p>Justice Marshall once remarked that if people knew what he knew about the death penalty, they would reject it overwhelmingly. Foley elucidates Marshall's claim that fundamental flaws exist in the implementation of the death penalty. He guides us through the history of the Supreme Court's death penalty decisions, revealing a constitutional quagmire the Court must navigate to avoid violating the fundamental tenant of equal justice for all.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 influential Supreme Court capital punishment-related cases from 1878-2002 are examined, beginning with <i>Wilkerson v. Utah</i>, which question not the legitimacy of capital punishment, but the methods of execution. Over time, focus shifted from the constitutionality of certain methods to the fairness of who was being sentenced for capital crimes—and why. The watershed 1972 ruling <i>Furman v. Georgia</i> reversed the Court's stand on capital punishment, holding that the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore unconstitutional. Furman clarified that any new death penalty legislation must contain sentencing procedures that avoid the arbitrary infliction of a life-ending verdict, which led to the current complex tangle of issues surrounding the death penalty and its constitutional viability.</p>"
Balls And Strikes: The Money Game In Professional Baseball,['Kenneth M. Jennings'],"<p>Kenneth M. Jennings examines union-management relations in professional baseball, bringing together all the information the sports fan needs to follow the issues surrounding player-management arbitration in this unique industry. Covering the history of collective bargaining action in baseball from 1869 to the 1990 season, this book examines the issues that influence those high-profile player-management-owner negotiations. Balls and Strikes reveals: how in recent years the Major League Baseball Players' Association (MLBPA) has successfully parlayed owner disunity into substantial gains for its members; that baseball, in a statistical sense, surprisingly exhibits little discrimination against black and Hispanic players; how there is very little relationship between pay and performance in professional baseball. Baseball fans and sports journalists as well as professionals in management and labor relations, will find Balls and Strikes a fresh and exciting look at America's favorite pastime. Balls and Strikes presents the confrontations and relationships between players and management from the perspective of several hundred collective bargaining participants--the union and management officials who negotiate the labor agreement and the players who must approve and live with it. Kenneth M. Jennings derives his perspective from a variety of media sources, related biographies, autobiographies, and articles. The result is a highly readable book about owners, commissioners, agents, the media, manager-player relations, player pressures including drug and alcohol problems, race and ethnic issues, and player mobility and salaries. The book discusses the history of collective bargaining actionin baseball from 1869 to 1966; the year Marvin Miller became president of the MLBPA, through the 1970s and Miller's successful bargaining efforts, into the 1980s and the opening of the 1990 season. Balls and Strikes discusses key participants in the collective bargaining process--owners, agents, the media, managers, and players--and concludes with a look at contemporary industrial relations issues in professional baseball: drug and alcohol abuse; racial discrimination; and the relationship between pay and performance.</p>"
"Soviet And Kosher: Jewish Popular Culture In The Soviet Union, 1923-1939",['Anna Shternshis'],"<p>Kosher pork—an oxymoron? Anna Shternshis’s fascinating study traces the creation of a Soviet Jewish identity that disassociated Jewishness from Judaism. The cultural transformation of Soviet Jews between 1917 and 1941 was one of the most ambitious experiments in social engineering of the past century. During this period, Russian Jews went from relative isolation to being highly integrated into the new Soviet culture and society, while retaining a strong ethnic and cultural identity. This identity took shape during the 1920s and 1930s, when the government attempted to create a new Jewish culture, ""national in form"" and ""socialist in content."" Soviet and Kosher is the first study of key Yiddish documents that brought these Soviet messages to Jews, notably the ""Red Haggadah,"" a Soviet parody of the traditional Passover manual; songs about Lenin and Stalin; scripts from regional theaters; Socialist Realist fiction; and magazines for children and adults. More than 200 interviews conducted by the author in Russia, Germany, and the United States testify to the reception of these cultural products and provide a unique portrait of the cultural life of the average Soviet Jew.</p>"
Who owns America?: social conflict over property rights,"['Jacobs', 'Harvey M.']","<p>Land ownership by individual citizens is a cornerstone of American heritage and a centerpiece of the American dream. Thomas Jefferson called it the key to our success as a democracy. Yet the question of who owns America not only remains unanswered but is central to a fundamental conflict that can pit private property rights advocates against government policymakers and environmentalists.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land use authority Harvey M. Jacobs has gathered a provocative collection of perspectives from eighteen contributors in the fields of law, history, anthropology, economics, sociology, forestry, and environmental studies. <i>Who Owns America?</i> begins with the popular view of land ownership as seen though the television show <i>Bonanza!</i> It examines public regulation of private land; public land management; the roles culture and ethnic values play in land use; and concludes with Jacobs’ title essay.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Who Owns America?</i> is a powerful and illuminating exploration of the very terrain that makes us Americans. Its broad set of theoretical and historical perspectives will fascinate historians, environmental activists, policy makers, and all who care deeply about the land we share.</p>"
Modern Organizations Of Vocational Education,['Angelo  C. Gilli'],"<p>Leaders in vocational education, according to this book, combine the fundamentals of their subject with elements of organization theory and concepts of leadership. These ""blended"" principles of successful vocational education are examined in Part I. The ten components of the vocational education delivery system are analyzed in Part II in the light of principles developed in Part I. Academic institutions, public and private, from secondary schools to universities, are considered, as are industrial training and governmental manpower programs. The unique aspects of each kind of organization are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, in terms of student enrollments, graduates' careers, faculties, curriculums, governance, financing, and relations with the community.</p>
<p>Four developments in vocational education receive special attention. First is the universal college concept, which delays the specialized portion of a student's vocational training until he or she has accepted a specific job. Second is the dual delivery system, which gives as much emphasis to adult and continuing education as to the preparation of neophyte workers (funding via such revenue sharing devices as those of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 are important here.) Third is the shift in governance from state and local to regional units (a harbinger of this trend is the prime sponsor concept embodied n the CETA of 1973). Fourth is the growth of post-secondary vocational education, largely via area vocational schools and community junior colleges. Part III examines where vocational education is, advocates what it could be, and predicts what it likely will be in 1980 and beyond.</p>
<p>Dr. Gilli's ideal model starts with the identification of ""clusterable"" personal goals among students; employs personalized teaching to identified occupational families and their characteristics; and utilizes skill centers to impart contracted-for skills from both academic and vocational subject matter. His forecast is guardedly optimistic; foreseeing neither a boom nor a bust in vocational education, he recommends substantial changes as a hedge against inflated criticism.</p>"
"The History Of British Art, Vol. 3: 1870-now","['David Bindman', 'Chris Stephens']","<p>Leading authorities explore the transition from the High Victorian period to the counterculture of the 1960s and the Young British Artists of the 1990s.

By Sea And By River: The Naval History Of The Civil War (da Capo Paperback),['Bern Anderson'],"<p>Less bloody and less known than the land campaigns of the Civil War, the naval battles—and especially the naval blockade of the South—were crucial factors in the outcome of the war. The spectacular battle between the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimack</i> marked the debut of ironclads, a revolution in naval warfare. Ships supported McClellan’s Peninsula Campaign and Grant’s conquest of the Mississippi Valley. The raiding of the Confederate cruisers <i>Sumter, Florida,</i> and <i>Alabama,</i> Farragut’s capture of the forts in Mobile Bay, and the interception of foreign ships on their way to trade with the South all led to the North’s eventual triumph. Bern Anderson, a retired admiral, provides sketches of many of the leading characters in the action: Gideon Welles, David Farragut, Stephen Mallory, Andrew Foote, and the Confederate commander Raphael Semmes. Anderson delineates the new kind of war being born in the rivers and oceans of the U.S. during these years, in this first effective joint action by military and naval forces in American history.</p>"
Viva Baseball!: Latin Major Leaguers And Their Special Hunger (sport And Society),['Samuel O. Regalado'],"<p>Lively and anecdotal, <i>Viva Baseball!</i> chronicles the struggles of Latin American professional baseball players in the United States from the late 1800s to the present. Even as ""Fernandomania"" raged in 1981, most Latin players felt lonely, shunned, and forgotten. Samuel O. Regalado reveals the shocking racism faced by these immigrant athletes in a white culture. In addition to mining the National Baseball Library in Cooperstown, New York, and the <i>Sporting News</i> archives, Regalado conducted interviews with some twenty-five Latin baseball stars, including Felipe Alou, Orlando Cepeda, and Tony Oliva.</p>"
"Nancy Cunard: Heiress, Muse, Political Idealist",['Lois Gordon'],"<p>Lois Gordon's absorbing biography tells the story of a writer, activist, and cultural icon who embodied the dazzling energy and tumultuous spirit of her age, and whom William Carlos Williams once called ""one of the major phenomena of history.""</p>
<p>Nancy Cunard (1896-1965) led a life that surpasses Hollywood fantasy. The only child of an English baronet (and heir to the Cunard shipping fortune) and an American beauty, Cunard abandoned the world of a celebrated socialite and Jazz Age icon to pursue a lifelong battle against social injustice as a wartime journalist, humanitarian aid worker, and civil rights champion.</p>
<p>Cunard fought fascism on the battlefields of Spain and reported firsthand on the atrocities of the French concentration camps. Intelligent and beautiful, she romanced the great writers of her era, including three Nobel Prize winners, and was the inspiration for characters in the works of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Pablo Neruda, Samuel Beckett, and Ernest Hemingway, among others.</p>
<p>Cunard was also a prolific poet, publisher, and translator and, after falling in love with a black American jazz pianist, became deeply committed to fighting for black rights. She edited the controversial anthology <i>Negro</i>, the first comprehensive study of the achievement and plight of blacks around the world. Her contributors included Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Zora Neale Hurston, among scores of others.</p>
<p>Cunard's personal life was as complex as her public persona. Her involvement with the civil rights movement led her to be ridiculed and rejected by both family and friends. Throughout her life, she was plagued by insecurities and suffered a series of breakdowns, struggling with a sense of guilt over her promiscuous behavior and her ability to survive so much war and tragedy. Yet Cunard's writings also reveal an immense kindness and wit, as well as her renowned, often flamboyant defiance of prejudiced social conventions.</p>
<p>Drawing on diaries, correspondence, historical accounts, and the remembrances of others, Lois Gordon revisits the major movements of the first half of the twentieth century through the life of a truly gifted and extraordinary woman. She also returns Nancy Cunard to her rightful place as a major figure in the historical, social, and artistic events of a critical era.</p>

London In The Age Of Shakespeare,['Lawrence Manley'],"<p>London in the age of Shakespeare was one of the largest and most important cities of Europe. Poets and poetasters, rhetoricians, and preachers were able to use the city as an object for displays of technical rhetoric in ballads, bawdy jests, sermons, and tales. There is today an unparalleled wealth of contemporary descriptions which give us a vivid picture of what life was like in London in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>Professor Manley has collected a rich variety of such documents on Shakespeare's London, many of which have never before been translated into English. He has provided a general introduction to the history and literature of Tudor-Stuart London, while in further introductions to each chapter he sets the selections in their historical context and explains the conventions of literary genre that must be considered in using the selections as historical evidence.</p>
<p>This collection will be welcomed by those interested in Renaissance history and life, and will be a useful resource for students of Renaissance poetry and rhetoric.</p>"

"Colin Powell And Condoleezza Rice: Foreign Policy, Race, And The New American Century","['Lusane, Clarence , 1953-']","<p>Lusane has created a groundbreaking analysis of the intersection of racial politics and American foreign policy. This insightful work critically examines the roles played by former Secretary of State Colin Powell and current Secretary of State (and former National Security Advisor) Condoleezza Rice in the construction of U.S. foreign policy, exploring the ways in which their racial identity challenges conventional notions about the role of race in international relations.</p>
<p>Neither Powell nor Rice consciously allowed their racial identity to substantially influence or characterize their participation in the defense and projection of U.S. hegemony, Lusane argues, but both used their racial identity and experiences strategically in key circumstances to defend Bush administration policies. This is but one sense in which their race, despite their reluctance to be seen as racial figures, is significant in relation to U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>Locating Powell and Rice within the genealogy of the current national security strategy, and within broader shifts under George W. Bush, this work argues that their racial location in the context of the construction of U.S. foreign policy is symbolic, and that it serves to distract from the substantive part they play in the ongoing reconfiguration of U.S. global power. Criticism of Powell's and Rice's policies, for example, is often blunted by race. Black liberals may be reluctant to condemn them, while white liberals may be afraid criticism could be interpreted as racial bias, especially since conservatives of both races argue that such criticism is probably racist. Lusane tackles these difficult issues along with others, asking whether there is a black consensus on foreign policy and, if so, what its dimensions, driving forces, and prospects for stability are. How can a progressive alternative to the current U.S. foreign policy be realized? Are Powell and Rice merely functionaries, or did they substantially determine the direction of U.S. foreign policy? What will their legacies be?</p>"
"Interpreting the Renaissance: princes, cities, architects","['Tafuri, Manfredo.']","<p>Manfredo Tafuri (1935–1994) is acknowledged as one of Italy’s most influential architectural historians. In his final work, <i>Interpreting the Renaissance</i>, published here in English for the first time (the Italian edition, <i>Ricerca del Rinascimento</i>, appeared in 1992), Tafuri analyzes Renaissance architecture from a variety of perspectives, exploring questions that occupied him for over thirty years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
What theoretical terms were&nbsp;used to describe&nbsp;the humanist analogy between architecture and language?&nbsp;Is it possible to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;the political motivations behind the period’s new urban strategies? And how does humanism embody both an attachment to tradition and an urge to experiment?<br>
Tafuri&nbsp;studies the&nbsp;theory&nbsp;and practice of Renaissance&nbsp;architecture,&nbsp;offering new and compelling readings of&nbsp;its&nbsp;various&nbsp;social, intellectual&nbsp;and cultural contexts, while providing&nbsp;a broad&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;of&nbsp;uses of representation&nbsp;that shaped&nbsp;the entire era.&nbsp;He&nbsp;synthesizes the history of architectural ideas and projects through discussions of the great centers of architectural innovation in Italy (Florence, Rome, and Venice),&nbsp;key patrons from the middle of the fifteenth century (Pope Nicholas V) to the early sixteenth century (Pope Leo X),&nbsp;and crucial figures such as Leon Battista Alberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Lorenzo de’ Medici, Raphael, Baldassare Castiglione, and Giulio Romano.<br>

"Homophobia: Description, Development, And Dynamics Of Gay Bashing (papers In Art History From The)",['Martin Kantor'],"<p>Many gays and simpatico straights view homophobia as a problem for gays and lesbians, but not as a treatable disorder. This book attempts to pathologize most forms of homophobia—to view homophobia as a symptom of an emotional disorder. Homophobia is studied from a developmental perspective, showing how it originates in the homophobe's early relationships. With a scientifically-based eclectic treatment approach, this work uses psychodynamic, interpersonal, existential, cognitive/behavioral, and supportive techniques to treat homophobes and to help gays and lesbians who are the recipients of the manifestations of this emotional disorder.</p>
<p>Though about homophobia, this book is also meant to shed light on other forms of bigotry, from anti-Semitism to xenophobia. It will be of interest to gays and lesbians, sympathetic heterosexuals, therapists, and faculty and students in gay and lesbian studies.</p>"
Poppa Psychology: The Role Of Fathers In Children's Mental Well-being (architecture; 5),['Vicky Phares'],"<p>Many people seem to be searching for answers to help explain their past, understand their current way of being, and create a happier, more satisfying future. It is the current trend to blame mothers for such emotional problems. <i>Poppa Psychology</i> calls into question this habit of blaming mothers, and focuses, instead, on the father-child relationship. Regardless of whether the father is present or absent, his actions will have a direct influence on the child's development.</p>
<p>Fathers have received a great deal of media attention lately, but the main focus has been on their absence. <i>Poppa Psychology</i> deals with the psychological ramifications of the father-child relationship, regardless of whether the fathers are present or absent. Specifically, it highlights factors that are related to maladjustment in children and provides suggestions for raising psychologically healthy children.</p>"
The Media and the Persian Gulf War,"['Denton, Robert E.', 'Jr']","<p>Many scholars call the Persian Gulf conflict the first prime-time war. Certainly, the technologies, strategies, and skills of the military in managing the public agenda were equal to those of the television networks and major print organizations. The Media and the Persian Gulf War focuses on the processes and effects of the media, both leading up to and during the mother of all battles in 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p>Broad in scope and varied in methodologies, the chapters span the media of television, radio, print, and film. Chapters discuss such specific topics as the relationship between the press and the censoring military, CNN's and C-SPAN's coverage, how talk radio and television covered the war, the media's depiction of women in the military, the Gulf War as a referent in advertising, and how popular culture legitimized the war. This work will be an important resource for scholars in political and mass communication, popular culture, and political science.</p>"
What A Time It Was: The Best Of W. C. Heinz On Sports,['W. C. Heinz'],"<p>Many think that W. C. Heinz stands right alongside the legendary <i>New York Times</i> columnist Red Smith as the greatest sports writer of the 1940s and '50s. Paving the way for the New Journalism of Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe, and Jimmy Breslin, Heinz was the first sports writer to make his living exclusively by writing for magazines. Whether describing mobbed-up boxers, crippled jockeys, lame horses, aspiring ballplayers, or driven football coaches, Heinz's finely etched, indelible portraits recall a sports era less influenced by money, image, and self-indulgence. He collaborated with Vince Lombardi on the book <i>Run to Daylight,</i> cowrote the novel <i>M*A*S*H</i> with Dr. H. Richard Hornberger under the pseudonym Richard Hooker, and wrote what Hemingway considered to be the ""only good novel about a fighter I've ever read,"" <i>The Professional.</i> In this collection of Heinz's finest writing, we meet the immortal Red Grange; the injury-riddled, ""purest baseball player"" of his era, Pistol Pete Reiser; the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time, Sugar Ray Robinson; and the Brownsville Bum, Bummy Davis, in a story that Jimmy Breslin calls the ""best magazine sports story of all time."" Here is a long-overdue homage to a vastly underappreciated writer.</p>"
Politics Of Conscience: A Biography Of Margaret Chase Smith,"['Wallace, Patricia Ward , 1938-']","<p>Margaret Chase Smith was the most influential woman in the history of American politics. Her goal was to be a United States senator, not a woman senator, and she succeeded by overcoming gender, not by championing it. Smith began her political career as Maine's daughter and demonstrated nationally the New England virtues of honesty, hard work, frugality, and reticence. She became America's heroine when she courageously confronted Senator Joe McCarthy at the height of his power with her <i>Declaration of Conscience</i> speech. In her statement she championed the American right to criticize, to hold unpopular beliefs, and to practice free speech. Associating herself with the politics of conscience, Smith won three more terms in the Senate and sat on the powerful Armed Services, Appropriations, Space, Government Operations, and Intelligence committees. Altogether, she was in Congress 32 years and by the time her career ended she had established an enduring prototype for female and minority politicians.</p>
<p>This biography of Margaret Chase Smith is the first historical treatment of Smith to use her voluminous private papers as well as extensive interviews with Smith and her colleagues in Congress. As Maine's daughter, Smith was frugal, hard-working, reticent, and caustic. At age thirty-two she married, in scandal, state-politician Clyde Smith with whom she had been involved since she was sixteen and who was twenty-one years her senior. Smith came to Washington when Clyde was elected to Congress and, against his wishes, she became his secretary. When Clyde died in office in 1940, Smith played the widow's game and successfully ran for his seat. In the House during World War II, Smith sat on the powerful Naval Affairs Committee and, tutored by committee counsel Bill Lewis, developed a national constituency, the military, which in turn allowed her to better serve Maine's interests. Lewis directed Smith's first Senate campaign in 1948 when she won an upset victory by an astonishing margin. Overnight she became the darling of the Republican party, the heroine of women everywhere, and the only woman in the United States Senate. Immediately, she became embroiled with Joseph McCarthy and courageously confronted him with her Declaration of Conscience speech four years before a Senate majority censored him. Associating herself with politics of conscience, Smith was elected to three more terms and sat on the powerful Armed services, Appropriations, Space, Government Operations, and Intelligence committees. America's heroine was a political icon by the time she was defeated in 1972 at the age of seventy-four.</p>"

"Men, Machines, And Modern Times","['Morison, Elting Elmore.']","<p>Men, Machines, and Modern Times, though ultimately concerned with a positive alternative to an Orwellian 1984, offers an entertaining series of historical accounts taken from the nineteenth century to highlight a main theme: the nature of technological change, the fission brought about in society by such change, and society's reaction to that change.Beginning with a remarkable illustration of resistance to innovation in the U.S. Navy following an officer's discovery of a more accurate way to fire a gun at sea, Elting Morison goes on to narrate the strange history of the new model steamship, the Wapanoag, in the 1860s. He then continues with the difficulties confronting the introduction of the pasteurization process for milk; he traces the development of the Bessemer process; and finally, he considers the computer. While the discussions are liberally sprinkled with amusing examples and anecdotes, all are related to the more profound and current problem of how to organize and manage system of ideas, energies, and machinery so that it will conform to the human dimension.</p>"

Character Design For Mobile Devices,['Nfgman.'],"<p>Mobile gaming on cell phones and portable consoles is a huge business, and many characters have become design icons. However, the physical limitations of these small screens, and the technological challenges of different gaming platforms, mean that designers have had to become experts at creating characters with just a few points of light. Creating art for these devices is a completely different process than used when creating art for highly sophisticated 3D games. The difference between pixel art and art created for 3D games is two-fold: there are practical considerations that must be addressed as well as aesthetic considerations. This book will cover both subjects as well as examining the evolution of gaming graphics—explaining the significance of the changes we’ve seen in game artistry and what we can learn from examining successful icons and graphics created in the past.

"The Monastery: A Study Of Freedom, Love, And Community",['George A. Hillery'],"<p>Monasteries are one of the few types of communities that have been able to exist without the family. In this intimate, first-hand study of the daily life in a Trappist monastery, Hillery concludes that what binds this unusual and highly successful community together is its emphases on freedom and agape love. <i>The Monastery</i> reintegrates sociology with its allied disciplines in an attempt to understand the monastery on its own terms, and at the same time link that with sociology. Hillery delves into the history, the importance of the Rule of Benedict, the strictness of the Trappist interpretation, and the significance of the Second Vatican Council. Throughout, he uses a holistic anthropological approach.</p>
<p>The work begins with a detailed sociological analysis of freedom, love, and community. Other topics include ways in which candidates enter the monastery, their relation to their families, economic activities, politics, prayer, asceticism, recreation, illness, death, and deviance. Comparisons are made with nine of the other eleven Trappist monasteries in the United States. Anthropologists and sociologists, especially those interested in community, comparative analysis, and religion are challenged by <i>The Monastery</i> to move beyond the arbitrary limits they have placed on themselves, which maintain that all knowledge must be capable of being physically perceived and statistically measured.</p>"

In so doing, Kosovo also brought into sharp focus the military, political, and moral dilemmas confronting a liberal democracy intent on wielding preeminent power on a global scale.</p><p>What are the moral implications posed by waging high-tech warfare for humanitarian purposes? Does the precedent set by intervention of this type point toward peace and stability or toward more war? How well suited are the United States military and American society as a whole to the security challenges of the age of globalization?</p><p>According to Bacevich and Cohen, gauging the success achieved in Kosovo yields important answers to these and related questions. The volume includes a well-crafted historical overview of the war and six essays that place it in a broader context. The contributors explore the conflict's relationship to U.S. grand strategy, the Revolution in Military Affairs, and American civil-military relations, among other topics.</p><p>Contributors: William A.

Illumination And Night Glare: The Unfinished Autobiography Of Carson Mccullers (wisconsin Studies In Autobiography),['Carson Mccullers'],"<p>More than thirty years after it was written, the autobiography of Carson McCullers, <i>Illumination and Night Glare</i>, will be published for the first time. McCullers, one of the most gifted writers of her generation—the author of <i>Member of the Wedding, Reflections in a Golden Eye,</i> and <i>The Ballad of Sad Cafe</i>—died of a stroke at the age of fifty before finishing this, her last manuscript. Editor Carlos L. Dews has faithfully brought her story back to life, complete with never-before-published letters between McCullers and her husband Reeves, and an outline of her most famous novel, <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i>.</p>
<p>Looking back over her life from a precocious childhood in Georgia to her painful decline from a series of crippling strokes, McCullers offers poignant and unabashed remembrances of her early writing success, her family attachments, a troubled marriage to a failed writer, and friendships with literary and film luminaries (Gypsy Rose Lee, Richard Wright, Isak Dinesen, John Huston, Marilyn Monroe), and the intense relationships of the important women in her life.</p>"
Neural Network Learning And Expert Systems (bradford Books),['Stephen I. Gallant'],"<p>Most neural network programs for personal computers simply control a set of fixed,canned network-layer algorithms with pulldown menus. This new tutorial offers hands-on neural network experiments with a different approach. A simple matrix language lets users create their own neural networks and combine networks, and this is the only currently available software permitting combined simulation of neural networks together with other dynamic systems such as robots or physiological models. The enclosed student version of DESIRE/NEUNET differs from the full system only in the size of its data area and includes a screen editor, compiler, color graphics, help screens, and ready-to-run examples. Users can also add their own help screens and interactive menus.The book provides an introduction to neural networks and simulation, a tutorial on the software, and many complete programs including several backpropagation schemes, creeping random search, competitive learning with and without adaptive-resonance function and ""conscience,""counterpropagation, nonlinear Grossberg-type neurons, Hopfield-type and bidirectional associative memories, predictors, function learning, biological clocks, system identification, and more.In addition, the book introduces a simple, integrated environment for programming, displays, and report preparation. Even differential equations are entered in ordinary mathematical notation. Users need not learn C or LISP to program nonlinear neuron models. To permit truly interactive experiments, the extra-fast compilation is unnoticeable, and simulations execute faster than PC FORTRAN.The nearly 90illustrations include block diagrams, computer programs, and simulation-output graphs.Granino A. Kom has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Arizona and has worked in the aerospace industry for a decade. He is the author of ten other engineering texts and handbooks.</p>"
"Parenting Experts: Their Advice, The Research, And Getting It Right",['Jane Rankin'],"<p>Most parents lack the time, training, and other resources needed to consult the extensive research on parenting that has been produced by scientific study. Instead, many rely on advice from a few well-known authorities cited in popular books, newspaper columns, and other media. Dr. Rankin takes a critical look at the advice of five of these experts— Benjamin Spock, T. Berry Brazelton, James Dobson, Penelope Leach and John Rosemond—then compares it with the findings of hundreds of empirical studies on children and parents. The focus is on major parenting problems, including persistent infant crying, toilet training, early day care, discipline, adolescent sexuality education, substance abuse, and the influence of television and other electronic media. A final chapter summarizes the accuracy of each expert's advice compared with research findings, points out the common ground between experts, and summarizes their major strategies and biases.</p>
<p>In some cases, a substantial gap exists between expert advice and scientific research findings. Parents, as well as medical, educational, and social service professionals and students will find this book not only helpful, but illuminating. Rankin's meticulous analysis points out areas of agreement and dispute between some of the most quoted parenting experts in the field, and, perhaps even more revealing, areas where their widely quoted pronouncements deviate from research and clinical evidence.</p>"
"Depression: Self-consciousness, Pretending, And Guilt","['Keen, Ernest , 1937-']","<p>Most studies of depression focus on the psychiatric or medical interpretation of the experience. Sadness and guilt are human experiences, Keen argues, not disease symptoms. They involve the intricate layers of enacting a style for others, of coping with moral crises, and enduring disappointment. Depression tells us of life and death, good and evil, but not sickness and health.</p>
<p>Keen begins with human consciousness, in contrast to the non-reflective consciousness of animals. It becomes clear that the social meanings of being depressed complicate and may even obscure the experiences of sadness and guilt that must be lived through and survived in human depression. The uniquely human and moral content is highlighted; the dysfunction of disease is demystified. Of particular interest to practitioners, professors, and students involved with psychology.</p>"

Disfigured Images: The Historical Assault On Afro-american Women (contributions In Afro-american And African Studies: Contempo),['Patricia Morton'],"<p>Much of the material unearthed by this book is ugly, states historiographer Patricia Morton who exposes profoundly dehumanizing constructions of reality embedded in American scholarship as it has attempted to render the history of the Afro-American woman. Focusing on the scholarly literature of fact rather than on fictional or popular portrayals, Disfigured Images explores the telling--and frequent mis-telling--of the story of black women during a century of American historiography beginning in the late nineteenth century and extending to the present. Morton finds that during this period, a large body of scholarly literature was generated that presented little fact and much fiction about black women's history. The book's ten chapters take long and lingering looks at the black woman's prefabricated past. Contemporary revisionist studies with their goals of discovering and articulating the real nature of the slave woman's experience and role are thoroughly examined in the conclusion. Disfigured Images complements current work by recognizing in its findings a long-needed refutation of a caricatured, mythical version of black women's history.</p>
<p>Morton's introduction presents an overview of her subject emphasizing the mythical, ingrained nature of the black woman's image in historiography as a natural and permanent slave. The succeeding chapters use historical and social science works as primary sources to explore such issues as the foundations of sexism-racism, the writing of W.E.B. DuBois, twentieth century notions of black women, current black and women's studies, new and old images of motherhood, and more. The conclusion investigates how and why recent American historiographical scholarship has banished the old myths by presenting a more accurate history of black women. This keenly perceptive and original study should find an influential place in both women's studies and black studies programs as well as in American history, American literature, and sociology departments. With its unusually complete panorama of the period covered it would be a unique and valuable addition to courses such as slavery, the American South, women in (North) American history, Afro-American history, race and sex in American literature and discourse, and the sociology of race.</p>"
Naked Wine: Letting Grapes Do What Comes Naturally,['Alice Feiring'],"<p>Naked wine is wine stripped down to its basics—wine as it was meant to be: wholesome, exciting, provocative, living, sensual, and pure. Naked, or natural, wine is the opposite of most New World wines today; Alice Feiring calls them “overripe, over-manipulated, and overblown” and makes her case that good (and possibly great) wine can still be made, if only winemakers would listen more to nature and less to marketers, and stop using additives and chemicals. But letting wine make itself is harder than it seems.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Feiring answered a dare to try her hand at natural winemaking. In <b><i>Naked Wine</i></b>,she details her adventure—sometimes calm, sometimes wild, always revealing—and peers into the nooks and crannies of today’s exciting, new (but centuries-old) world of natural wine.</p>"
Joyce Catholic Comedy Lang,['Beryl Schlossman'],"<p>Neither simple apostate nor obedient Christian, James Joyce developed a uniquely ambivalent attitude toward his Irish Catholic roots—one that became inscribed in his imagination and served as a constant aesthetic focus and symbolic source in his fiction. In this study, Beryl Schlossman traces the theological and liturgical echoes that resonate in Joyce’s work, particularly in <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, and argues that the writer’s special brand of Catholicism necessitates a double reading of the fiction. Confronting the Catholic Word with Celtic wit, she suggests, Joyce’s world is an interrelated blend of the sacred and the comic, the deeply religious and the obscene, the defiant, the blasphemous. Students, scholars, and readers of Joyce, modern or comparative literature, contemporary criticism, and theology will find this a comprehensive and convincing study that illuminates the themes, poetic language, and central paradox of Joyce’s art.</p>"
Military Necessity: Civil-military Relations In The Confederacy (in War And In Peace: U.s. Civil-military Relations),['Paul D. Escott'],"<p>Never before or since in American history have the needs and influence of the military weighed so heavily on society. Escott analyzes the militarization of life in the Confederacy and probes the relationships between military commanders, legislators, and Jefferson Davis and his administration. As the South struggled to wage an exhausting war against the North, military necessity increasingly determined policy and shaped all aspects of life. The military had an increasingly large impact not only on policy but also on events inside civil society. Military men played important roles in bringing about extensive social change, enforcing law and order, and placing significant restrictions on individual freedoms.</p>
<p>Ultimately the crisis of the Confederacy threatened both the constitutionalism that southern politicians long had cherished and a core principle of the tradition of civil control over the military. Key figures in the army also took the lead in urging the use of slaves as soldiers and promoting the idea of emancipation. With many portraits of high-ranking generals and civil officials and telling anecdotes that reveal the nature of their relationships, this book reveals the depth of the Confederacy's social, political, and military crisis and highlights what this crisis revealed about the foundations of Confederate society.</p>"
Landmark Of The Spirit: The Eldridge Street Synagogue,['Annie Polland'],"<p>New York City’s magnificent Eldridge Street Synagogue was built in 1887 in response to the great wave of Jewish immigrants who fled persecution in eastern Europe. Finding their way to the Lower East Side, the new arrivals formed a vibrant Jewish community that flourished from the 1850s until the 1940s. Their synagogue served not only as a place of worship but also as a singularly important center in the development of American Judaism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A near ruin in the 1980s that was recently reopened after a massive twenty-year restoration, the Eldridge Street Synagogue has been named a National Historic Landmark. But as Bill Moyers tells us in his foreword, the synagogue is also “a landmark of the spirit, . . . the spirit of a new nation committed to the old idea of liberty.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annie Polland uses elements of the building’s architecture—the façade, the benches, the grooves worn into the sanctuary floor—as points of departure to discuss themes, people, and trends at various moments in the synagogue’s history, particularly during its heyday from 1887 until the 1930s. Exploring the synagogue’s rich archives, the author shines new light on the religious life of immigrant Jews, introduces various rabbis, cantors and congregants, and analyzes the significance of this special building in the context of the larger American-Jewish experience.</p>

Alexander: The Conqueror,['Laura Foreman'],"<p>No individual has made his mark on the world more profoundly than Alexander the Great, the young man who, through war, diplomacy, and Machiavellian means, expanded his empire to include most of the known world--all before he died at age thirty-three. A remarkable man whose path crossed with some of the most influential people, places, and events of all time, Alexander began his combat training at age seven, studied philosophy with Aristotle at age thirteen, kept a copy of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> under his pillow until his death, and introduced Greek and oriental cultural influences throughout his vast empire.<i>Alexander: The Conqueror</i> follows the progression of his conquests through the Near East and Central Asia to the Indus Valley, and introduces Alexander's family, the personalities of his generals, and the cultures of the lands he conquered. Author Laura Foreman examines the complex character of Alexander as student, friend, lover, military genius, and emperor, and explores the many unsolved mysteries surrounding his life: Who did Alexander turn to in passion and for comfort? Was Alexander a careful, amiable mastermind or a drunken brute? Could Alexander have been responsible for his father's murder?Gorgeous landscape photography, numerous images of ancient art and artifacts, and informative, beautifully crafted maps complement the narrative, offering a visual feast along with a lively, insightful narrative of Alexander's life of conquest and intrigue.</p>"
Clinton's World: Remaking American Foreign Policy,['William G. Hyland'],"<p>No modern U.S. president inherited a stronger, safer international position than Bill Clinton. In 1992, the Cold War was over, and the nation was at peace and focused on domestic issues. Despite this temporary tranquility, Clinton would soon be faced with a barrage of crises, including flare-ups of unrest in the Middle East, ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia, uneasy relations with Japan and China, persistent trouble in the Persian Gulf, the dissolution of the USSR, and disastrous situations in Somalia and Haiti.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive and balanced examination of Clinton's foreign policy—the first such book to cover all the global focal points of his administration to date—William G. Hyland brilliantly shows the effects of combining this confusion with Clinton's unique personality characteristics. His first term was marked, in the author's analysis, by murky policy, unrealistic goals, and the mishandling of several crises. By the end of that term he learned some hard lessons, was able to alter his pattern of response, and reversed himself on some major aspects of foreign policy—all to benefit, in the author's view, the country and the world as a whole.</p>"

Federal Income Tax,['John F. Witte'],"<p>No program of the federal government has elicited so many calls for reform—and none has resisted reform efforts so consistently—as the income tax. In this book, John Witte provides the most detailed, clearly stated, accurate, and up-to-date exposition of the history of the federal income tax, while offering an acute analysis of the political factors that have shaped it over more than a century. This work is essential source material for all policy makers and policy analysts, and a lucid and comprehensive survey for students in public policy, public administration, budget and tax policy, political economy, and contemporary political theory. In short, Witte explains in graphic detail why the income tax remains in virtual chaos, and just what the prospects are of future reform.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witte’s analysis is based in the context of incremental/pluralist policy-making theory. He begins by outlining and analyzing incremental theory and income tax policy, and then surveys past and present theories in income taxation. The broad center of the book consists of a detailed legislative and political history of the development of the income tax from the Civil War through the Reagan policies of the 1980s. Witte then offers an analysis of the growth, distribution, and politics of approximately one hundred tax expenditure provisions, and he concludes with an appraisal of recorded public opinions on income tax issues between 1948 and 1979.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witte’s book, original in concept and boldly stated, will be essential reading not only for tax scholars, students, and professionals, but for all who are concerned with the form of American democracy and the political life of the nation.</p>"

Why Literature Matters In The 21st Century,['Mark William Roche'],"<p>Not just another jeremiad against prevailing isms and orthodoxies, <i>Why Literature Matters in the 21st Century</i> examines literature in its connection to virtue and moral excellence. The author is concerned with literature as the teacher of virtue. The current crisis in the humanities, Mark William Roche argues, may be traced back to the separation of art and morality. (“When the distinction between is and ought is leveled,” he writes, “the power of the professions increases.”)<br>
The arts and humanities concern themselves with the fate and prospects of humankind. Today that fate and those prospects are under the increasing influence of technology. In a technological age, literature gains in importance precisely to the extent that our sense of intrinsic value is lost. In its elevation of play and inexhaustible meaning, literature offers a counterbalance to reason and efficiency. It helps us grasp the ways in which diverse parts form a comprehensive and complex whole, and it connects us with other ages and cultures. Not least, great literature grapples with the ethical challenges of the day.<br>

Adenauer's Germany And The Nazi Past,['Norbert Frei'],"<p>Of all the aspects of recovery in postwar Germany perhaps none was as critical or as complicated as the matter of dealing with Nazi criminals, and, more broadly, with the Nazi past. While on the international stage German officials spoke with contrition of their nation's burden of guilt, at home questions of responsibility and retribution were not so clear. In this masterful examination of Germany under Adenauer, Norbert Frei shows that, beginning in 1949, the West German government dramatically reversed the denazification policies of the immediate postwar period and initiated a new ""Vergangenheitspolitik,"" or ""policy for the past,"" which has had enormous consequences reaching into the present.</p>
<p>Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past chronicles how amnesty laws for Nazi officials were passed unanimously and civil servants who had been dismissed in 1945 were reinstated liberally -- and how a massive popular outcry led to the release of war criminals who had been condemned by the Allies. These measures and movements represented more than just the rehabilitation of particular individuals. Frei argues that the amnesty process delegitimized the previous political expurgation administered by the Allies and, on a deeper level, served to satisfy the collective psychic needs of a society longing for a clean break with the unparalleled political and moral catastrophe it had undergone in the 1940s. Thus the era of Adenauer devolved into a scandal-ridden period of reintegration at any cost. Frei's work brilliantly and chillingly explores how the collective will of the German people, expressed through mass allegiance to new consensus-oriented democratic parties, cast off responsibility for the horrors of the war and Holocaust, effectively silencing engagement with the enormities of the Nazi past.</p>

Miracle At Kitty Hawk: The Letters Of Wilbur And Orville Wright,"['Wilbur Wright', 'Orville Wright']","<p>On December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Wilbur (1867–1912) and Orville (1871–1948) Wright made the first controlled, sustained flights in a power-driven airplane.

With little formal education and the slight business background of selling and repairing bicycles, they overcame the problems that defeated the great scientific minds of the day, dealt with large corporations and governments on their own terms, and were recognized by their contemporaries as geniuses. Whether confronting adverse weather conditions, ensuring secrecy, trying to convince the U.S. government that they had actually flown, fighting patent infringements, or responding to public acclaim, these letters reveal the resourcefulness, good humor, and pluck of America's most famous brothers.</p>"

The Strange Case Of Hellish Nell: The True Story Of Helen Duncan And The Witch Trial Of World War Ii,['Nina Shandler'],"<p>On March 23, 1944, as the Allied Forces were preparing for D-Day, Helen Duncan—""Nell"" to her six children and four grandchildren and ""Hellish Nell"" to her detractors—stood in the dock of Britain's highest criminal court accused of:witchcraft! At the time of her arrest, Helen Duncan was Britain's most controversial psychic, a celebrity medium with a notorious reputation. During her seances, she channeled spirits who spoke from the world beyond, and on a few occasions, her ""spirit"" seemed to know too much: Helen's seances were accurately revealing top-secret British ship movements. Intelligence authorities wanted ""Hellish Nell"" silenced. Using diaries, personal papers, interviews, and declassified documents, Nina Shandler resurrects this strange episode and explores the unanswered questions surrounding the trial: Did ""Hellish Nell"" channel spirits of the dead who gave away wartime secrets? Was she a calculating charlatan or the innocent target of obsessive wartime secrecy? Why did the Director of Public Prosecutions try her as a witch, and not a spy? Sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, <i>The Strange Case of Hellish Nell</i> is a true crime tale laced with psychic phenomena and wartime intrigue.</p>"
"The First Day Of The Blitz: September 7, 1940","['Stansky, Peter , 1932-']","<p>On September 7, 1940, the long-feared and anticipated attack by the German Luftwaffe plunged London into a cauldron of fire and devastation. This compelling book recreates that day in all its horror, using rich archival sources and first-hand accounts, many never before published. Eminent historian Peter Stansky weaves together the stories of people who recorded their experiences of the opening hours of the Blitz. Then, exploring more deeply, the author examines what that critical day meant to the nation at the time, and what it came to mean in following years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the future of Britain was determined in the first twelve hours of bombing, Stansky contends. The Blitz set in motion a range of responses that contributed to ultimate victory over Germany and to a transformation of British society. The wave of terror, though designed to quash morale, instead inspired stoicism, courage, and a new camaraderie. The tragic London bombing can reveal much of relevance to our own violent times, Stansky concludes: both the effectiveness of modern terror and its ultimate failure are made powerfully clear by the events of September 7, 1940.</p>

The resulting mosaic argues that most problems associated with illicit drugs are caused by laws restricting them. This book is a realistic appraisal of legalization, vital to anyone concerned about illicit drugs, public policy, and democracy.</p>
<p>Despite the ineffectiveness and counterproductivity of anti-drug laws, enthusiasm grows for them. Laws that fail to eliminate drugs may nonetheless achieve hidden goals. Miller illuminates those goals and asks whether they are wise. Although drug war proponents may complain that civil liberties interfere with drug suppression, Miller argues that the answer is not less democracy, but more. He presents a message of hope and healing, based upon a century of scientific research and historical experience, and declares that legalization would not be a surrender to drugs, but liberation from them.</p>"

<br>
 The book is divided into two parts. Part one explores the historical background, including such tools as double exposure, in-camera mattes, miniature photography, Schufftan-technique, front and rear screen projection, Introvision, color difference mattes, motion control and other building blocks that have brought visual effects to its current status. Part two features a series of in-depth interviews with noted artists covering feature film, television, and commercial projects. The reader will learn how these technicians developed their tools and talents, including education, experimentation and development of their craft. The chapters will explore their approaches to various challenges in the projects they've worked on. Subjects such as blue/green screen, motion control, number encoding, plate photography, as well as miniature and creature design and implementation are only some of the areas that are covered. The artists also discuss how they work with the director of photography, how they document the set, production work, preparation for post production, as well as design and development of various composite elements. In addition to the techniques employed on various projects, the artists discuss specific shots that succeed and others they wish they could do over, and how they would undertake them the second time.</p>

Persistent Poverty: The American Dream Turned Nightmare,['R. H. Ropers'],"<p>Once heralded as 'the land of opportunity,' America has become, for increasing numbers of her inhabitants, a nation of disappointment and hardship. In a land characterized by innumerable economic, environmental and social problems, poverty is escalating to the point where approximately one-third of the population is composed of the poor and the near poor. Persistent Poverty provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of one of Americaâs most disturbing social problems.In a clear, uncompromising style, Richard H. Ropers, Ph.D., a noted authority on the plight of the poverty-stricken, unravels a skein of government inconsistencies in handling the mounting effects of poverty, homelessness, the welfare system, and the gradual polarization of our class system, resulting in the gradual erosion of the middle class. After examining various 'blame-the-victim' and 'blame the system' theories of inequality, Dr. Ropers asserts that such poverty results primarily from long-term economic, social, and political policies and is not necessarily derived from the supposed deviant behavior of the poor.With a staggering 70 million Americans living just above or below the poverty line, the author advises that urgent attention be paid to the structural roots of poverty in light of significant increases in the rate of crime, juvenile delinquency, substance abuse, domestic violence, and unemployment. As an objective focus on the enormous scope of poverty, this groundbreaking work offers keen insights into the argument that despite substantial efforts to alleviate similar plights worldwide, the United States cannot provide sufficient care for her own impoverished citizens.Sociologists, educators, politicians, urbanologists, public officials, and concerned citizens will all benefit from this provocative and thoughtful appraisal.</p>"
The Land That Never Was: Sir Gregor Macgregor And The Most Audacious Fraud In History,['David Sinclair'],"<p>Once upon a time, in the heart of Central America, there was a country named Poyais. It was exceptionally rich in resources, civilization, and culture and was ruled by the brave and enlightened Scottish soldier, Sir Gregor MacGregor, who became its ruler after his heroic exploits in the fight for South American independence. On a cold January morning in 1823, a group of Scottish immigrants looking for a new life set sail for this tropical Eden called Poyais.The only catch was that it didn't exist.A month later the ship landed on the swamp-infested Mosquito Coast and the settlers realized that they had become the victims of one of the most elaborate hoaxes in history. The land they had been sold was nonexistent, the banknotes and guidebooks they carried with them were forgeries, their documents were worthless. Poyais was a fiction. The man responsible? Sir Gregor MacGregor. Who was this eccentric, scurrilous man? And why is he such a lovable rogue?</p>"
Technology And The New Economy,"['Chong-en Bai', 'Chi-wa Yuen']","<p>One of the most important forces driving economic performance in the United States and other countries during the 1990s was the rise of information technology. The new technology has had such a significant impact on the economy that ""the new economy"" emerged as a popular term in both the media and academia.This book, written in an accessible style, examines basic questions about the effects of information technology on various aspects of the economy. The topics include the relationship between innovation and the stock market value of the innovating firm; competition policy; demand factors as determinants of growth; institutional aspects of the innovation process;and the effectiveness of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy.</p>"
Life Is With Others: Selected Writings On Child Psychiatry,['Donald J. Cohen'],"<p>One of the most influential child psychiatrists of the twentieth century, Donald J. Cohen (1940-2001) made groundbreaking contributions to the study of autism and developmental disabilities, Tourette’s syndrome, developmental psychopathology, child psychoanalysis, and children’s adaptation to trauma. As director of the Yale Child Study Center from 1983 to 2001, he fostered international collaborations and innovative approaches to the study of children’s mental health. This book contains a selection of some of his most enduring and influential writings.<br>
Showcasing Dr. Cohen’s distinctive approach, these essays—one of which is published here for the first time—address a wide range of topics including autobiographical writings; childhood psychiatric disorders; the role of play fantasy, aggression, and violence in childhood; and research ethics and mentorship.</p>"
The Human Face of Japan's Leadership: Twelve Portraits,['Martin E. Weinstein'],"<p>One of the most prevalent and dangerous American misperceptions is the image of Japan as a faceless, impersonal, corporate entity. In The Human Face of Japan's Leadership, Weinstein gives a human face to the leaders who will lead that nation into the next century. In doing so, he gives the reader a better idea of what makes these men tick, of the experiences which have shaped their values, and their views of Japan and the world. Weinstein conducted approximately 100 hours of taped interviews with 12 internationalized Japanese leaders in their 40s and 50s, including four members of the Diet, four bureaucrats, and four businessmen. These interviews form the core of the book: 12 biographical portraits, presented as oral histories and largely in the participant's words. These are individual, personal accounts which begin with family and regional background and include childhood and youth in World War II and the Occupation: educational experiences and views of Japan's future. These accounts also shed light on how the system of educational meritocracy and family interact to produce Japanese leaders. Japan's leadership includes a relatively high proportion of people, who while insiders and members of their Establishment, are at the same time knowledgeable and at ease in foreign languages and cultures. These internationalized leaders are committed to successful interaction with the outside world. Weinstein's book will help Americans gain a more accurate, balanced view of their most important overseas trading partner and ally in the Pacific. It could easily serve as a supplementary text in many courses on Japan, ranging from history and politics to business and management.</p>                        <p>Interviews with 12 contemporary Japanese leaders.</p>"
Zhuangzi : Basic Writings,"['Zhuangzi', 'Burton Watson']","<p>Only by understanding Dao (the Way of Nature) and dwelling in its unity can humankind achieve true happiness and freedom, in both life and death. This is the central tenet of the philosophy that was to become Daoism, espoused by the person -- or group of people -- known as Zhuanzi (369?-286? B.C.), in the text of the same name. In order to be free, individuals must discard rigid conventions that distinguish good from bad, right from wrong, and follow a course of action not founded on motives of gain or striving. When one ceases to judge events as good or bad, man-made suffering disappears and natural suffering is embraced as part of life.</p><p>Elucidating a mystical philosophy dedicated to the spiritual nourishment of the individual, Zhuangzi makes many points through humor. He also uses parable and anecdote, non sequitur and even nonsense, to jolt the reader into awareness of truth outside the pale of ordinary logic. With inspired, unconventional language and visionary ideas, the <i>Zhuangzi</i> seems to float free of the historical period and society in which it was written, addressing all people across all ages.</p><p>Columbia presents this renowned translation by Burton Watson of a seminal text in Chinese philosophy in pinyin romanization for the first time.

Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Culture,"['Russell Ferguson', 'Cornel West', 'Martha Gever', 'Trinh T. Minh-Ha']","<p>Out There addresses the theme of cultural marginalization - the process whereby various groups are excluded from access to and participation in the dominant culture. It engages fundamental issues raised by attempts to define such concepts as mainstream, minority, and other,and opens up new ways of thinking about culture and representation. All of the texts deal with questions of representation in the broadest sense, encompassing not just the visual but also the social and psychological aspects of cultural identity.Included are important theoretical writings by Homi Bhabha, Helene Cixous, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Monique Wittig. Their work is juxtaposed with essays on more overtly personal themes, often autobiographical, by Gloria Anzaldua,Bell Hooks, and Richard Rodriguez, among others.This rich anthology brings together voices from many different marginalized groups - groups that are often isolated from each other as well as from the dominant culture. It joins issues of gender, race, sexual preference, and class in one forum but without imposing a false unity on the diverse cultures represented. Each piece in the book subtly changes the way every other piece is read.While several essays focus on specific issues in art, such as John Yau's piece on Wilfredo Lam in the Museum of Modern Art, or James Clifford's on collecting art, others draw from debates in literature, film, and critical theory to provide a much broader context than is usually found in work aimed at an art audience. Topics range from the functions of language to the role of public art in the city, from gay pornography to the meanings of black hair styles.Out There also includes essays by Rosalyn Deutsche, Richard Dyer, Kobena Mercer, Edward Said,Gayatri Spivak, Gerald Vizenor and Simon Watney, as well as by the editors.Copublished with the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York Distributed by The MIT Press.</p>"
The Successful Family Business: A Proactive Plan For Managing The Family And The Business,['Edward D. Hess'],"<p>Over 80% of the businesses in the United States are family-owned and managed. From the corner deli or barbershop to global empires in brewing, media, and cleaning products, family businesses embody the entrepreneurial spirit that drives innovation and economic growth and that represents the hopes and dreams of millions for independence, self-sufficiency, and wealth. And yet the track record for entrepreneurial businesses is poor: over three-quarters will fail during the first five years and only 10% will survive a decade. Family business statistics show that fewer than one-third pass succesfully to a second generation, often the result of insufficient planning. Drawing from numerous in-depth examples (both positive and negative), Edward Hess offers a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of family business management and specific strategies to promote the health of the enteprise. A comprehensive guide, <i>The Successful Family Business</i> covers the spectrum of topics from creating a family values statement and code of conduct to resolving conflicts among siblings to managing transitions in leadership and the potential sale of the business. Other issues include: defining perks and benefits (for family and non-family members), working with the board of directors, and going public. Hess concludes with a series of operating rules that apply to every family business and a listing of practical references and resources.</p>"
Runaway American Dream: Listening To Bruce Springsteen,['Jimmy Guterman'],"<p>Over the course of a career now in its fourth decade, Bruce Springsteen has earned one of the most passionate, devoted followings in all rock ’n’ roll. He’s selling more records and concert tickets in his fifties than he sold in his twenties. Yet to many fans he remains an enigma. How has Springsteen produced such a consistent body of work and retained his currency while other top rock ’n’ rollers have gone by the wayside? Jimmy Guterman, an accessible and entertaining music writer, has been writing about Springsteen since the late 1970s. In <i>Runaway American Dream</i>, he delves deep into dramatic and crucial moments from every phase of Springsteen’s career, interpreting the songs and incisively commenting on the man and the culture at large to deliver a nuanced portrait of The Boss from the earliest days right up to Springsteen’s 2005 album, <i>Devils &amp; Dust</i>.</p>"
Evolution: What The Fossils Say And Why It Matters,['Donald R. Prothero'],"<p>Over the past twenty years, paleontologists have made tremendous fossil discoveries, including fossils that mark the growth of whales, manatees, and seals from land mammals and the origins of elephants, horses, and rhinos. Today there exists an amazing diversity of fossil humans, suggesting we walked upright long before we acquired large brains, and new evidence from molecules that enable scientists to decipher the tree of life as never before.</p>
<p>The fossil record is now one of the strongest lines of evidence for evolution. In this engaging and richly illustrated book, Donald R. Prothero weaves an entertaining though intellectually rigorous history out of the transitional forms and series that dot the fossil record. Beginning with a brief discussion of the nature of science and the ""monkey business of creationism,"" Prothero tackles subjects ranging from flood geology and rock dating to neo-Darwinism and macroevolution. He covers the ingredients of the primordial soup, the effects of communal living, invertebrate transitions, the development of the backbone, the reign of the dinosaurs, the mammalian explosion, and the leap from chimpanzee to human. Prothero pays particular attention to the recent discovery of ""missing links"" that complete the fossil timeline and details the debate between biologists over the mechanisms driving the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><i>Evolution</i> is an absorbing combination of firsthand observation, scientific discovery, and trenchant analysis. With the teaching of evolution still an issue, there couldn't be a better moment for a book clarifying the nature and value of fossil evidence. Widely recognized as a leading expert in his field, Prothero demonstrates that the transformation of life on this planet is far more awe inspiring than the narrow view of extremists.</p>

Children Of The Raj,['Vyvyen Brendon'],"<p>Over the span of British rule in India, the children of the Raj numbered in the millions; yet their dramatic, often traumatic, stories have never been fully told. Drawing on memoirs, journals, and oral testimonies, <i>Children of the Raj</i> conjures up the brilliant scenes and exotic atmosphere of the Indian Raj through the rich narratives of the children themselves. Here are accounts of journeys across perilous seas and the heartache of long family separations, as children were banished to British boarding schools and grim holiday homes. The children of the Raj, so often ignored while their elders concentrated on the lofty matters of war and empire, here make their voices heard.</p>"
"Crisis, Call, And Leadership In The Abrahamic Traditions","['Ochs, Peter', 'Johnson, William Stacy.', 'Abraham', '(biblical Patriarch)']","<p>Over three years of study and fellowship, sixteen Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars sought to answer one question: “Do our three scriptures unite or divide us?” They offer their answers in this book: sixteen essays on how certain ways of reading scripture may draw us apart and other ways may draw us, together, into the source that each tradition calls peace. Reading scriptural sources in the classical and medieval traditions, the authors examine how each tradition addresses the “other” within its tradition and without, how all three traditions attend to poverty as a societal and spiritual condition, and what it means to read scripture while facing the challenges of modernity. Ochs and Johnson have assembled a unique approach to inter-religious scholarship and a rare look at scriptural study as a pathway to peace.</p>"

"Pastiche: Cultural Memory In Art, Film, Literature",['Ingeborg Hoesterey'],"<p>Pastiche Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature</p>
<p>Ingeborg Hoesterey</p>
<p>Traces the rise of the pastiche in the arts and popular culture.</p>
<p>In the last two decades cultural theorists and artists have redefined a genre of artistic expression that for centuries was regarded as both elusive and notorious: the pastiche, or pasticcio. Today, highly engaging manifestations of the genre minor can be found in architecture, painting, and mixed media installations; in film, literature, and performance modes ranging from the operatic to rock event; and in supposedly trivial discourses such as advertising.</p>
<p>Postmodern pastiche is about cultural memory as a history of seeing and writing. One of the markers that sets aesthetic postmodernism apart from modernism is artistic practice that borrows ostentatiously from the archive of Western culture, which modernism, in its search for the unperformed, tended to dismiss. Contemporary artists are re-examining traditions that modernism eclipsed in its pursuit of the ""Shock of the New"" or—in the case of architects—the functionalism of the International style.</p>

Anthony Wayne: Soldier Of The Early Republic,['Paul David Nelson'],"<p>Paul David Nelson has written an exciting biography of an exciting figure—the military hero of the American Revolution and the Indian Wars in the Northwest Territory—""Mad"" Anthony Wayne. Some of his contemporaries called him rash and impetuous, a braggart and a dandy. ""More active and enterprising than judicious and cautious"" was George Washington's verdict. True, Wayne had a flair for the dramatic and consciously acted the role of swashbuckler, but he proved himself one of the best and most successful military leaders of the early American republic.</p>
<p>Despite his reputation for madness, Wayne, as Nelson points out, was a prudent and careful officer whose military record belies the myth. When he ran out of wars to fight, Wayne turned to the political arena. Nelson shows that the qualities which made Wayne a great military leader served him well in politics. He proved himself articulate and shrewd in statecraft in a critical time for the young republic, the years just after ratification of the Constitution.</p>"

Perceptrons: An Introduction To Computational Geometry,"['Minsky, Marvin , 1927-2016']","<p>Perceptrons - the first systematic study of parallelism in computation - has remained a classical work on threshold automata networks for nearly two decades. It marked a historical turn in artificial intelligence, and it is required reading for anyone who wants to understand the connectionist counterrevolution that is going on today.Artificial-intelligence research, which for a time concentrated on the programming of ton Neumann computers, is swinging back to the idea that intelligence might emerge from the activity of networks of neuronlike entities. Minsky and Papert's book was the first example of a mathematical analysis carried far enough to show the exact limitations of a class of computing machines that could seriously be considered as models of the brain. Now the new developments in mathematical tools, the recent interest of physicists in the theory of disordered matter, the new insights into and psychological models of how the brain works,and the evolution of fast computers that can simulate networks of automata have given Perceptrons new importance.Witnessing the swing of the intellectual pendulum, Minsky and Papert have added a new chapter in which they discuss the current state of parallel computers, review developments since the appearance of the 1972 edition, and identify new research directions related to connectionism. They note a central theoretical challenge facing connectionism: the challenge to reach a deeper understanding of how ""objects"" or ""agents"" with individuality can emerge in a network. Progress in this area would link connectionism with what the authors have called ""society theories of mind.""Marvin L.

"Philadelphia And The China Trade, 1682-1846: Commercial, Cultural, And Attitudinal Effects",['Jonathan Goldstein'],"<p>Philadelphia merchants had strong ties with their Chinese counterparts for almost a century before American Independence and for 164 years before the establishment of diplomatic relations or other official contacts. This book traces the evolution of those ties. The story begins with the establishment of the port of Philadelphia, which soon became America's largest, and ends with the first Sino-American treaty, which restructured the earlier informal relationships and signaled a decline in trade between the Delaware estuary and the China coast.</p>
<p>In its heyday Philadelphia controlled about one-third of the United States trade with China, and the traders' profits provided substantial capital for industry and public institutions. As Hilary Conroy writes in his foreword: ""The author began his research by immersing himself in the then recently opened Stephen Girard Papers. He found, somewhat to his surprise, that they did not seem to forecast the racism which was later to poison American-Chinese relations."" The author concludes that Sino-American relations have never been significantly improved over those manifested in Philadelphia's old China trade.</p>"
Night Studio: A memoir of Philip Guston,['Musa Mayer'],"<p>Philip Guston (1913Â1980) was driven, sustained, and consumed by art. His style ranged from the social realism of his WPA murals through his abstract expressionist canvasses of the 1950s and 1960s (when he counted Pollock, Rothko, de Kooning, and Kline among his friends) to his cartoonlike paintings of Klansmen, disembodied heads, and tangled piles of everyday objects. Critics and public alike savaged Guston for his return to figurative art, but today his late work is recognized for the singular power of its darkly hilarious vision. Musa Mayer augments her firsthand knowledge with extensive interviews with his family, friends, students, and colleagues, as well as Guston's own letters, notes, and autobiographical writings, to re-create a turbulent era in American art. <i>Night Studio</i>, profusely illustrated (including almost a dozen paintings in full color), illuminates not only the life of a great artist, but the experience of growing up in his shadow.</p>"
The Meaning Of Language (the Mit Press),['Robert M.

Written in a straightforward and explanatory way and filled with examples, this text provides a comprehensive introduction to the field, suitable for students with no background in the philosophy of language or formal logic.The eleven chapters in the book's first part take up a variety of matters connected to questions about what language is for - what meaning has to do with people's ideas and intentions, and with social communication. Included are chapters on the innateness controversy, the private language argument,the possibility of animal and machine language, language as rule-governed or conventional behavior,and the speech act theory.In the second part, thirteen chapters concentrate on what language is about; treating sense and reference, extensionality, truth conditions, and the theories of proper names, definite descriptions, indexicals, general terms, and psychological attributions.Many recent books and courses in the philosophy of language treat the issues and approaches covered in the first or second part of this book; however, this is the first time they are presented together (although either part may be read and/or taught independently). The book's style is pedagogic, not polemical.</p>

Ruth Benedict: Stranger in This Land provides an intellectual and cultural history of the first half of the twentieth century through the life of an important and remarkable woman.<br>
 As a Lyricist poet, Ruth Benedict helped define Modernism. As an anthropologist, she wrote the classic Patterns of Culture and at one point was considered the foremost anthropologist in the United States—the first woman ever to attain such status. She was an intellectual and an artist living in a time when women were not encouraged to be either. In this fascinating study, Margaret Caffrey attempts to place Benedict in the cultural matrix of her time and successfully shows the way in which Benedict was a product of and reacted to the era in which she lived.<br>
 Caffrey goes far beyond providing simple biographical material in this well-written interdisciplinary study. Based on exhaustive research, including access for the first time to the papers of Margaret Mead, Benedict's student and friend, Caffrey is able to put Benedict's life clearly in perspective. By identifying the family and educational influences that so sharply influenced Benedict's psychological makeup, the author also closely analyzes the currents of thought that were strong when Victorianism paralleled the Modernism that figured in Benedict's life work. The result is a richly detailed study of a gifted woman.<br>
 This important work will be of interest to students of Modernism, poetry, and women's studies, as well as to anthropologists.</p>"

Shooting The Truth: The Rise Of American Political Documentaries,['James Mcenteer'],"<p>Political documentaries are more popular now than ever— Michael Moore's <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> (2004), the top-grossing documentary film of all time, is one of many such recent films. In this incisive book, James McEnteer parses the politics of nonfiction films of recent decades, which together constitute an alternative history to many official stories offered by the government and its media minions.</p>
<p>Tracing the origins of an oppositional documentary movement to the Vietnam era, McEnteer shows how a strong independent documentary tradition grew from television's failure to sustain a commitment to the public interest. McEnteer evaluates the work of four artists in depth—the intrepid Barbara Kopple; the puckish but deadly Michael Moore; Errol Morris, a connoisseur of human quirkiness; and anti-Bush crusader Robert Greenwald—and that of other courageous filmmakers, including Barbara Trent (<i>The Panama Deception</i> and <i>Cover-Up: Behind the Iran-Contra Affair</i>). McEnteer looks at the pioneering public affairs documentaries of Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly. Their 1950s CBS program, <i>See It Now</i>, won many awards but angered network owners who did not wish to alienate mass TV audiences with controversy. With Murrow's firing, the retreat of television from engaging civic issues in serious ways began in earnest. McEnteer devotes an entire chapter to the many 2004 documentaries made by both sides in that hotly contested presidential election. He concludes with a look at populist antiwar and antiglobalization films of Big Noise and the Guerrilla News Network, whose youthful producers push the boundaries of the documentary form.</p>
<p>As mass media fail—now more than ever—to fulfill their watchdog role over public officials and policies, the importance of documentaries committed to telling the truth increases. Such films bear witness to important events otherwise hidden from our view. Their makers dare to refute the falsehoods passing for conventional wisdom, sometimes risking their lives or reputations to reveal the nature of those lies and the interests behind them. As <i>Shooting the Truth</i> clearly shows, documentaries have become an essential component for making sense of our time. This book enlarges our appreciation of contemporary nonfiction films and invites debate on the many issues it raises.</p>"
Eight Ways To Run The Country: A New And Revealing Look At Left And Right,['Brian Patrick Mitchell'],"<p>Political partisans want you to choose only between Left and Right, Red and Blue, Us and Them. But the reality is that Americans are deeply divided in more ways than one, and the savvy voter, no less than the savvy politician, must make more sense of things. <i>Eight Ways to Run the Country</i> explains what conventional political theory cannot, offering a profoundly illuminating look at our political past and our present differences.</p>
<p><i>Eight Ways</i> doesn't do away with Left and Right, but it defines them in better terms and adds a whole new dimension to explain what Left and Right can't. It correctly pegs the ideological poles and thus brings easy-to-understand order to the dizzying diversity of political perspectives. It places neoconservatives into historical context, illuminating both what they share with other conservatives and how their differences have wrought a change in the character of the Right. It explains the recurring attempts to define an independent, non-ideological center. It provides the best definition of populism to be found. Finally, it relates the political heritage of the American Founders to the politics of today.</p>"

Experiencing Architecture,['Steen Eiler Rasmussen'],"<p>Profusely illustrated with fine instances of architectural experimentation through the centuries, Experiencing Architecture manages to convey the intellectual excitement of superb design. From teacups, riding boots, golf balls, and underwater sculpture to the villas of Palladio and the fish-feeding pavilion of the Peking Winter Palace, the author ranges over the less-familiar byways of designing excellence.At one time, writes Rasmussen, ""the entire community tool part in forming the dwellings and implements they used. The individual was in fruitful contact with these things; the anonymous houses were built with a natural feeling for place, materials and use and the result was a remarkably suitable comeliness. Today, in our highly civilized society, the houses which ordinary people are doomed to live in and gaze upon are on the whole without quality. We cannot, however, go back to the old method of personally supervised handicrafts. We must strive to advance by arousing interest in and understanding of the work the architect does. The basis of competent professionalism is a sympathetic and knowledgeable group of amateurs, of non-professional art lovers.""</p>"
The Tariff Question In The Gilded Age: The Great Debate Of 1888,"['Reitano, Joanne R.']","<p>Protective tariffs were part of American life long before the era of NAFTA and GATT. In the late nineteenth century, the ""tariff question"" was one of the most controversial issues of the day. As Joanne Reitano shows in this far-reaching study, the ensuing debate was anything but an empty exercise in political rhetoric occupying only politicians and lobbyists. The tariff was of central concern to a broad cross section of people because of its perceived relationship to immediate economic problems, such as wages, prices, and trusts. In fact, it became a means for many Americans to wrestle with the implications of the country's rapid growth and the impact of industrial capitalism on American life.</p>
<p>Reitano focuses on the election year of 1888, when the tariff was adopted as a cause célèbre by President Grover Cleveland, Congress, the two major parties, and the press. At the heart of the debate was the Mills Bill for tariff reduction. Although the bill failed to pass, Reitano finds in the rancorous public debate a barometer of changes in the American mind in the Gilded Age. She carefully blends intellectual, political, economic, and social issues through analyses of the Congressional Record, press coverage of the debate, academic and polemical literature, political cartoons, and the presidential campaign. Ultimately, Reitano contends that ideas about political economy have always been central to the American mind. They were so in the Gilded Age as they are today.</p>"

Actual malice: twenty-five years after Times v. Sullivan,"['Hopkins, W. Wat.']","<p>Published to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, which changed the face of libel law, this book is the first in-depth examination of the actual malice rule constitutionalized in that decision. The author offers a detailed evaluation of the current status of the rule and produces significant new information about the history and working of libel law. He argues that, contrary to much of the scholarly criticism and opinions expressed in the popular press, the actual malice rule is working and should be retained as an integral feature of libel law. Finally, he proposes some changes which would help libel law work more smoothly and effectively. A significant addition to the body of work on libel law, this book will be an invaluable resource for students of law and journalism as well as to practicing attorneys and journalists.</p>
<p>Hopkins begins with an examination of the history of the actual malice rule and the definition Justice Brennan attached to the rule. He explores how the modern definition of actual malice relates to definitions accepted before 1964 and analyzes how the appellate courts have defined and applied the rule since the 1964 decision. Subsequent chapters compare Times Rule Actual Malice with common law actual malice and offer a penetrating discussion of how well the actual malice rule is working in modern libel law. Hopkins concludes that Times Rule Actual Malice is working effectively to balance the interest in robust public debate with the interest in protecting reputation.</p>"
"An Empire Of Ice: Scott, Shackleton, And The Heroic Age Of Antarctic Science",['Edward J. Larson'],"<p>Published to coincide with the centenary of the first expeditions to reach the South Pole, <i>An Empire of Ice</i> presents a fascinating new take on Antarctic exploration. Retold with added information, it's the first book to place the famed voyages of Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, his British rivals Robert Scott and Ernest Shackleton, and others in a larger scientific, social, and geopolitical context.</p>
<p>Efficient, well prepared, and focused solely on the goal of getting to his destination and back, Amundsen has earned his place in history as the first to reach the South Pole. Scott, meanwhile, has been reduced in the public mind to a dashing incompetent who stands for little more than relentless perseverance in the face of inevitable defeat. <i>An Empire of Ice</i> offers a new perspective on the Antarctic expeditions of the early twentieth century by looking at the British efforts for what they actually were: massive scientific enterprises in which reaching the South Pole was but a spectacular sideshow. By focusing on the larger purpose, Edward Larson deepens our appreciation of the explorers' achievements, shares little-known stories, and shows what the Heroic Age of Antarctic discovery was really about.</p>"
"Foul Demons, Come Out!: The Rhetoric Of Twentieth-century American Faith Healing","['Pullum, Stephen Jackson , 1957-']","<p>Pullum examines the rhetorical genre of 20th-century American faith healing. He first analyzes respectively the rhetoric of Aimee Semple McPherson, William Branham, Oral Roberts, Asa Alonzo Allen, Ernest Angley, Kathryn Kuhlman, and Benny Hinn—the most prominent American faith healers of this century. For each, he discusses their background, the nature of the audiences to whom they preached, and why they were so successful. Pullum concludes by drawing together the major rhetorical features of faith-healing discourse.</p>
<p>Pullum shows that faith-healing discourse follows the strategy of offering hope to the hopeless, giving God the glory, articulating humble beginnings, offering testimony of past personal afflictions overcome, and drawing on scripture to bolster their claims. This discourse is often presented in dynamic fashion, making it not only credible, but entertaining as well. After elucidating the rhetorical patterns of faith healers, Pullum evaluates claims of the miraculous in light of the standard that they set for themselves. In other words, miracles as presented by faith healers are juxtaposed to the types one reads about in the Bible. Pullum also attempts to account for why people claim miraculous cures in spite of the fact that nothing miraculous has occurred in the services of faith healers.</p>"
Mass hate: the global rise of genocide and terror,"['Kressel, Neil Jeffrey.']","<p>Rarely does a book emerge that is a wake-up call to the world. <i>Mass Hate</i> is such a masterpiece. It explores why the brutality of humankind has erupted and flowed more expansively in the twentieth century than ever before. More importantly, this monumental work offers specific recommendations on how to stem this bloody global tide of slaughter, terror, and genocide—so that the twenty-first century does not bring more of the same, or worse.Neil Kressel—a respected authority on the psychology of international affairs, genocide, and terrorism—meticulously investigates why in the past eight decades mass hatred has reached genocidal proportions throughout the world. Genocide has occurred so often and blood has gushed so freely that one might consider the urge to kill one’s neighbor an inborn characteristic of our species. Furthermore, the power to wreak bloody havoc on innocent civilians has become not only the sport of ”soldiers,” but of terrorists as well. In light of this, Kressel examines the motives for terrorist acts, specifically those of ultraextremist Muslims. <i>Given the possibility of nuclear devices falling into the hands of terrorists in the next century, we must now come to grips with the epidemic spread of hatred and violence.</i> Our only hope lies in understanding the human impulse to hate and the forces that transform that impulse into brutish action. In his quest for a thorough understanding of what ignites mass slaughter, Kressel probes beyond the facile, stock answers that traditionally explain such horrors. He plumbs the depths of history, psychology, and political science to derive his own theories of what propels an average citizen to raise the machete to groups of innocent women and children and slash them to death, or to pull the lever to release pernicious gases upon defenseless people, and to do it again and again.The time has come for us all to join Dr. Kressel in investigating the mind of the hater and to learn to identify the circumstances that foment genocide and terrorism. By recognizing their antecedents, Dr. Kressel proposes ways to control, if not defeat, these twin forces of evil. The breathtaking sweep and depth of this trenchant work promises to make it a classic.In his investigation, he focuses on:</p>"

The Older Worker Advantage: Making The Most Of Our Aging Workforce,"['Gordon F. Shea', 'Adolf Haasen']","<p>Recently published figures predict that the number of employed individuals between the ages of 55 and 64 will increase by 11 million by 2010; on average, today's 65-year-old can expect to live to 83. This book tackles the issue of the aging workforce head on, taking into account both the organization's/manager's point of view and the older employee's point of view. Gordon Shea and Adolf Haasen, experts on corporate culture and management development, consider the broad demographic trends that are changing the makeup of organizations, and then provide specific approaches for managers to adopt in order to ensure that older employees are engaged and challenged while contributing to the company's bottom line. The authors consider such topics as: what motivates olders workers, the impact of technology on older worker training, and career trends in the health, education, and retail sectors. They showcase pioneering efforts in multi-generational work at such organizations as AES Corporation and the U.S. Coast Guard, and they offer a variety of checklists and other interactive and diagnostic elements to guide managers. The book concludes with information on the legal apsects of older worker employment, along with resources for both managers and older employees.</p>
<p>As the huge cadre of baby boomers approaches traditional retirement age, such factors as financial security, health benefits, and the attractiveness of staying active in later years are encouraging more older people to work well into their 60s, 70s, and even 80s, while businesses are learning to anticipate their long-term employment needs, and facing potential labor shortages unless they hold onto and develop more older workers. The economic, political, and cultural implications of these trends will reach staggering proportions, changing the make-up of organizations large and small and the very nature of work and our attitudes toward it.</p>"
Deadbeat Dads: A National Child Support Scandal,"['Marcia Mobilia Boumil', 'Joel Friedman']","<p>Recently, many political voices have indicated a strong desire to track down absent fathers who have absconded without fulfilling child support obligations to their biological or adopted children. This renewed interest in deadbeat dads has resulted from a recognition that the social welfare programs, which pick up the tab for abandoned children, are contributing significantly to an ever-increasing federal budget deficit. Meanwhile, in a large number of cases, there simply isn't enough money for an absent parent to maintain his own separate support and fulfill the support obligations that the law requires. This book explores the history, reforms, and consequences of child support in America. The authors have included case studies as well as discussions on the psychological consequences of separating families, effects of divorce laws on the award of child support, contested paternity, and child custody alternatives. They conclude with a discussion on economic responsibility and the deadbeat epidemic. The book is intended to empower the larger number of parents who are caught in the midst of overworked agencies, discouraging tales, and the lack of information that keeps them paralyzed from acting on their own behalf.</p>"
Reggae Bloodlines: In Search Of The Music And Culture Of Jamaica,['Stephen Davis'],"<p>Reggae—vulcanizing, restrained, irresistible—is more than the national music of Jamaica: It is a social force that fills the complete cultural needs of the people it serves. Everyone in Jamaica, from the prime minister in his gardens to the Rastafarian elders in Trench Town, listens to the latest reggae songs for an immediate line on the political and spiritual pulse of the island. <i>Reggae Bloodlines,</i> originally published in 1977 and here updated with a new afterword, was the first book to tell the story of the music of the Jamaican people and their spiritual nationality, the Brotherhood of Rastafari. It includes interviews with reggae’s master musicians—Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Toots Hibbert, Big Youth, Peter Tosh, Agugstus Pablo, Max Romeo—and Prime Minister Michael Manley; reportage on Jamaican politics; and it sorties into the nation’s lush interior in search of the ganja fields of Kali Mountain and the legendary Maroon enclaves, still inhabited by the descendants of slave warriors. <i>Reggae Bloodlines</i> is not an encyclopedia of Jamaican style, nor a critical appraisal of its music—it is a definitive portrait of a struggling nation and its musical heritage at the crucial turning point of decolonization. Packed with hundreds of astonishing photographs, <i>Reggae Bloodlines</i> captures the restless rhythm of reggae culture like no book before or since.</p>"

God's Willing Knowledge: The Influence Of Scotus' Analysis Of Omniscience,['Douglas  C. Langston'],"<p>Rejecting his predecessors' views about omniscience, Duns Scotus radically emphasized the importance of God's willing for His knowing. Many people criticize Scotus's view as inconsistent with his claims about human freedom and minimize the influence of his analysis for subsequent discussions of God's knowledge. Yet Scotus's claims have been extremely influential. His emphasis on God's will and his nonlibertarian view of freedom are found in the writings of the most significant figures discussing divine knowledge: Calvin, Luther, Molina, and Leibniz.</p>
<p><em>God's Willing Knowledge</em> analyzes Scotus's views about God's knowledge and human freedom, as well as the connections between these views and the views of classical proponents of God's omniscience. In addition, it ties these views to the contemporary exchange concerning the free will defense. The conclusion of the book is that, while Scotus's influential views about omniscience and human freedom are not inconsistent, the acceptance or rejection of his claims depend upon an evaluation of their moral implications.</p>"
Richard Strauss: A Musical Life,"['Holden, Raymond.']","<p>Renowned today as the gifted composer of a string of masterworks, Richard Strauss (1864-1949) is less often remembered for his achievement as a major conductor. Yet he held important conducting posts in Munich, Berlin, and Vienna and influenced generations of younger conductors. This important book is the first to consider Strauss's career as a conductor and place it in relation to his life as a composer.</p>
<p>With unique access to extensive materials in the Strauss family's private archives, Raymond Holden corrects misconceptions about Strauss and discusses the musician's understanding of composing and conducting as intertwined processes. Holden throws new light on Strauss's relationships, on his disputed role during the Third Reich, and particularly on his performance practices and principles.</p>"
Friday Night Lights,"['Bissinger, H.

Odessa is not known to be a town big on dreams, but the Panthers help keep the hopes and dreams of this small, dusty town going. Socially and racially divided, its fragile economy follows the treacherous boom-bust path of the oil business. In bad times, the unemployment rate barrels out of control; in good times, its murder rate skyrockets. But every Friday night from September to December, when the Permian High School Panthers play football, this West Texas town becomes a place where dreams can come true. With frankness and compassion, H. G. Bissinger chronicles a season in the life of Odessa and shows how single-minded devotion to the team shapes the community and inspires—and sometimes shatters—the teenagers who wear the Panthers' uniforms.</p>"

Daring Wives: Insight Into Women's Desires For Extramarital Affairs,"['Praver, Frances Cohen , 1968-']","<p>Riveting vignettes show the inner and outer lives of women engaged in extramarital affairs. In spotlighting the many influences that spur women to cheat—from marital discord, childhood histories and sociopolitical history to pop and postmodern culture—Dr. Praver neither condemns nor condones such affairs. Instead, she aims to help wives and husbands question their own desires and actions, recognize their own roles in marital problems, and become inspired to find creative solutions. This work is an intimate and comprehensive examination of wives' desires for extramarital affairs. It includes vignettes from younger and older wives, as well as working, stay-at-home and remarried wives, from those with and without children, and from those who turn to same-sex affairs. The authoritative and scholary underpinnings are presented in a reader-friendly style that will appeal to all women, as well as to clinicians and academics.</p>
<p>Readers who are involved in or considering extramarital affairs will feel supported, validated, and inspired to enter into a dialogue for change. This book and its vivid case studies, filled with dialogue that allows readers a front-row seat in the therapy room, inspire one to listen and learn without harsh perjorative judgments. While the issues here are profound, the book is always evocative and enjoyable.</p>"
"Vichy France: Old Guard And New Order, 1940-1944",['Robert O. Paxton'],"<p>Robert O. Paxton's classic study of the aftermath of France's sudden collapse under Nazi invasion utilizes captured German archives and other contemporary materials to construct a strong and disturbing account of the Vichy period in France. With a new introduction and updated bibliography, <i>Vichy France</i> demonstrates that the collaborationist government of Marshal Pétain did far more than merely react to German pressures. The Vichy leaders actively pursued their own double agenda -- internally, the authoritarian and racist ""national revolution,"" and, externally, an attempt to persuade Hitler to accept this new France as a partner in his new Europe.</p>

"Three Friends: Roy Bedichek, J. Frank Dobie, Walter Prescott Webb",['William A. Owens'],"<p>Roy Bedichek, J. Frank Dobie, and Walter Prescott Webb--a naturalist, a folklorist, and a historian--all taught at the University of Texas, lived only a few blocks apart, and saw each other almost every day. The true cement of their friendship, however, was the correspondence that makes up much of this book. They wrote not to exchange information, but to communicate ideas, to nail down the generalities of conversation, and, above all, to challenge, encourage, and stimulate one another.</p>

Post-soviet Russia: A Journey Through The Yeltsin Era,"['Medvedev, Roy Aleksandrovich , 1925-']","<p>Roy Medvedev, one of the world's best-known Russian scholars and a former consultant to both Gorbachev and Yeltsin analyzes the main events that have transpired in the Russian federation since late August 1991. He looks at the plans that were meant to restructure a society in crisis but -- for reasons both complex and obvious -- were destined to fail. From the drastic liberalization of prices and ""shock therapy"" to the privatization of state owned property and Yeltsin's resignation and replacement by Vladimir Putin, this is an intricately fascinating saga of good intentions, philosophical warfare, and catastrophic miscalculations.</p>
<p>Among the many compelling facts detailed here are Yeltsin's utter surprise -- and lack of preparation -- at the failed coup against Gorbachev in 1991, when power fell virtually into his lap; his failure to heed the warnings of learned advisers like Yuri Yaremenko, who knew that Western economics could not be applied to Russia; and Yeltsin's dramatic (and unprecedented) decree in 1992 allowing anyone to sell or buy anything they wished.</p>
<p>In a sweeping conclusion covering the critical events of 1998 and 1999 as well as a detailed analysis of the 1995 and 1996 elections, Medvedev lays forth an exhaustive survey of recent political shifts, attitudes, statistics, and trends. From birth and death rates on the farm and in the city through a number of highly charged campaigns and elections to the new goal of the Communist Youth League (to become millionaires), this is a breathtakingly detailed survey of an unforgettable chapter in Russia's history.</p>

Fire In The Grove: The Cocoanut Grove Tragedy And Its Aftermath,['John L. Esposito'],"<p>Saturday night, November 28, 1942, Boston suffered its worst disaster ever. At the city's premier nightspot, the Cocoanut Grove, the largest nightclub fire in United States history took the lives of 492 people-nearly one of every two people on the premises. A flash of fire that started in an imitation palm tree rolled through the overcrowded club with breathtaking speed and in a mere eight minutes anyone left in the club was dead or doomed. The Grove was a classic firetrap, the product of greed and indifference on the part of the owners and the politicians who had knowingly allowed such conditions to exist. Against the backdrop of Boston politics, cronyism, and corruption, author John C. Esposito re-creates the drama of the fire and explores the public outcry that followed. In chronicling the horrific events of one of America's most cataclysmic tragedies, Esposito has fashioned both an incomparably gripping narrative and a vibrant portrait of the era. But it is the intense, detailed narrative of the fire-harrowing yet compulsively readable-and the trials that followed that will stay with readers well after they finish this remarkable book.</p>"
Scaramutza In Germany: The Dramatic Works Of Caspar Stieler,['Judith P. Aikin'],"<p>Scaramuzza, Scaramouche: the commedia dell'arte figure made a triumphal entry into German literature in the plays of Caspar Stieler (1632–1707). Transformed into a master of language and languages, Scaramutza—social critic, voluptuary, and mouthpiece for his author—ushers in a new type of comedy that depends more on the happy ending than on laughter for its effect. This study should both establish the significance of the long-neglected dramatic works of Caspar Stieler, already regarded as an important lyric poet of the German Baroque, and serve to initiate a reevaluation of German comedy and of the standard definition of the comic genre used by Germanists as Aikin explores the heroic or romantic comedy as a subgenre of literary merit. The study includes a discussion of Stieler's important contributions to the development of the German-language <em>Singspiel</em> and opera.</p>"

The breaking jewel,"['Oda, Makoto , 1932-']","<p>Set on an island in the South Pacific during the final days of World War II, when the tide has turned against Japan and the war has unmistakably become one of attrition, <i>The Breaking Jewel</i> offers a rare depiction of the Pacific War from the Japanese side and captures the essence of Japan's doomed imperial aims. The novel opens as a small force of Japanese soldiers prepares to defend a tiny and ultimately insignificant island from a full-scale assault by American forces. Its story centers on squad leader Nakamura, who resists the Americans to the end, as he and his comrades grapple with the idea of <i>gyokusai</i>, (translated as ""the breaking jewel"" or the ""pulverization of the gem""), the patriotic act of mass suicide in defense of the homeland.</p>
<p>Well known for his antiestablishment and antiwar sentiments, Makuto Oda gradually and subtly develops a powerful critique of the war and the racialist imperial aims that proved Japan's undoing.</p>

When Congress Debates: A Bakhtinian Paradigm,"['Sheckels, Theodore F.']","<p>Sheckels provides the first book-length study of Congressional debating. The limited work on the topic in the communication discipline has argued that such debating is tedious and inconsequential. Sheckels, however, offers a new paradigm, derived from the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, that counteracts this assumption. This paradigm also counters the often unvoiced assumption that debates are inherently biopolar with the initial premise that they are instead polyphonic. The polyphony, however, goes beyond the recognition of the multiple speakers who participate and the drama they enact, to the awareness of the voices these speakers introduce within their discourse. These voices range from the words of authorities to the narratives of average Americans, from classical prosopopoeia to what Bakhtin terms stylization. Speakers also sometimes enact what Bakhtin terms double-voiced discourse; furthermore, there are moments of what Bakhtin terms carnivalesque energy. Bakhtin's work finally alerts the critic to the illusion of finalizability in Congressional debates.</p>
<p>After outlining this paradigm, Sheckels uses it to examine six Congressional debates, ranging in date from a 1960 Senate filibuster on a civil rights matter to the 1999 House debate on articles of impeachment and includes analyses of such flash points as the Confederate flag, sexual harassment in the military, and partial-birth abortion. These case studies reveal both the utility and the flexibility of the Bakhtinian perspective. Thoughtful analyses that will be of great interest to scholars and researchers involved with rhetoric and political communication.</p>"
Investing In Innovation: Creating A Research And Innovation Policy That Works (the Mit Press),['Lewis M. Branscomb and  James H.

The authors of this volume were invited by the Clinton administration to take a hard,nonpartisan look at how successful the new policies have been and to propose ways to make their programs more effective. The first summary report of the team's recommendations was called the ""hottest technology policy property on Capitol Hill.""This book, an expansion of that report, offers a new set of technology policy principles. The authors use the principles to evaluate many federal research programs and to make recommendations for change. This volume will set the terms of the debate over the national research and innovation policy for years to come.</p>"
International Studies And Academic Enterprise: A Chapter In The Enclosure Of American Learning,['Robert Mccaughey'],"<p>Sicily occupies a crucial position in the Mediterranean world. It is at the heart of many cross-currents of trade, people, and ideology that flowed unceasingly through the ancient period. The island was home to many people, most of them not native to it: Phoenicians, Greeks, and then Romans settled there and sought ways of expressing their hybrid identities. The Sicilians, no less than their invaders, were concerned with their image and their contribution to the age. In this volume ideas of identity, image, and acculturation are the central themes. The contributions combine detailed investigation of the archaeological finds in which the island abounds with an examination of the understudied tradition of history and literature on or about the island. The book provides a chronological account of the island's history, interwoven with a series of discussions of Sicilian identity: to show Sicily as a center of affairs from the Iron Age to the Augustan Empire within the context of a fundamentally regional ancient world. The book includes a chronology and guides for further reading.</p>"

The Lotus Sutra,,"<p>Since its appearance in China in the third century, <i>The Lotus Sutra</i> has been regarded as one of the most illustrious scriptures in the Mahayana Buddhist canon. The object of intense veneration among generations of Buddhists in China, Korea, Japan, and other parts of the world, it has had a profound impact on the great works of Japanese and Chinese literature, attracting more commentary than any other Buddhist scripture.</p>
<p>As Watson notes in the introduction to his remarkable translation, "" <i>The Lotus Sutra</i> is not so much an integral work as a collection of religious texts, an anthology of sermons, stories, and devotional manuals, some speaking with particular force to persons of one type or in one set of circumstances, some to those of another type or in other circumstances. This is no doubt why it has had such broad and lasting appeal over the ages and has permeated so deeply into the cultures that have been exposed to it."" —Victor Mair</p>


                        <p>Since it first appeared in China in the third century, this Mahayana Buddhist Scripture has been regarded as one of the most illustrious in the canon. Depicting events in a cosmic world that transcends ordinary concepts of time and space, The Lotus Sutra presents abstract religious ideas in concrete terms and affirms that there is a single path to enlightenment.

Protecting Liberty In An Age Of Terror (belfer Center Studies In International Security),"['Philip B. Heymann', 'Juliette N. Kayyem']","<p>Since September 11, 2001, much has been said about the difficult balancing act between freedom and security, but few have made specific proposals for how to strike that balance.</p>
<p>As the scandals over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the ""torture memos"" written by legal officials in the Bush administration show, without clear rules in place, things can very easily go very wrong.With this challenge in mind, Philip Heymann and Juliette Kayyem, directors of Harvard's Long-Term Legal Strategy Project for Preserving Security and Democratic Freedoms in the War on Terrorism, take a detailed look at how to handle these competing concerns. Taking into account both the national security viewpoint and the democratic freedoms viewpoint, Heymann and Kayyem consulted experts from across the political spectrum — including Rand Beers, Robert McNamara, and Michael Chertoff (since named Secretary of Homeland Security) — about the thorniest and most profound legal challenges of this new era. Heymann and Kayyem offer specific recommendations for dealing with such questions as whether assassination is ever acceptable, when coercion can be used in interrogation, and when detention is allowable. They emphasize that drawing clear rules to guide government conduct protects the innocent from unreasonable government intrusion and prevents government agents from being made scapegoats later if things go wrong. Their recommendations will be of great interest to legal scholars, legislators, policy professionals, and concerned citizens.</p>"

The Aids Conspiracy: Science Fights Back,['Nicoli Nattrass'],"<p>Since the early days of the AIDS epidemic, many bizarre and dangerous hypotheses have been advanced to explain the origins of the disease. In this compelling book, Nicoli Nattrass explores the social and political factors prolonging the erroneous belief that the American government manufactured the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to be used as a biological weapon, as well as the myth's consequences for behavior, especially within African American and black South African communities.</p>
<p>Contemporary AIDS denialism, the belief that HIV is harmless and that antiretroviral drugs are the true cause of AIDS, is a more insidious AIDS conspiracy theory. Advocates of this position make a ""conspiratorial move"" against HIV science by implying its methods cannot be trusted and that untested, alternative therapies are safer than antiretrovirals. These claims are genuinely life-threatening, as tragically demonstrated in South Africa when the delay of antiretroviral treatment resulted in nearly 333,000 AIDS deaths and 180,000 HIV infections -- a tragedy of stunning proportions.</p>
<p>Nattrass identifies four symbolically powerful figures ensuring the lifespan of AIDS denialism: the hero scientist (dissident scientists who lend credibility to the movement); the cultropreneur (alternative therapists who exploit the conspiratorial move as a marketing mechanism); the living icon (individuals who claim to be living proof of AIDS denialism's legitimacy); and the praise-singer (journalists who broadcast movement messages to the public). Nattrass also describes how pro-science activists have fought back by deploying empirical evidence and political credibility to resist AIDS conspiracy theories, which is part of the crucial project to defend evidence-based medicine.</p>

Iraq And The War Of Sanctions: Conventional Threats And Weapons Of Mass Destruction,['Anthony H. Cordesman'],"<p>Since the Gulf War, Iraq has attempted to win through confrontation, diplomacy, and bluster what it could not achieve on the battlefield. Defense analyst Anthony Cordesman suggests that this war of sanctions may be a struggle that Iraq has begun to win. Saddam Hussein's regime remains aggressive and ambitious, and its military capabilities cannot be judged solely by the current state of IraQ's armed forces. Most dangerous of all is IraQ's continuing effort to build an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Cordesman analyzes Iraqi strategic intentions and diplomatic opportunities, and assesses the options available to the international community to counter the Iraqi threat.</p>
<p>Iraq has effectively used diplomatic means to divide the United Nations and exploit Arab sympathies, while using its oil wealth as an incentive to win support for an easing of sanctions. The military potential of Iraq, and especially its development of weapons of mass destruction, must be considered as much for its intimidation value as for any actual utility in a possible war. A realistic assessment of IraQ's future capabilities, says Cordesman, must take into account these political and strategic factors as purely military considerations.</p>"
Inventing The Internet (inside Technology),['Janet Abbate'],"<p>Since the late 1960s the Internet has grown from a single experimental network serving a dozen sites in the United States to a network of networks linking millions of computers worldwide. In Inventing the Internet, Janet Abbate recounts the key players and technologies that allowed the Internet to develop; but her main focus is always on the social and cultural factors that influenced the Internets design and use. The story she unfolds is an often twisting tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players, including government and military agencies, computer scientists in academia and industry, graduate students, telecommunications companies, standards organizations, and network users.The story starts with the early networking breakthroughs formulated in Cold War think tanks and realized in the Defense Department's creation of the ARPANET. It ends with the emergence of the Internet and its rapid and seemingly chaotic growth. Abbate looks at how academic and military influences and attitudes shaped both networks; how the usual lines between producer and user of a technology were crossed with interesting and unique results; and how later users invented their own very successful applications, such as electronic mail and the World Wide Web. She concludes that such applications continue the trend of decentralized, user-driven development that has characterized the Internet's entire history and that the key to the Internet's success has been a commitment to flexibility and diversity, both in technical design and in organizational culture.</p>"
God And Production In A Guatemalan Town (texas Pan American Series),['Sheldon Annis'],"<p>Since the late 1970s, Protestantism has emerged as a major force in the political and economic life of rural Guatemala. Indeed, as Sheldon Annis argues in this book, Protestantism may have helped tip Guatemala's guerrilla war in behalf of the army during the early 1980s.</p>
<p>But what is it about Protestantism--and about Indians-- that has led to massive religious conversion throughout the highlands? And in villages today, what are the dynamics that underlie the competition between Protestants and Catholics?</p>
<p>Sheldon Annis addresses these questions from the perspective of San Antonio Aguas Calieutes, an Indian village in the highlands of midwestern Guatemala. Annis skillfully blends economic and cultural analysis to show <em>why</em> Protestantism has taken root. The key ""character"" in his drama is the village Indian's tiny plot of corn and beans, the <em>milpa</em>, which Annis analyzes as an ""idea"" as well as an agronomic productive system. By exploring ""<em>milpa</em> logic,"" Annis shows how the economic, environmental, and social shifts of the twentieth century have acted to undercut ""the colonial creation of Indianness"" and, in doing so, have laid the basis for new cultural identities.</p>"
Rewriting The United States Constitution: An Examination Of Proposals From Reconstruction To The Present,['John R. Vile'],"<p>Since the Reconstruction period, there have been over forty proposals to rewrite the U.S. Constitution. John Vile's unique historical study analyzes all of these proposals within the framework of the constitutional amending process. In each case Vile examines the substance of the proposal, its goals and methods, the response to the proposal, and its overall influence--concluding that the Constitution in its current form faces no immediate threats. He finds no convincing cases for a new Constitution and believes that most perceived defects can be remedied with less drastic measures. The study illuminates issues of constitutional change, stressing the importance of understanding alternative forms of government and the basis for their support. While immediate change is not likely, constitutional change will ultimately come, and when it does, earlier criticisms and suggestions may help to set the agenda. Proposals for change are critiques which help to identify strengths and weaknesses in the current system. In addition, examinations of past proposals reveal how people view the Constitution during crises. This work will be particularly useful for political scientists, historians, lawyers, and individuals interested in, or involved with, efforts for constitutional change.</p>"
Aids Education: Reaching Diverse Populations (culture; 55),"['Martin Forst', 'Melinda Moore']","<p>Since the time AIDS and HIV infection were first discovered, no medical cures have been developed. It became clear early on that education would be the cornerstone in the fight against AIDS, and that assessment remains true in the 1990s. This book describes how to tailor HIV education and prevention efforts to specific communities, including how to identify those most at risk, what types of interventions are most appropriate to those communities, how to engage those most at risk, and the role of participatory evaluation in determining the effectiveness of community education efforts.</p>

Making Peace: A First-hand Account Of The Arab-israeli Peace Process,['Eytan Bentsur'],"<p>Sitting around one oval table for the first time at the Madrid Conference in 1991, historic Arab and Israeli enemies pledge to work toward regional peace and security. From Madrid onward, Middle East diplomacy has been pursued on two tracks—between Israel and its immediate neighbors, and among all the countries of the region. This book reveals, for the first time, an insider's account of the true significance of the Madrid Conference and how a revolution in Middle Eastern affairs was wrought there.</p>
<p><i>Making Peace</i> details the debates, doubts, reversals, and accomplishments that crystallized at the Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991. In the months leading up to this historic event, Eytan Bentsur, today Director-General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, worked closely with his counterparts from other countries to find a formula that might bridge the bitter and seemingly intractable rivalry between Israelis and Arabs. This formula was to become known as the famous two-track approach and is an important source of the incredible progress made toward regional peace and security in recent times. Arguing persuasively that the Middle East peace revolution was triggered by the Madrid gathering, Bentsur sheds new light on the leading personalities and ideas that made the conference a success and a foundation for future progress.</p>
<p>An Israeli official who belonged to an avowed peace group within a hesitant government, Bentsur devised new formulas that made the advantages of peace more palpable to a national leadership and public that were sometimes obsessed with the problems of the peace process. The book elucidates the origins, rationale, and impact of the two-track approach. It is a gripping, behind-the-scenes account of diplomatic efforts in the cause of peace in a war-torn part of the globe.</p>"
A Chant To Soothe Wild Elephants: A Memoir,['Jaed Coffin'],"<p>Six years ago at the age of twenty-one, Jaed Muncharoen Coffin, a half-Thai American man, left New England's privileged Middlebury College to be ordained as a Buddhist monk in his mother's native village of Panomsarakram—thus fulfilling a familial obligation. While addressing the notions of displacement, ethnic identity, and cultural belonging, <i>A Chant to Soothe Wild Elephants</i> chronicles his time at the temple that rain season—receiving alms in the streets in saffron robes; bathing in the canals; learning to meditate in a mountaintop hut; and falling in love with Lek, a beautiful Thai woman who comes to represent the life he can have if he stays. Part armchair travel, part coming-of-age story, this debut work transcends the memoir genre and ushers in a brave new voice in American nonfiction.</p>"
Vixi: Memoirs Of A Non-belonger,['Richard Pipes'],"<p>Sixteen-year-old Richard Pipes escaped from Nazi-occupied Warsaw with his family in October 1939.

In this engrossing book, the eminent historian remembers the events of his own remarkable life as well as the unfolding of some of the twentieth century’s most extraordinary political events.<br>
From his youthful memories of bombs falling on Warsaw to his recollections of the conflicts inside the Reagan administration over American policies toward the USSR, Pipes offers penetrating observations as well as fascinating portraits of such cultural and political figures as Isaiah Berlin, Ronald Reagan, and Alexander Haig. Perhaps most interesting of all, Pipes depicts his evolution as a historian and his understanding of how history is witnessed and how it is recorded.</p>"

"&quot;It''s Time for My Story&quot;: Soap Opera Sources, Structure, and Response",['Carol Traynor Williams'],"<p>Soap opera story, the only mass-public form of continuing narrative today, is oral culture for our electronic era. Carol Williams' It's Time for My Story is an examination of soap opera sources, structure, and response, particularly from the critical viewpoints of psychology, both archetypal and empirical, and popular culture, specifically narratology and feminism, that uncover the true nature of the genre.</p><p>First, Williams traces the development of soap opera from its immediate source in radio and television as well as from its fundamental source in age-old myth and storytelling. Then she analyzes the content and form that together make up the structure of soap opera. Finally, she looks at what soaps mean to watchers and in the process debunks many myths about soap opera (for instance, the myth that soap opera, like all television drama, is merely commercial, produced formulaically by advertisers; Williams argues that soap opera is not only a commercial product but also a popular art form derived from the wellspring of culture and folk story). She also argues that it is a form which has been depreciated because it is historically a woman's medium. Discussions with writers, creators, and fans are included throughout. Recommended to scholars and students of media, drama, popular culture, and women's studies.</p>"
"Young People, Ethics, And The New Digital Media: A Synthesis From The Goodplay Project (the John D. And Catherine T. Macarthur Foundation Reports On Digital Media And Learning)",['Carrie James'],"<p>Social networking, blogging, vlogging, gaming, instant messaging, downloading music and other content, uploading and sharing their own creative work: these activities made possible by the new digital media are rich with opportunities and risks for young people. This report, part of the GoodPlay Project, undertaken by researchers at Harvard Graduate School of Education's Project Zero, investigates the ethical fault lines of such digital pursuits. The authors argue that five key issues are at stake in the new media: identity, privacy, ownership and authorship, credibility, and participation. Drawing on evidence from informant interviews, emerging scholarship on new media, and theoretical insights from psychology, sociology, political science, and cultural studies, the report explores the ways in which youth may be redefining these concepts as they engage with new digital media. The authors propose a model of ""good play"" that involves the unique affordances of the new digital media; related technical and new media literacies; cognitive and moral development and values; online and offline peer culture; and ethical supports, including the absence or presence of adult mentors and relevant educational curricula. This proposed model for ethical play sets the stage for the next part of the GoodPlay project, an empirical study that will invite young people to share their stories of engagement with the new digital media.The John D. and Catherine T.

The Responsible Judge: Readings In Judicial Ethics,"['John T. Noonan', 'Jr.', 'and  Kenneth I. Winston']","<p>Society and individual members thereof who approach the court in conscience desire justice. They place their hope not only in the knowledge but also in the morality of the judges. At a time when the values of the judiciary are under intense scrutiny, Noonan and Winston present an extensive, highly informed collection of readings with commentary and explication. They address the concept and role of judge, the act of judging, and the requirements and potential abuses inherent in the system and process of sitting in judgment. This is a reflective, yet eminently realistic consideration of the fundamental issues and questions involved in establishing a reasonable framework for assessing judicial morality.</p>
<p>The work first examines qualities of the ideal, corrupt, and over-zealous or political judge. The editors next address the judge's role and response in view of the tensions rising not only from the facts of the case and legal precedents but also from such human qualities as compassion. They also look at the power of social expectations and personal beliefs as possible influences on judicial decisions. Finally, the editors consider the need judges have for independence and study that necessary factor in relationships to accountability and also potential for abuse. This is a learned, inclusive, yet accessible and captivating, work. It will clarify and reinvigorate discussion of critically important issues fundamental to an ethical judiciary.</p>"

Spoken Word Recognition,"['Uli H. Frauenfelder', 'Lorraine Komisarievsky Tyler']","<p>Spoken Word Recognition covers the entire range of processes involved in recognizing spoken words - both in and out of context. It brings together a number of essays dealing with important theoretical questions raised by the study of spoken word recognition - among them, how do we understand fluent speech as efficiently and effortlessly as we do? What are the mental processes and representations involved when we recognize spoken words? How do these differ from those involved in reading written words? What information is stored in our mental lexicon and how is it structured? What do linguistic and computational theories tell us about these psychological processes and representations? The multidisciplinary presentation of work by phoneticians, linguists,psychologists, and computer scientists reflects the growing interest in spoken word recognition from a number of different perspectives. It is a natural consequence of the mediating role that lexical representations and processes play in language understanding, linking sound with meaning.Following the editors' introduction, the contributions and their authors are: Acoustic-Phonetic Representation in Word Recognition (David B. Pisoni and Paul A. Luce). Phonological Parsing and Lexical Retrieval (Kenneth W. Church). Parallel Processing in Spoken Word Recognition (William D. Marslen-Wilson). A Reader's View of Listening (Dianne C. Bradley and Kenneth I. Forster). Prosodic Structure and Spoken Word Recognition (Francois Grosjean and James Paul Gee). Structure in Auditory Word Recognition (Lyn Frazier). The Mental Representation of the Meaning of Words (P. N. Johnson-Laird). Context Effects in Lexical Processing (Michael K.

Hamlet On The Holodeck: The Future Of Narrative In Cyberspace,['Janet H. Murray'],"<p>Stories define how we think, play, and understand our lives. In this comprehensive and readable book — already a classic statement of the aesthetics of digital media, acclaimed by practitioners and theorists alike — Janet Murray shows how the computer is reshaping the stories we live by.Murray discusses the unique properties and pleasures of digital environments and connects them with the traditional satisfactions of narrative. She analyzes the dramatic satisfaction of participatory stories and considers what would be necessary to move interactive fiction from the formats of childish games and confusing labyrinths into a mature and compelling art form. Through a blend of imagination and techno-wizardry, Murray provides both readers and writers with a guide to the storytelling of the future.(cloth published by Free Press, 1997)</p>"

The Six O'clock Presidency: A Theory Of Presidential Press Relations In The Age Of Television,['Fredric T. Smoller'],"<p>Studying the increasingly powerful role television plays in the political process, Fredric T. Smoller offers a persuasive argument that the big three network coverage of the presidency is gradually eroding public support for and confidence in that office. This book argues that network coverage of the presidency is determined by the political, technical, and commercial nature of the medium itself, producing a bias toward extensive and negative coverage. Smoller studies the thematic nature of television's presidential coverage, demonstrating how producers and correspondents integrate their daily coverage into ongoing themes which provide dramatic unity over a prolonged period of time. Thus, television's portrayal of the White House generally starts out favorable but soon becomes unfavorable. Attempts by the White House to combat these negative portrayals by managing news coverage and isolating the president will subvert democratic values.</p>
<p><i>The Six O'Clock Presidency</i> argues against generally accepted views that network coverage of the presidency is too favorable and reveals the power of the networks to unravel the career of individual presidents and the public's support for that office. Noting that television news is getting tougher on the presidency as each full-term administration president since Richard Nixon has received a bigger measure of poor coverage than its predecessor, the author spent several weeks with the White House press corps to determine how this could be explained. He interviewed television news executives, correspondents and technicians for ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as White House officials. The result is a comprehensive study of the economics, technology, and personnel of network news and its coverage of the presidency.</p>"
"Playback: From The Victrola To Mp3, 100 Years Of Music, Machines, And Money","['Coleman, Mark , 1957-']","<p>Suddenly, popular music resembles an alien landscape. The great common ground of 45s, LPs, and even compact discs is rapidly falling by the wayside to be replaced by binary bits of sound. In the 21st century, radical advances in music technology threaten to overshadow the music itself. Indeed, today the generations divide over how they listen to the music, not what kinds of music they enjoy.Playback is the first book to place the staggering history of sound reproduction within its larger social and cultural context. Concisely told via a narrative arc that begins with Edison's cylinder and ends with digital music, this is a history that we have all directly experienced in one way or another. From the Victrola to the 78 to the 45 to the 33 1/3 to the 8track to the cassette to the compact disc to MP3 and beyond (not to mention everyone from Thomas Edison to Enrico Caruso to Dick Clark to Grandmaster Flash to Napster CEO Shawn Fanning), the story of Playback is also the story of music, and the music business, in the 20th century.</p>"

Shakespeare's Friends,['Kate Emery Pogue'],"<p>Taking seriously the commonplace that a man is known by the company he keeps—and particularly by the company he keeps over his lifetime—one can learn more about just about anyone by learning more about his friends. By applying this notion to Shakespeare, this book offers insight into the life of the most famous playwright in history, and one of the most elusive figures in literature. The book consists of sketches of Shakespeare's contact and relationships with the people known to have been close friends or acquaintances, revealing aspects of the poet's life by emphasizing ways in which his life was intertwined with theirs. Though it is difficult to get to know this most famous of playwrights, through this work readers can gain insight into aspects of his life and personality that may otherwise have been hidden.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, more than any other writer in the western world, based much of his work on the consequences of friendship. Given the value placed on friends in his writing, many readers have wondered about the role friendship played in his own life. This work gives readers the chance to learn more about Shakespeare's friends, who they were and what they can tell us about Shakespeare and his times. For instance, Richard Field was a boyhood friend with whom Shakespeare went to school in Stratford. Field became a well-known London printer. The details of Field's life illuminate both the details of Shakespeare's boyhood education and the poet's relationship with the printing, publishing, and book-selling world in London. Francis Collins, a lawyer who represented Shakespeare in a number of legal dealings, drafted both versions of Shakespeare's will. This life-long friend was one of the last men eve to see Shakespeare pick up a pen to write. Through these vivid and animated sketches, readers will come to know about Shakespeare's life and times.</p>
<p>While the book has a lively, accessible narrative tone within chapters, its organization and features make it highly useful to the school library market as well as the academic world. It contains cross references, a detailed Table of Contents and a highly organized structure with uniformity across sections and chapters. The writing is accessible and could be easily used by upper-level high school students looking to augment school assignments.</p>"
American Technological Sublime,"['Nye', 'David E.']","<p>Technology has long played a central role in the formation of Americans' sense of selfhood. From the first canal systems through the moon landing, Americans have, for better or worse, derived unity from the common feeling of awe inspired by large-scale applications of technological prowess. American Technological Sublime continues the exploration of the social construction of technology that David Nye began in his award-winning book Electrifying America. Here Nye examines the continuing appeal of the ""technological sublime"" (a term coined by Perry Miller) as a key to the nation's history, using as examples the natural sites, architectural forms, and technological achievements that ordinary people have valued intensely.American Technological Sublime is a study of the politics of perception in industrial society. Arranged chronologically, it suggests that the sublime itself has a history - that sublime experiences are emotional configurations that emerge from new social and technological conditions, and that each new configuration to some extent undermines and displaces the older versions. After giving a short history of the sublime as an aesthetic category, Nye describes the reemergence and democratization of the concept in the early nineteenth century as an expression of the American sense of specialness.What has filled the American public with wonder, awe, even terror? David Nye selects the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, the Erie Canal, the first transcontinental railroad, Eads Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, the major international expositions, the Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909, the Empire State Building, and Boulder Dam. He then looks at the atom bomb tests and the Apollo mission as examples of the increasing ambivalence of the technological sublime in the postwar world. The festivities surrounding the rededication of the Statue of Liberty in 1986 become a touchstone reflecting the transformation of the American experience of the sublime over two centuries. Nye concludes with a vision of the modern-day""consumer sublime"" as manifested in the fantasy world of Las Vegas.</p>"
Empowering Technology,['Lewis M. Branscomb'],"<p>Technology policy - whether we should have one and what form such a policy should take - was a core issue of the 1992 presidential campaign, and in February 1993 the Clinton administration confirmed that fostering new technologies will be a critical part of its agenda for redirecting the American economy. To help orient the inevitable debates on this agenda, experts from Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs here examine a set of key issues and problems that, taken together, define the scope and limits of such a policy.Among the topics discussed are the new relationship between federal and state governments implied by the administration's proposals, the usefulness of the concept of critical technologies for setting priorities, the creation of new missions for the national laboratories (particularly the three weapons laboratories), the changing nature of the social contract between the government and research universities, the problems that will confront the creation of a national information infrastructure, the best ways to promote small-and medium-sized driver companies as well as civilian research and development generally, and the relationship between education and the requirements for work in the twenty-first century.Lewis M. Branscomb is Albert Pratt Public Service Professor and Director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at the Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University.</p>"
"Prominent Sisters. Mary Lamb, Dorothy Wordsworth, And Sarah Disraeli","['Polowetzky', 'Michael']","<p>Tells the fascinating story of three talented and energetic 19th-century women: Mary Lamb, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Sarah Disraeli. Although little-remembered today, they were widely acknowledged in their own time as important and influential figures in British intellectual and artistic society. One of the earliest proponents of feminism, Mary Lamb was the sister of the eminent essayist, Charles Lamb. She was a friend and correspondent of Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, and Sir Walter Scott, and presided over the most famous literary salon of her day. Dorothy Wordsworth was not only the sister of the great poet but his lifelong intellectual companion. A noted diarist and critic, Dorothy Wordsworth was one of the founders of modern sociology and a major influence on her brother's poetry. While not as public a figure as Mary Lamb and Dorothy Wordsworth, Sarah Disraeli was her brother's trusted and intimate political adviser. Much of what is known about the great prime minister's innermost thoughts is revealed in their 30-year correspondence.</p>"
Cool Energy: Renewable Solutions To Environmental Problems,['Michael Brower'],"<p>Ten years ago, America's brief love affair with renewable energy sources came to an abrupt end, the victim of declining oil prices and government indifference. But renewable energy remains the only viable long-term alternative to depletable and polluting oil, gas, and coal. Cool Energy provides the first major review of progress in the field of renewable energy technologies -solar, wind, biomass (plant matter), hydroelectric, and geothermal - since the mid-1980s. It analyzes their near-term and long-term potential to displace fossil fuels, and illuminates the role they could play in mitigating environmental problems such as air pollution, acid rain, and global warming.Energy-policy specialist Michael Brower argues that, with the right policies, renewable energy could provide as much as half of America's energy needs within forty years. He identifies the market barriers that will have to be removed and argues that if the hidden costs of fossil fuels are taken into consideration, renewables appear to be a cheaper source of new energy supply than fossil fuels: the reliability and efficiency of their equipment have improved and the cost of installing,maintaining, and running renewable systems has declined.Brower devotes a chapter to each renewable energy source, describes its current application, and discusses its costs. He also analyzes new technologies under development and assesses their positive and negative attributes. Introductory chapters set renewables in the context of current energy and environmental policy, and the last chapter outlines steps that can help speed the transition to a renewable-energy economy.Michael Brower is a physicist and holds the position of Research Director for the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>"

New International Economic Order: North-south Debate (mit Bicentennial Studies),"['Bhagwati, Jagdish N.']","<p>The ""north-south debate"" between and within the developed and developing countries on achieving international distributive economic justice has emerged as one of the focal issues of world security and peace. The world economic order is changing, like it or not. Most discussions on the subject are distressingly uninformative, either giving blanket superficial endorsements to the demands of less developed countries or, equally superficially, condemning them out of hand. By contrast, this collection of more than a dozen articles, growing out of a workshop held at MIT in May 1975, is a real attempt to come to grips with the issues. Taken as a whole, the volume provides detailed and systematic reviews of the past history of the issues, their current status, future prospects, and economic desirability. Specific proposals are analyzed in depth, and with rigor and imagination, but without falling back on jargon or complicated mathematics.</p>
<p>Professor Bhagwati sets the stage with an overview of the underlying political and economic factors. In the rest of the book developmental problems are covered under four headings. Section one, on resource transfers, offers essays on economic aid, income distribution, debt relief, and taxing the ""brain drain."" Richard Cooper discusses oceans as a source of revenue. Section two, on international trade, includes Professor Bhagwati's essay on market disruption, and C. Fred Bergsten's proposals on access to supply. Others treat trade policies and commodities. Section three, on world food problems, deals with the stability of grain in D. Gale Johnson's paper and food aid in Alexander H. Sarris's and Lance Taylor's article. Section four, on technology transfer, evaluates multinationals and direct foreign investment. The concluding essay is an extensive panel discussion on the new international economic order as a whole and numbers among the participants Harry G. Johnson, Charles Kindleberger, I. M. D. Little, and Ali Mazrui.</p>
<p>Where there are six economists, a wag once remarked, there are apt to be seven opinions. The present book, part of the MIT Bicentennial Studies series, seeks to fashion out of typically divergent and contentious opinions viable alternatives for reforming the world economic order.</p>"
Lost For Words: The Hidden History Of The Oxford English Dictionary,['Lynda Mugglestone'],"<p>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary (</i><i>OED)</i> holds a cherished position in English literary culture. The story behind the creation of what is indisputably the greatest dictionary in the language has become a popular fascination. This book looks at the history of the great first edition of 1928, and at the men (and occasionally women) who distilled words and usages from centuries of English writing and ""through an act of intellectual alchemy captured the spirit of a civilization.”<br>
The task of the dictionary was to bear full and impartial witness to the language it recorded. But behind the immaculate typography of the finished text, the proofs tell a very different story. This vast archive, unexamined until now, reveals the arguments and controversies over meanings, definitions, and pronunciation, and which words and senses were acceptable—and which were not.<br>
<i>Lost for Words</i> examines the hidden history by which the great dictionary came into being, tracing—through letters and archives—the personal battles involved in charting a constantly changing language. Then as now, lexicographers reveal themselves vulnerable to the prejudices of their own linguistic preferences and to the influence of contemporary social history.</p>"

The Sword Of St. Michael: The 82nd Airborne Division In World War Ii,['Guy Lofaro'],"<p>The 82nd Airborne Division spent more time in combat than any other American airborne unit of World War II, and its fierce battlefield tenacity earned it the reputation of one of the finest divisions in the world. Yet no comprehensive history of the 82nd during World War II exists today. <i>The Sword of St. Michael</i>corrects this significant gap in the literature, offering a lively narrative and thoroughly researched history of the famous division.</p>

Moses Mendelssohn: Sage Of Modernity (jewish Lives),['Shmuel Feiner'],"<p>The “German Socrates,” Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786) was the most influential Jewish thinker of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A Berlin celebrity and a major figure in the Enlightenment, revered by Immanuel Kant, Mendelssohn suffered the indignities common to Jews of his time while formulating the philosophical foundations of a modern Judaism suited for a new age. His most influential books included the groundbreaking <i>Jerusalem</i> and a translation of the Bible into German that paved the way for generations of Jews to master the language of the larger culture.</p>
<p>Feiner’s book is the first that offers a full, human portrait of this fascinating man—uncommonly modest, acutely aware of his task as an intellectual pioneer, shrewd, traditionally Jewish, yet thoroughly conversant with the world around him—providing a vivid sense of Mendelssohn’s daily life as well as of his philosophical endeavors. Feiner, a leading scholar of Jewish intellectual history, examines Mendelssohn as father and husband, as a friend (Mendelssohn’s long-standing friendship with the German dramatist Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was seen as a model for Jews and non-Jews worldwide), as a tireless advocate for his people, and as an equally indefatigable spokesman for the paramount importance of intellectual independence.</p>"
Political Economy Of Information (studies In Communication And Society),['Vincent Mosco'],"<p>The “information society” is real. Information—as a marketable commodity—is quickly taking up the powerful role once held by heavy industry and manufactured products. How this revolution is affecting society, and how society and government are responding to it, is the subject of this book. Its lessons and conclusions are of critical importance as we enter the last decade of this century.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every dimension of social life, whether in the home or the workplace, is affected by information and the technologies that give it market value. Along with the positive aspects of these broad changes, there are inevitable problems: the growing gap between the “information rich” and “information poor,” the need for widespread access to communication and information technology, the threat to individual privacy, and the potential of the technology to create global instabilities. The editors have enlisted specialists and scholars in business, communications studies, computing and information science, economics, law, library science, political science, and sociology to examine these changes and problems by looking at information specifically as a commodity to be traded, protected, and desired.</p>"

"Oldest Allies, Guarded Friends: The United States And France Since 1940",['Charles G. Cogan'],"<p>The author offers a revisionist-style look at the French-American relationship as seen through a series of case studies dating from the great misunderstanding between the Roosevelt administration and the Free French movement in World War II to the formation of the Euro-Corps in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>American power grew tremendously in the wake of World War II and the Cold War that followed, forming, around a strategic consensus based on the indivisibility of defense against the Soviet Union, an American imperium in Europe. The interests of this imperium differed significantly from those of France, the oldest and one of the most important nations in Europe. Great Britain, France's counterpart in these respects, benefitted from special treatment by, and a special relationship with, the United States. France's efforts to develop a national nuclear force as a demonstration of its strength and independence were continually hampered by the United States until the 1970s. Britain's efforts, on the other hand, were not hampered but aided.</p>
<p>In struggling to regain France's leading position in Europe, the French leadership under Charles de Gaulle sought on the one hand an independent nuclear force, and, on the other, a strengthening of Europe with a Franco-German alliance at its core. Both of these policies provoked friction with the United States; both will now have to be revised, after the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a powerful, reunited Germany. The overall prospect, however, is that of continuing differences between France and the United States, as the antagonisms of the past, which date primarily from the World War II era, will not easily die out. Written by a former senior intelligence officer with a background of extensive French government and academic relationships, this book will be invaluable to all students of contemporary European history and U.S. foreign relations.</p>"

French hospitality: racism and North African immigrants,"['Ben Jelloun, Tahar , 1944-']","<p>The award-winning novelist and author of the international bestseller <i>Racism Explained to My Daughter</i> uses his own experience to illuminate the experience of the Other in his adopted land -- and everywhere. A Moroccan who emigrated to France in 1971, Tahar Ben Jelloun draws upon his own encounters with racism along with his insights as a practicing psychologist and gifted novelist to elucidate the racial divisions that plague contemporary society. In a modern France where openly racist leaders such as National Front spokesman Jean-Marie Le Pen have made significant strides toward broad popular acceptance, Ben Jelloun's book is more topical now than ever. His profound and compelling appeal for tolerance -- in both public discourse and the law -- is a passionate yet reasoned argument that racism simply does not make sense in the multicultural world of today.</p>
<p><i>French Hospitality</i> confronts issues of international resonance: the relationship of a formerly colonized people to their onetime colonizers, the encounter between Islam and the modern Judeo-Christian West, and the status of the non-European minorities in Europe today. Underlying these issues is a heartfelt nostalgia for simple, traditional North African hospitality as practiced since time immemorial by a relatively poor and unsophisticated society. Ben Jelloun supplements this rather noble ideal of generosity and welcoming by borrowing the philosophical concept of hospitality -- the opening of oneself to another -- from the works of Emmanuel Lévinas and Jacques Derrida in order to illustrate the moral conception of a nation's unconditional acceptance of foreigners. Isn't the belief in welcoming strangers a fundamental mark of civilization? In a political climate where increasingly repressive immigration laws are a national trend as well as an international phenomenon, he contends, it is not surprising that racism has gained a foothold. Most hurt by racist polemic and politics, he points out, are children of immigrants -- born in France, their memories are those of the French people, and they deserve to be treated with the full respect afforded to any citizen.</p>
<p>With his elegant and imaginative prose, Ben Jelloun shows us both racism's face and the immigrant's heartbreak; but he also evokes the wind of freedom and the ideal of hospitality, and with this gesture offers a kind of hope in extricating ourselves from racism's recidivist incoherencies.</p>

The Master Trend,['Cheryl Russell'],"<p>The Baby Boom generation is leading the nation into the future. Having elected one of its own to the White House, this generation - the largest and best educated in history - is poised to place its imprint on the 21st century. Cheryl Russell - acclaimed author of 100 Predictions for the Baby Boom and former editor-in-chief of American Demographics - meets the challenge of predicting the daunting future of this most singular of generations. Russell perceptively shows why members of the Baby Boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, have always embraced their independence. This individualism has become the master trend of our time. But the Baby Boom generation is now finding itself in the midst of a midlife crisis as it is pulled in one direction by its sense of individualism and in another by its children. Baby Boomers, known for following the beat of their own drummer, are suddenly awakening to the urgent need to bring society together for the sake of their children's future. The Baby Boom generation prizes individualism so highly that it has become the first generation of what Cheryl Russell calls ""free agents."" Like Curt Flood - baseball's first free agent - the Baby Boomers play by their own rules. Free agents have become both the creators and the eager customers of a new, fast-paced, hotly competitive ""personalized economy"" that seizes on cutting-edge technologies to produce the innovative and custom-designed products and services the world so sorely needs. Will this personalized economy bring prosperity to Americans? Can the free agents of the Baby Boom generation make life better for all of us? Will they learn to work together for the good of society? Most important, what kind of society are the Baby Boomers leaving to their children? In a culture that values individualism above all, what will happen to the unprepared millions who are trapped in the margins of society? In a world where the disparity between rich and poor has grown dramatically what kin</p>

The Big House: Image and Reality of the American Prison (Icons of America Series),['Stephen Cox'],"<p>'The Big House is Americaâs idea of the prison-Â­a huge, tough, ostentatiously oppressive pile of rock, bristling with rules and punishments, overwhelming in size and the intent to intimidate. Stephen Cox tells the story of the American prison-its politics, its sex, its violence, its inability to control itself-and its idealization in American popular culture.&nbsp;This book investigates both the popular images of prison and the realities behind themÂ­: problems of control and discipline, maintenance and reform, power and sexuality. It conveys an awareness of the limits of human and institutional power, and of the symbolic and iconic qualities the 'Big House' has attained in Americaâs understanding of itself.</p>"
Capital Market Revolution: The Future Of Markets In An Online World,['Patrick Young'],"<p>The birth of the Capital Market Revolution is difficult to date precisely, but for many traders the first signs of change surfaces in bond futures. Open outcry had survived every innovation in history, but time had finally caught up with it. The revolution had begun.</p>
<p>Today, a whole industry is shifting from the physical to the virtual, and no one person or party's place in the trading chain is now assured, After the Capital Market Revolution there will be no floor, no fixed exchange and nowhere to hide from the rallying cries of e-markets.</p>
<blockquote>""It is good advice to read the foreword on most books written about Exchanges - and forget the rest. Not so with <i>Capital Market Revolution</i>.

From Edison To Enron: The Business Of Power And What It Means For The Future Of Electricity,['Richard Munson'],"<p>The blackout of 2003 illuminated just how dependent America is on electricity. It was not just that some 50 million people in eight states and Ontario were cut off from their televisions, microwaves, ATMs, and email. Without the electrical juice to keep their sockets alive, factory managers were forced to close production lines, city managers shut down water deliveries, grocery store clerks watched their frozen inventory slowly melt away. Economists estimated that the blackout cost Americans $5 billion even as energy analysts were predicting that a similar blackout could happen again. The catastrophe forced us to marvel at the unusual ability of sub-microscopic particles to move like waves inside a wire and cause bulbs to glow. It highlighted the complex requirements for managing the massive generators, transformers, transmission lines, and switch boxes needed to tap and deliver flowing electrons. It encouraged us to recognize the profound impact of electricity on all aspects of commerce and culture.</p>
<p>Such events as the blackout, the Enron debacle, and the California brownouts also reveal the cracks in a 100-year-old industry structure that have been building ever since Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and their contemporaries first managed to harness electricity and make it available to the masses, and tycoons, such as Sam Insull and George Norris, began to concentrate financial control and political influence. <i>From Edison to Enron</i> traces the controversial history of this $210 billion industry—the nation's largest—showcasing the key individuals, technological innovations, corporate machinations, and political battles that have been waged over its domination. Munson maintains that today's technological and regulatory infrastructure, as a function of its history, is a relic that has long outlived its usefulness; he points out that two-thirds of the fuel burned to generate electricity is lost, that Americans pay roughly $100 billion too much each year for heat and power, and that environmentally unfriendly generators are the nation's largest polluters. Meanwhile, innovations in technology and business models are being blocked by entrenched monopolies. Ultimately, Munson argues that current policies and practices, including those favored by the Bush Administration, are preventing entrepreneurs from producing more efficient, healthy, and sustainable power supplies. Moreover, he presents an agenda for business and policy reforms that will stimulate economic development in the United States and around the world.</p>"

Married To An Opposite: Making Personality Differences Work For You (psychology Religion And Spirituality),['Ron Shackelford'],"<p>The cause of clashes between spouses is not that they are from different planets. In fact, the colliding issues at hand may have nothing to do with gender. Seasoned marriage therapist Ron Shackelford explains that the issue at the heart of much marital discord is that the partners are opposite personality types. He cites a recent poll indicating that more than 50% of all couples bring different personality approaches to at least two of the four critical areas of marriage: decision-making, belief systems, means of energy replenishment, and approach to life. Understanding and appreciating these differences can not only bring new vigor and love to a marriage, but can also show the way to wonderful personal growth for each partner.</p>
<p>The core of this book builds on the work of Jung and Myers Briggs in the field of personality types, and there are occasional references to the general theology that has guided Shackelford, a retired pastor, through much of his life. The guide is clear, astute, and at times even amusing, making it an enlightening treatment that will strengthen insight, empathy, and respect for opposites—and ultimately revive marriages.</p>"
Georg Trakl's Poetry: Toward A Union Of Opposites,"['Detsch, Richard.']","<p>The chaotic mixture of elements in Trakl's poems is more apparent than real, this book argues, thus challenging the ""Orphic"" view of Walther Killy and his followers. A dream of unity—one of the most ancient dreams in human history—is in fact reflected in all of Trakl's work.</p>
<p>The recurring themes in Trakl's poetry are brought into focus through Dr. Detsch's literary, psychological, and philosophical analysis: the union of male and female in incest from the Jungian standpoint, the union of life and death from the Heideggerian standpoint and that of German Romanticism as represented by Novalis, the union of good and evil from the Dostoyevskian or Nietzschean standpoint, the mixture of images from the Goethean definition of symbolism.</p>
<p>Trakl (1887–1914) is presented as a poet whose lyric voice sounded a cry of hope in its deepest despair. As Dr. Detsch's generous quotations from the poet's work (in the original German) make clear, Georg Trakl sought poetic expression for a union of opposites.</p>"
Inventing The Charles River (the Mit Press),['Karl Haglund'],"<p>The Charles River Basin, extending nine miles upstream from the harbor, has been called Boston's ""Central Park."" Yet few realize that this apparently natural landscape is a totally fabricated public space. Two hundred years ago the Charles was a tidal river, edged by hundreds of acres of salt marshes and mudflats. Inventing the Charles River describes how, before the creation of the basin could begin, the river first had to be imagined as a single public space. The new esplanades along the river changed the way Bostonians perceived their city; and the basin, with its expansive views of Boston and Cambridge, became an iconic image of the metropolis.The book focuses on the precarious balance between transportation planning and stewardship of the public realm. Long before the esplanades were realized, great swaths of the river were given over to industrial enterprises and transportation — millponds, bridges, landfills, and a complex network of road and railway bridges. In 1929, Boston's first major highway controversy erupted when a four-lane road was proposed as part of a new esplanade. At twenty-year intervals, three riverfront road disputes followed, successively more complex and disputatious, culminating in the lawsuits over ""Scheme Z,""the Big Dig's plan for eighteen lanes of highway ramps and bridges over the river. More than three hundred photographs, maps, and drawings illustrate past and future visions for the Charles and document the river's place in Boston's history.</p>"
Shakespeare On Love And Lust,['Maurice Charney'],"<p>The complex and sometimes contradictory expressions of love in Shakespeare's works -- ranging from the serious to the absurd and back again -- arise primarily from his dramatic and theatrical flair rather than from a unified philosophy of love. Untangling his witty, bawdy (and ambiguous) treatment of love, sex, and desire requires a sharp eye and a steady hand. In <i>Shakespeare on Love and Lust,</i> noted scholar Maurice Charney delves deeply into Shakespeare's rhetorical and thematic development of this largest of subjects to reveal what makes his plays and poems resonate with contemporary audiences. The paradigmatic star-crossed lovers of <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> the comic confusions of couples wandering through the wood in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream,</i> Othello's tragic jealousy, the homoerotic ways Shakespeare played with cross-dressing on the Elizabethan stage -- Charney explores the world in which Shakespeare lived, and how it is reflected and transformed in the one he created.</p>
<p>While focusing primarily on desire between young lovers, Charney also explores themes of love in marriage (Brutus and Portia) and in same-sex pairings (Antonio and Sebastian). Against the conventions of Renaissance literature, Shakespeare qualified the Platonic view that true love transcends the physical. Instead, as Charney demonstrates, love in Shakespeare's work is almost always sexual as well as spiritual, and the full range of desire's dramatic possibilities is displayed.</p>
<p><i>Shakespeare on Love and Lust</i> begins by considering the ways in which Shakespeare drew upon and satirized the conventions of Petrarchan Renaissance love poetry in plays like <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> then explores how courtship is woven into the basic plot formula of the comedies. Next, Charney examines love in the tragedies and the enemies of love (Iago, for example). Later chapters cover the gender complications in such plays as <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> as well as the homoerotic themes woven into many of the poems and plays. Charney concludes with a lively discussion of paradoxes and ambivalences about love expressed by Shakespeare's word play and sexual innuendoes.</p>

Norms Of Nature: Naturalism And The Nature Of Functions (a Bradford Book),['Paul Sheldon Davies'],"<p>The components of living systems strike us as functional-as for the sake of certain ends—and as endowed with specific norms of performance. The mammalian eye, for example, has the function of perceiving and processing light, and possession of this property tempts us to claim that token eyes are supposed to perceive and process light. That is, we tend to evaluate the performance of token eyes against the norm described in the attributed functional property. Hence the norms of nature.What, then, are the norms of nature? Whence do they arise? Out of what natural properties or relations are they constituted? In Norms of Nature, Paul Sheldon Davies argues against the prevailing view that natural norms are constituted out of some form of historical success—usually success in natural selection. He defends the view that functions are nothing more than effects that contribute to the exercise of some more general systemic capacity. Natural functions exist insofar as the components of natural systems contribute to the exercise of systemic capacities. This is so irrespective of the system's history. Even if the mammalian eye had never been selected for, it would have the function of perceiving and processing light, because those are the effects that contribute to the exercise of the visual system. The systemic approach to conceptualizing natural norms, claims Davies, is superior to the historical approach in several important ways. Especially significant is that it helps us understand how the attribution of functions within the life sciences coheres with the methods and ontology of the natural sciences generally.</p>"

Community Prevention Trials For Alcohol Problems: Methodological Issues,['Harold D. Holder'],"<p>The contributors to this volume demonstrate that it is now possible to undertake community prevention trials of alcohol-involved problems with the same precision, good design, and careful planning that has characterized similar prevention trials for heart disease and cancer prevention. This is the first book to establish a scientific basis for the integration of research into program design and in program evaluation, making it possible to determine if community programs are effective or worth the money spent for them.</p>
<p>In part I, the contributors address issues of outcome measures, selection of relevant community interventions, utilization of appropriate research designs and analyses, and adjustment to social and political realities. Part II reviews definitions, perspectives, and issues that provide a conceptual base for the rest of the book. Also considered are the selection and measurement of alcohol problems that may be candidate outcome variables for a community intervention study. Part III summarizes the perspectives and prior experiences of community-based approaches in other health areas (including heart disease, cancer, and adolescent health) that may be applicable to the prevention of alcohol-related problems. Experiences and implications of alcohol-prevention projects in Ontario, Texas, and Rhode Island are discussed in part IV. Part V evaluates different experimental designs, methodologies, and relative risk regression models of community-based intervention programs in alcohol prevention. The two chapters in part VI discuss the dynamic social and political realities facing community prevention trials for alcohol problems and guidelines for undertaking such trials. This book will be useful for state and local prevention program planners and evaluators, researchers in alcohol and substance abuse, teachers of applied research methods or social program development and planning, and government policy makers.</p>"

Salsa: A Taste Of Hispanic Culture,['Rafael Falcon'],"<p>The daily routines, habits, beliefs, and values of the Hispanic culture that create unique human interactions in this society are revealed in this book. The book consists of 26 chapters relating to different themes that collectively provide an understanding of cultural responses. An anecdote is placed at the beginning of each chapter to assist the reader in understanding the more pedagogical information that follows. Reflected in this book is the reality that the Hispanic world covers a vast geographical area, and as such, is a mosaic of ethnic, religious, and historical backgrounds. Examples of diversity—the salsa, the taste of this culture—that makes this culture so unique are illustrated throughout the text. This book has been written with a wide range of readers in mind and will be of use to students on the secondary as well as undergraduate levels, teachers, social workers, and travelers.</p>"

Beyond the ethical demand,"['Løgstrup, K. E. (knud Ejler) , 1905-1981']","<p>The Danish theologian-philosopher K. E. Løgstrup is second in reputation in his homeland only to Søren Kierkegaard. He is best known outside Europe for his <i>The Ethical Demand</i>, first published in Danish in 1956 and published in an expanded English translation in 1997.</p>
<p><i>Beyond the Ethical Demand</i> contains excerpts, translated into English for the first time, from the numerous books and essays Løgstrup continued to write throughout his life. In the first essay, he engages the critical response to <i>The Ethical Demand,</i> clarifying, elaborating, or defending his original positions. In the next three essays, he extends his contention that human ethics “demands” that we are concerned for the other by introducing the crucial concept of “sovereign expressions of life.” Like Levinas, Løgstrup saw in the phenomenon of “the other” the ground for his ethics. In his later works he developed this concept of “the sovereign expressions of life,” spontaneous phenomena such as trust, mercy, and sincerity that are inherently other-regarding. The last two essays connect his ethics with political life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest in Løgstrup in the English-speaking academic community continues to grow, and these important original sources will be essential tools for scholars exploring the further implications of his ethics and phenomenology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“K. E. Løgstrup’s work undoubtedly made in his time an original contribution to the field of moral philosophy and philosophy of religion. This translation makes extracts from his later publications on moral philosophy accessible to an English-speaking audience. I am again impressed by the depth of his ideas, which are certainly not outdated and still relevant for contemporary debates in moral philosophy.” —<b>Bert Musschenga, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Making a large part of Knud Løgstrup’s legacy accessible&nbsp;to the English-speaking public&nbsp;is an event of enormous cultural, philosophical and political importance—and we are all in debt to&nbsp;his disciple, Kies van Kooten Niekerk, and the University Press of Notre Dame, for making it happen.&nbsp;Løgstrup, alongside few other giants of 20th Century ethical thought, like Emmanuel Levinas or Hans Jonas, anticipated and articulated all the major challenges and urgent tasks&nbsp;with which the coming century is likely to&nbsp;confront&nbsp;the moral self.&nbsp;Our ethical discourse was all the poorer so far for being barred access to his findings and proposition. This will no longer be the case.” —<b>Zygmunt&nbsp;Bauman, emeritus, University of Leeds</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The publication of an English translation of Knut Eljert Løgstrup's later works in ethics provides a wider readership with the opportunity to better understand his important contribution to ethics in the second half of the last century. With his notion of the <i>Sovereign Expressions of Life</i> Løgstrup articulates his rejection of moral atomism that has become influential in recent times. The introduction and annotation by Kees van Kooten Niekerk are very helpful to see how Løgstrup's thought developed beyond <i>The Ethical Demand.” —</i><b>Hans S. Reinders, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam</b></p>

Financial Markets And Monetary Policy (the Mit Press),['Jeffrey A. Frankel'],"<p>The decade of the 1980s left many central bankers disillusioned with monetarism, so that the question of the optimal nominal anchor remains an open one. In this second collection of his writings on financial markets (the first, On Exchange Rates, covered international finance),Jeffrey Frankel turns his attention to domestic markets, with special attention to how national monetary policy is handled. The fifteen papers are divided into three sections, each introduced by the author. They cover, respectively, optimal portfolio diversification, indicators of expected inflation, and the determination of monetary policy in the face of uncertainty.In the first section,Frankel explores what information the theory of optimal portfolio diversification can give the macroeconomist. In the second section, he considers what economic variables central bankers might use to gauge whether monetary policy is too tight or too loose. And in the final section, he looks at the range of uncertainty over policy effects and how that complicates coordination of macroeconomic policymaking. The book concludes with a sympathetic analysis of nominal GDP targeting.</p>"
Dignity: The Essential Role It Plays In Resolving Conflict,['Donna Hicks Ph.d'],"<p>The desire for dignity is universal and powerful. It is a motivating force behind all human interaction—in families, in communities, in the business world, and in relationships at the international level. When dignity is violated, the response is likely to involve aggression, even violence, hatred, and vengeance. On the other hand, when people treat one another with dignity, they become more connected and are able to create more meaningful relationships. Surprisingly, most people have little understanding of dignity, observes Donna Hicks in this important book. She examines the reasons for this gap and offers a new set of strategies for becoming aware of dignity's vital role in our lives and learning to put dignity into practice in everyday life.</p>
<p>Drawing on her extensive experience in international conflict resolution and on insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the author explains what the elements of dignity are, how to recognize dignity violations, how to respond when we are not treated with dignity, how dignity can restore a broken relationship, why leaders must understand the concept of dignity, and more. Hicks shows that by choosing dignity as a way of life, we open the way to greater peace within ourselves and to a safer and more humane world for all.</p>"
For Better or for Worse: The Marriage of Science and Government in the United States,['Alfred K. Mann'],"<p>The development of an American science establishment -- today an amalgam of scientists, engineers, universities, industrial laboratories, and federal science agencies -- began early in the twentieth century when the federal government began to invest in a national scientific infrastructure. During World War II this investment swelled to colossal proportions. At present, the yearly federal investment in basic science and technology amounts to about thirty-five billion dollars. How did this complex marriage between science and government occur? How will increasing economic pressures affect its future?</p><p>In this engaging overview of the science establishment and its relationship with the federal government, renowned physicist Alfred K. Mann details the reasons behind the creation of the four nonmilitary federal science agencies that are responsible for the bulk of this budget and are the principal supporters of scientific research and technology in American universities. Looking into each agency, he elucidates the ways in which decisions were made, whose interests were at stake, and the resulting discoveries, mishaps, and bureaucratic mazes that were constructed in the name of research.</p><p>Mann interweaves fascinating stories that grew out of the scientific enterprise:</p><p>â¢ the allies' invention during World War II of the proximity fuse and its tremendous battlefield success,</p><p>â¢ the first use of blood plasma in World War II field hospitals,</p><p>â¢ the invention of radar,</p><p>â¢ strategic policies of the Cold War,</p><p>â¢ the double helix of DNA,</p><p>â¢ space explorations and the space missions,</p><p>â¢ modern global positioning systems (GPS),</p><p>â¢ satellite surveillance, and</p><p>â¢ recent declassification of covert operations.</p><p>Charting the origins and operations of a remarkable collaboration, <i>For Better or for Worse</i> encompasses many of the key scientific discoveries of our time and offers a renewed vision of the future direction of the United States science establishment.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"

"Gm Passes Ford, 1918-1938: Designing The General Motors Performance-control System","['Kuhn, Arthur J.']","<p>The dramatic story of how upstart General Motors got ahead of pioneer Ford—and has stayed ahead—is told here along with an explanation of GM's success. This book argues that GM won the race by designing a successful performance-control system, in harmony with cybernetic principles and systems theory, under the leadership of Alfred Sloan and his expert team. Henry Ford, the passionate individualist, meanwhile established a losing tradition described by the author as anti-team, anti-expert, and anti-system. GM's recent difficulties, according to Dr. Kuhn, are a result of its lapse from early policies.</p>
<p>In 1921 Ford held the largest share of a market ever attained by a single manufacturer, 59%, while GM had slipped from about 20% to 15%. Starting in 1924, GM climbed to over 40% of the market, a share it has held ever since, while Ford fell to about 10%. GM has outperformed Ford even more sharply in return to shareholders. The author, however, does not gloss over GM's weaknesses, especially its ""laggard performance"" in consumer safety and its ""tunnel vision"" in product development.</p>
<p>Although the concepts of ""steermanship"" and ""inquiring systems"" were not set forth theoretically until after 1938, GM's leaders applied these concepts organizationally during the boom-and-bust 1920s and 1930s. Most of the book describes the affinities and clashes of personality leading to GM's adoption and Ford's rejection of a performance-control system. The final chapters describe GM's generally superior performance but show why GM, in spite of that, has had difficulties in meeting recent challenges. Here is exciting history with a compelling message.</p>"
Economic effects of the government budget,"['Elhanan Helpman', 'Assaf Razin', 'and  Efraim Sadka']","<p>The effects of a government's budget on society and the political economy are of considerable concern to economists as well as to consumers and taxpayers. The original contributions in this book analyze all of the budget's components expenditures, revenues, the deficit - with a special emphasis on issues that have assumed increasing importance over the last decade or so, such as intergenerational transfers of debt and declines in corporate tax revenues.Chapters deal with both microeconomic and macroeconomic aspects of the effects of budgets, and demonstrate how budgetary policies affect inflation, efficiency, the balance of payments, exchange rates, and the decision-making process.The contributions are grouped into five sections. The first covers the revenue side of the budget - taxation policy and its interaction with emigration, corporate tax revenues, personal income taxes, and fiscal policies. The second takes up intergenerational transfers, consumption decisions, and Ricardian equivalence and neutrality. Budget deficits and optimal policies, inflation and its relationship to budget deficits are examined in parts three and four.The book concludes by looking at stabilization in open economies, and includes treatments of the consequences of balance-of-payments crises, exchange rate management under uncertainty, and foreign exchange operations.Elhanan Helpman, Assaf Razin, and Efraim Sadka are professors of economics at Tel-Aviv University.</p>"
Astronomy of the Ancients,"['Kenneth Brecher', 'Michael Feirtag']","<p>The eight articles and dozens of photographs and drawings in this book introduce the reader to the ancient astronomers - their observatories, their instruments, and their explorations of the awesome regularities (and shocking irregularities) that appear in the sky.The authors draw upon a wide range of disciplines - history, archaeology, technology, even mythology in discussing their subjects. This book is one endeavor toward a reconstruction of the past of the human mind,using all available evidence: text, myth, spade; yet, there is a difference. That difference is that in the world of the heavens there are real phenomena, striking or subtle, enduring or transient,which can be invoked today to challenge or to support the inferences of the archeologist,epigrapher, historian, or mythologist.The authors go back to one sole source: real human beings watching the real sky; if we do so reflectively, we can share at every glance the roots of the power of human thought, the thought which once married science and literature, art and number, wonder and insight, when thoughtful people were still rather few under this ceaseless sky.</p>"
Covering Clinton: The President And The Press In The 1990s,['Joseph R. Hayden'],"<p>The end of the 1990s saw increasing criticism of the media's treatment of the scandals in Washington. Critics complained that journalists either had not covered the political crisis well, that they had bungled it, or that they had simply blown it out of proportion. Some went so far as to call the situation Pressgate. As Hayden points out, however, the larger question remained: What was Clinton's overall relationship with the media?</p>
<p>Hayden examines presidential-press relationships in the 1990s, focusing first on the 1992 campaign, then on issues and events over Clinton's two terms. He analyzes the press response to the programs of the Clinton era as well as the scandals, the roles of consultants like James Carville, the effectiveness of various press secretaries, and the use of pollsters like Dick Morris. He also examines the fate of the First Amendment in the 1990s and how Clinton responded to freedom of expression concerns. This analysis will be of interest to media specialists as well as the general public concerned with contemporary Washington politics and journalism.</p>"
Institutions And Reform In Africa: The Public Choice Perspective,['John Mukum Mbaku Esq.'],"<p>The end of the Cold War, the cessation of superpower rivalry, and the demise of apartheid in South Africa have offered Africans another opportunity to engage in effective institutional reform and state reconstruction. This book emphasizes the importance of institutions to economic growth and development and, using public choice theory, provides guidelines that can be used to initiate and implement an effective people-driven institutional reform program on the continent.</p>"
The Political Economy Of Ethiopia: (sais Studies On Africa),['Marina Ottaway'],"<p>The essays collected here evolved from a two-day conference on Ethiopia held at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. Written by both academics and Ethiopians who have participated personally in the events they discuss, the papers describe and interpret the Ethiopian revolution and explore its successes, failures, and intrinsic qualities. The contributors express a variety of viewpoints and approaches to the current crisis situation in Ethiopia, demonstrating that although the 15-year revolution has failed to measurably improve the lot of Ethiopians, Ethiopia's history, demographics, and climate have also been important contributing factors. A number of articles deal with aspects of the political crisis while others analyze the economic crisis, looking at present problems and their historical roots. Taken together, these essays make a major contribution to our understanding of the persistent problems faced by Ethiopia today.</p>
<p>Following the editor's introduction, the volume is divided into three sections. In Part I, four papers explore the Ethiopian state and the problem of power. Individual chapters examine such issues as change and continuity in Ethiopian politics, decisions and elections, and the question of rural transformation. Part II looks at different facets of the national question, now or in the past--the character of the leadership, the concept of government, and the decision-making process. The third section analyzes the current economic crisis in two papers which discuss Ethiopia's agricultural crisis and development strategy. The concluding chapter presents an overall perspective on revolution, nationality, and the Ethiopian state. Students of political economy, African studies, and economic development will find <i>The Political Economy of Ethiopia</i> illuminating reading.</p>"
"Anagogic Qualities Of Literature (yearbook Of Comparative Criticism, Volume Iv)","['Strelka, Joseph']","<p>The essays in this volume deal with the relationship between belles-lettres and mystical and esoteric traditions, as well as with the methods used in literary criticism to reveal, describe, and judge these relationships. The term “anagogic” is used in this volume in a somewhat narrower sense than it is by Northrop Frye and, standing as a synonym for “mystic,” refers to the doctrine of direct knowledge of “God” or spiritual truth that is attainable through immediate intuition, and it reaches from speculative Christian mysticism and Gnostic traditions to Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Tantrism.</p>
<p>A cross section of representative examples of world literature demonstrates the different methods of approach as well as the differences in patterns, forms, and degrees of profundity between various traditions.</p>

Lockerbie: The Story And The Lessons,['Rodney Wallis'],"<p>The explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, should never have happened. Wallis, who has extensive, direct, personal knowledge of aviation security matters gained from his position at the crossroads of security information and the industry's endeavors to combat aviation terrorism, had warned the industry one year before the bombing that the interline element of baggage represented the prime opportunity for terrorist activity and had urged the adoption of passenger and baggage matching, a system that he had helped to develop. Mandated by the FAA for use at high risk airports, it was the feature missing from Pan AM's activity at Frankfort, an omission so cruelly exploited by the bombers. Wallis argues that the priority given by governments to technological solutions to the continuing terrorist threat puts the flying public at unnecessary risk every day.</p>
<p>This volume brings together all of the facts surrounding the sabotage of Flight 103, including the investigation and the civil litigation in which so much of the story unfolded for the first time. It uncovers the fundamental weaknesses in Pan AM's communication and management policies. Wallis supports the policy that politics are politics and explores the possibility that U.S. and U.K. policy towards a neutral trial for the two Libyans indicted for the bombing, which may have been affected by the wider scenario of Middle East politics rather than simple justice for the victims of Lockerbie. Although the tragedy has led to improvements in defense technology for use against acts of aviation sabotage, these methods have yet to be applied universally.</p>"
The First Amendment--the Challenge Of New Technology,['Elena Mier Y Teran'],"<p>The First Amendment to the Constitution, assuring freedom of speech and freedom of the press, was ratified nearly 200 years ago. Since that time, the amendment has maintained its tradition off freedom while accomodating the introduction of technologies that the framers of the Constitution could not have envisioned, including the telephone, radio and television, and the communications satellite. Recent dramatic technological advances in communications, however, will subject the First Amendment to stresses exceeding anything in its past history. <i>The First Amendment--The Challenge of New Technology</i> is a collection of papers by leaders in the communications field examining the flexibility of the First Amendment in coping with the miracles of modern communications technology.</p>
<p>The outcome of the San Diego Communications Council Conference on August 30, 1987, this book includes the contributions of a broad mix of talents and experiences: practitioners in newspaper, magazines, broadcasting and cable; regulators and lawmakers, communications theorists and educators. The contributors study a wide range of First Amendment issues, including the rights of the media, national security, and the rights to privacy. Students, scholars, and practitioners of communications or constitutional law, as well as policymakers or anyone interested in the future of freedom of speech will find <i>The First Amendment -- The Challenge of New Technology</i> an invaluable resource.</p>"
Mixing Memory And Desire: The Waste Land And British Novels,['Fred Crawford'],"<p>The first comprehensive treatment of how ""an American poet so profoundly shaped or affected the modern British novel,"" this—in the words of James E. Miller, Jr.—details ""an extraordinary and even exciting literary fact, worthy of full documentation and exploration. ""The book begins with an introduction describing how <em>The Waste Land</em> blew into England in 1922, as William Empson said, ""not unlike an east wind."" Although the critics disagree over what the poem means, all writers since 1922 have felt its influence in some degree, even if only in rejecting it. The author then traces echoes of <em>The Waste Land</em> in 17 major British novelists, confining himself to cases where the evidence is too strong to be explained as coincidence.</p>
<p>The authors are divided into three groups. Part I assesses the poem's early impact, as seen in the work of writers already established at the time of its publication. Novelists discussed in this section include E. M. Forster, D. H. Lawrence, and Aldous Huxley. There is also a chapter on Richard Aldinton that contains a fascinating revaluation, based on extensive research, of Aldington's personal quarrel with Eliot. Part II examines the different sort of influence <em>The Waste Land</em> exerted on novelists who came to prominence in the decade before World War II. For these writers—among them Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell, Christopher Isherwood, C. S. Lewis, and Graham Greene—the poem was a basic part of their literary education, and was therefore woven more deeply, and frequently, into the fabric of their work.</p>
<p>Part III focuses on two writers of the postwar era, Iris Murdoch and Anthony Burgess. With the rest of their generation they had been forced to recognize a horror more oppressive than the banality and blight of Eliot's ""Unreal City,"" yet they found in the <em>The Waste Land</em> images and meanings so compelling that the poem retains an undeniable presence in their work. In his conclusion, Dr. Crawford attributes <em>The Waste Land</em>'s uniquely powerful impact to four qualities: its timing in providing ""prototypes for almost every modern problem""; its challenging elusiveness; its ambiguity, which ""allows every reader to draw his own conclusion regarding the poem's meaning""; and its haunting symbols and descriptions. The ""rhetoric of fiction"" is especially sensitive to such qualities. The result is the British novelists ""have helped to 'define' <em>The Waste Land</em> by their varied use of it.""</p>"

Composer's Voices From Ives To Ellington: An Oral History Of American Music,"['Perlis, Vivian']","<p>The first decades of the twentieth century were a fertile and fascinating period in American musical history. This book and the two CDs that accompany it present an exceptional collection of interviews with and about the most significant musical figures of the era. Tapping the unparalleled materials contained in the Oral History American Music archive at Yale University, <i>Composers’ Voices from Ives to Ellington</i> is a unique account of what it was like for musicians and composers to live and work in those years. It is also the story of the making of the archive, as told by Vivian Perlis, who personally conducted many of the interviews.</p>
<p>Music aficionados can now hear Eubie Blake describe the birth of ragtime or listen to a firsthand account of how Ira Gershwin came to write those famous lines in “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off.” In-depth interviews with such figures as Henry Cowell, Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland, and Duke Ellington are included in the book, which also features chapter introductions and fascinating sidebars, illustrations, and anecdotes throughout.

Living Downstream: An Ecologist's Personal Investigation Of Cancer And The Environment,['Sandra Steingraber'],"<p>The first edition of <i>Living Downstream</i>—an exquisite blend of precise science and engaging narrative—set a new standard for scientific writing. Poet, biologist, and cancer survivor, Steingraber uses all three kinds of experience to investigate the links between cancer and environmental toxins.</p>
<p>The updated science in this exciting new edition strengthens the case for banning poisons now pervasive in our air, our food, and our bodies. Because synthetic chemicals linked to cancer come mostly from petroleum and coal, Steingraber shows that investing in green energy also helps prevent cancer. Saving the planet becomes a matter of saving ourselves and an issue of human rights. A documentary film based on the book will coincide with publication.</p>"
Anton Rubinstein: A Life In Music (russian Music Studies),['Philip S. Taylor'],"<p>The first modern biography in English of Russian composer-pianist Anton Rubinstein, this book places Rubinstein within the context of Russian and western European musical culture during the late 19th century, exploring his rise to international fame from humble origins in Bessarabia, as well as his subsequent rapid decline and marginalization in later musical culture. Taylor provides a balanced account of Rubinstein’s life and his career as a piano virtuoso, conductor, composer, and as the founder of Russia’s first conservatory. Widely considered the virtuosic heir to Liszt, and recognized internationally as an equivalent cultural icon, he performed with most leading musicians of the day, including Liszt himself, Joachim, Clara Schumann, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski, Saint-Saens, and Ysaÿe.</p>"
Touch,['Tiffany Field'],"<p>The first sensory input in life comes from the sense of touch while a baby is still in the womb, and touch continues to be the primary means of learning about the world throughout infancy, well into childhood. Touch is critical for children's growth, development, and health, as well as for adults' physical and mental well-being. Yet American society, claims Tiffany Field, is dangerously touch-deprived.Field, a leading authority on touch and touch therapy, begins this accessible book with an overview of the sociology and anthropology of touching and the basic psychophysical properties of touch. She then reports recent research results on the value of touch therapies, such as massage therapy, for various conditions, including asthma, cancer, autism, and eating disorders. She emphasizes the need for a change in societal attitudes toward touching,particularly among those who work with children.</p>"
In The Business Of Child Care,"['Auerbach, Judith D.']","<p>The focus of this short, well-written, and interesting book is employer support for child-care provision in the US. Topics include the need for and history of child care outside the home, the different types of support offered by employers (with examples), and the pros and cons for providing that support. An argument against expecting government assistance is presented. For Auerbach, a sociologist, an important consequence of the development of employer support is the legitimization of mothers working outside the home and children being cared for by nonfamily members. As a whole, this book provides a concise historical survey of this narrow topic. <i>Choice</i></p>
<p>The status of women in the public domain has been limited by ideas of proper roles for women, particularly regarding childcare. One result of such cultural notions is the limited supply of extra-familial child care, even with the rise of significant participation in the labor force of mothers with young children. With the aid of a rigorous methodology, In the Business of Child Care surpasses the traditional descriptive account of child care to provide theoretical discussions on the business of child care assistance. Sociological analyses of employer supported child care, and of the relationship between cultural ideology and the reality of women's employment, make this volume a land-mark text for scholars and students of sociology, social welfare, women's studies, as well as for public policy makers, personnel administrators, and child care workers.</p>"

PacMan: Behind the Scenes with Manny Pacquiao--The Greatest Pound-For-Pound Fighter in the World,"['Poole', 'Gary Andrew']","<p>The GenSan boys sold doughnuts and worked construction (once Pacquiao didn't eat for four days because his employer didn't pay him). If one member of the group had money, rice was purchased for the group. Manny was so good-hearted that he would often forgo his share so someone else could have more. When other boxers would leave the gym as a group to get a bite, Pacquiao would hang back, never wanting to be a charity case. In a letter to his mother, he told her not to worry: Life is difficult here. There are times when I eat rice only once a day.</p><p>It amazes me that he is the same guy that walked in the first day, says trainer Freddie Roach. His work ethic is exactly the same. Guys get comfortable; guys get lazy after winning a world title. Guys get cocky. He hasn't. He trains his ass off every day. He has many distractions outside the ring, a lot of chaos, a lot of drama, but he can separate that. Whatever else is going on in his life, he leaves it outside.</p>"
The Shameful Peace: How French Artists And Intellectuals Survived The Nazi Occupation,['Frederic Spotts'],"<p>The German occupation of France from 1940 to 1945 presented wrenching challenges for the nation’s artists and intellectuals. Some were able to flee the country; those who remained—including Gide and Céline, Picasso and Matisse, Cortot and Messiaen, and Cocteau and Gabin—responded in various ways. This fascinating book is the first to provide a full account of how France’s artistic leaders coped under the crushing German presence. Some became heroes, others villains; most were simply survivors.</p>
<p>Filled with anecdotes about the artists, composers, writers, filmmakers, and actors who lived through the years of occupation, the book illuminates the disconcerting experience of life and work within a cultural prison. Frederic Spotts uncovers Hitler’s plan to pacify the French through an active cultural life, and examines the unexpected vibrancy of opera, ballet, painting, theater, and film in both the Occupied and Vichy Zones. In view of the longer-term goal to supplant French with German culture, Spotts offers moving insight into the predicament of French artists as they fought to preserve their country’s cultural and national identity.</p>"
Introduction To Machine Learning (adaptive Computation And Machine Learning Series),['Ethem Alpaydin'],"<p>The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already,including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. The second edition of Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. In order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions, it discusses many methods from different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The text covers such topics as supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory,parametric methods, multivariate methods, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, and reinforcement learning. New to the second edition are chapters on kernel machines, graphical models, and Bayesian estimation; expanded coverage of statistical tests in a chapter on design and analysis of machine learning experiments;case studies available on the Web (with downloadable results for instructors); and many additional exercises. All chapters have been revised and updated. Introduction to Machine Learning can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming,probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.</p>"
Poor People's Social Movement Organizations: The Goal Is To Win,['Melvin F. Hall'],"<p>The goal of this book is to join social movement analysis with collective action theory. To that end, the author introduces the organizational empowerment model of collective action. All social movement theories lack a discussion of the influence of movement organization on the tactics of an organization. A national survey of social movement organizations is employed to develop a model of how the organizational features of the local group, competition among social movement organizations, the political settings of the organization, and organizational empowerment influence collective action style. This model will allow for testing some long held assumptions about organizational change as well as assumptions about the efficacy of poor people organized to achieve change.</p>"
Holding Government Bureaucracies Accountable,"['Rosen', 'Bernard']","<p>The growth in power of government bureaucracies is one of the more profound developments of 20th-century society. Bureaucracies impact the quality of life of every person in this country and many millions outside American borders. The president, governors, mayors, legislators, judges, and the public now are increasingly concerned with how bureaucracies are using their power, and accountability is at the heart of these concerns. For what and to whom are bureaucracies accountable? This acclaimed text examines these questions, primarily in the context of the federal bureaucracy. Building upon the second edition of the text, Rosen updated the entire work to incorporate significant subsequent developments. Among the most important are the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994. These three laws, with the Clinton administration's National Performance Review initiative, could substantially improve performance and accountability. The text clearly and systematically examines issues of accountability that are of concern to students and researchers as well as policymakers in the area of public administration.</p>"
Belle Gunness: The Lady Bluebeard,['Janet L. Langlois'],"<p>The Guinness Book of World Records has in twelve editions listed Belle Gunness under the category Most Prolific Murderers. She earned the epithet the Lady Bluebeard because she is believed to have killed as many as twenty spouses. She settled on a farm on the outskirts of LaPorte, Indiana, in 1901. Over the next seven years it is believed that she killed a husband, children, and an indeterminate number of would-be suitors who answered her matrimonial advertisements. Through symbolic analysis of the folk art about the murderess-anecdotes, personal-experience stories, legends, ballads, and plays and skits-Langlois discovers an integrated symbol system through which the community comes to various and contradictory conclusions about the deviant woman, deviancy in general, and social changes.</p>"
Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins Of A Modern English Lesbian Culture,"['Doan, Laura L. , 1951-']","<p>The highly publicized obscenity trial of Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i> (1928) is generally recognized as the crystallizing moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian culture, marking a great divide between innocence and deviance, private and public, New Woman and Modern Lesbian. Yet despite unreserved agreement on the importance of this cultural moment, previous studies often reductively distort our reading of the formation of early twentieth-century lesbian identity, either by neglecting to examine in detail the developments leading up to the ban or by framing events in too broad a context against other cultural phenomena.</p>
<p><i>Fashioning Sapphism</i> locates the novelist Radclyffe Hall and other prominent lesbians -- including the pioneer in women's policing, Mary Allen, the artist Gluck, and the writer Bryher -- within English modernity through the multiple sites of law, sexology, fashion, and literary and visual representation, thus tracing the emergence of a modern English lesbian subculture in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Drawing on extensive new archival research, the book interrogates anew a range of myths long accepted without question (and still in circulation) concerning, to cite only a few, the extent of homophobia in the 1920s, the strategic deployment of sexology against sexual minorities, and the rigidity of certain cultural codes to denote lesbianism in public culture.</p>

Responding To America's Homeless: Public Policy Alternatives,"['F. Stevens Redburn', 'Terry F. Buss']","<p>The homeless have become more and more numerous and visible in our society. Responding to America's Homeless presents the most complete, up-to-date scientific evidence concerning the nature, extent, and causes of homelessness. Using an unprecedented survey of 1,000 homeless individuals and families, as well as previous national, local, and scholarly research, the authors draw a vivid portrait of the homeless population and their needs. They challenge the widely held view that most homeless are mentally ill, proposing an original classification of the homeless based on needs for various forms of assistance. On the basis of this empirical research, the authors evaluate current public policies for dealing with the homeless and present alternative plans aimed at returning homeless people to more normal, secure circumstances.</p>"

The Heavenly Contract: Ideology And Organization In Pre-revolutionary Puritanism,"['Zaret, David.']","<p>The idea of a heavenly contract, uniting God and humanity in a bargain of salvation, emerged as the keystone of Puritan theology in early modern England. Yet this concept, with its connotations of exchange and reciprocity, runs counter to other tenets of Calvinism, such as predestination, that were also central to Puritan thought. With bold analytic intelligence, David Zaret explores this puzzling conflict between covenant theology and pure Calvinism. In the process he demonstrates that popular beliefs and activities had tremendous influence on Puritan religion.</p>"

"The Imperial Mantle: The United States, Decolonization, And The Third",['David D. Newsom'],"<p>The Imperial Mantle The United States, Decolonization, and the Third World</p>
<p>David D. Newsom</p>
<p>A probing analysis of relations between the United States and the Third World in the post–World War II era.</p>
<p>""To understand why some people in the Third World like to throw rocks at us, read this book."" —Richard B. Parker</p>
<p>Many Americans are bewildered by the hostilities and even hatred toward the United States on the part of newly independent Third World nations. Experienced diplomat and scholar David D. Newsom seeks to understand these animosities in this thoughtful review of U.S. relations with the Third World since World War II. The Imperial Mantle traces the upheavals in the postwar era as the peoples of British, Dutch, Belgian, and Portuguese empires demanded and gained independence. As the most powerful leader of the free world, despite its anti-colonial heritage, the United States tended to inherit the imperial mantle in this period, becoming the focus of both expectations and demands from the new nations. How the United States lived up to these expectations, and how it responded to the challenge of leadership and the burdens of being the dominant world power are the central issues in this book. It is must reading for anyone who wants to understand the foreign policy challenges that America will face in the 21st century.</p>
<p>David D. Newsom, a former Under Secretary and Assistant Secretary of State, served as U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Indonesia, and the Philippines. After retiring from the Foreign Service, he became Director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy and Professor and Dean at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and Professor in the Department of Government and Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia, where he is a senior fellow at the Miller Center.

Toxic Exposures: Contested Illnesses And The Environmental Health Movement,['Phil Brown'],"<p>The increase in environmentally induced diseases and the loosening of regulation and safety measures have inspired a massive challenge to established ways of looking at health and the environment. Communities with disease clusters, women facing a growing breast cancer incidence rate, and people of color concerned about the asthma epidemic have become critical of biomedical models that emphasize the role of genetic makeup and individual lifestyle practices. Likewise, scientists have lost patience with their colleagues' and government's failure to adequately address environmental health issues and to safeguard research from corporate manipulation.</p>
<p>Focusing specifically on breast cancer, asthma, and Gulf War-related health conditions-""contested illnesses"" that have generated intense debate in the medical and political communities-Phil Brown shows how these concerns have launched an environmental health movement that has revolutionized scientific thinking and policy. Before the last three decades of widespread activism regarding toxic exposures, people had little opportunity to get information. Few sympathetic professionals were available, the scientific knowledge base was weak, government agencies were largely unprepared, laypeople were not considered bearers of useful knowledge, and ordinary people lacked their own resources for discovery and action.</p>
<p>Brown argues that organized social movements are crucial in recognizing and acting to combat environmental diseases. His book draws on environmental and medical sociology, environmental justice, environmental health science, and social movement studies to show how citizen-science alliances have fought to overturn dominant epidemiological paradigms. His probing look at the ways scientific findings are made available to the public and the changing nature of policy offers a new perspective on health and the environment and the relationship among people, knowledge, power, and authority.</p>

Target Hitler: The Plots To Kill Adolf Hitler,"['Duffy, James P. , 1941-']","<p>The infamous reign of Adolf Hitler occurred half a century ago, but how he managed to escape so many attempts on his life remains a mystery. <i>Target Hitler</i> addresses the subject anew and is the only book for general audiences which recounts this fascinating topic in depth. Duffy and Ricci have pulled together the known and hitherto unknown facts about the German resistance to create an absorbing tale.</p>
<p>Although many Germans harbored deep hatred for the Nazis and risked their lives trying to topple the regime, most of these would-be assassins were forgotten or slighted in the history of that period. The authors wish to right that wrong. This eminently readable narrative concentrates on the efforts of a group of conspirators within the German army who first began to plot against Hitler in the fall of 1938, and whose story culminates in the famous July 1944 bombing. Bound together by their religious beliefs and a determination to rid their homeland of the Nazi scourge, some of these men were generals, one a field marshal. It is intriguing to think how the course of world history would have been altered had these men accomplished their mission. That fate denied such an outcome is tragic. But now, at least the bravery of those who tried to rid the world of the horror Hitler inflicted will be remembered as the heroes they are.</p>"
Unlocking The Clubhouse: Women In Computing (the Mit Press),"['Jane Margolis', 'Allan Fisher']","<p>The information technology revolution is transforming almost every aspect of society,but girls and women are largely out of the loop. Although women surf the Web in equal numbers to men and make a majority of online purchases, few are involved in the design and creation of new technology. It is mostly men whose perspectives and priorities inform the development of computing innovations and who reap the lion's share of the financial rewards. As only a small fraction of high school and college computer science students are female, the field is likely to remain a ""male clubhouse,"" absent major changes.In Unlocking the Clubhouse, social scientist Jane Margolis and computer scientist and educator Allan Fisher examine the many influences contributing to the gender gap in computing. The book is based on interviews with more than 100 computer science students of both sexes from Carnegie Mellon University, a major center of computer science research, over a period of four years, as well as classroom observations and conversations with hundreds of college and high school faculty. The interviews capture the dynamic details of the female computing experience, from the family computer kept in a brother's bedroom to women's feelings of alienation in college computing classes. The authors investigate the familial, educational, and institutional origins of the computing gender gap. They also describe educational reforms that have made a dramatic difference at Carnegie Mellon — where the percentage of women entering the School of Computer Science rose from 7% in 1995 to 42% in 2000 — and at high schools around the country.</p>"
Two Revolutions In Economic Policy: The First Economic Reports Of Presidents Kennedy And Reagan,['James Tobin'],"<p>The juxtaposition of Kennedy and Reagan approaches to economic problems is particularly instructive in that they express the two major - and quite different - approaches of macroeconomic policy in the past three decades: the 1962 Kennedy Camelot which relied on traditional Keynesian economics, and the 1982 Reagan program which called for a supplyside solution to the country's economic difficulties. From today's vantage point it is useful to compare what these two different groups of economic advisors planned to do, what they did, and what the results were.James Tobin, who received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1981, is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale. His Essays in Economics, collected in three volumes, are available from The MIT Press. Murray L. Weidenbaum is Director of the Center for the Study of American Business and Mallinckrodt Distinguished University Professor at Washington University.</p>"
"Crumbling Empire: The German Defeat In The East, 1944",['Samuel W. Mitcham Jr.'],"<p>The last place a German soldier wanted to be in 1944 was the Russian front. That summer, Stalin hurled into battle more than six million men and 9,000 tanks, supported by 16,000 fighters and bombers and more than 12,800 guns and rocket launchers. Despite this massive effort and the resulting decimation of German forces, events on the Eastern Front are largely neglected by historians who focus instead on German defeats in Normandy and the Ardennes. This account details the massive battles on the Eastern Front from the summer of 1944 until the fall of Budapest in early 1945, a period when Hitler lost the majority of his conquered Eastern territories and many of his best remaining divisions.</p>
<p>To destroy the Third Reich, the Allies needed to defeat the German Wehrmacht militarily, and the decisive victories of this period occurred on the Russian Front. More German soldiers were lost in White Russia than at Stalingrad; more troops were lost in Rumania in a brief ten days than in the entire Normandy campaign; and German losses in Hungary were greater than the Battle of the Bulge. The most mobile army in the world in 1940, the German Army was the <i>least</i> mobile by 1944, and Hitler's stand fast and fortified place policies imposed a paralysis that neither senior German generals nor the High Command of the Army were able to overcome. Outnumbered 3 to 1 in men, 5 to 1 in tanks, and 20 to 1 in airplanes, the German Army was slaughtered, as casualties mounted and the empire crumbled.</p>"
"With The Hungarian Independence Movement, 1943-1947: An Eyewitness Account",['Istvan Szent-Miklosy'],"<p>The Magyar Fuggetlensegi Mozgalom (Hungarian Independence Movement or MFM) played an important role in the history of Hungary in the latter part of World War II and the years immediately after. The bulk of this volume is based on Szent-Miklosy's personal experiences as a participant in the activities of the MFM. The author, the last survivor in the West of the MFM, describes the unsuccessful attempts of the group first to assist efforts to obtain an armistice with the Allies and to save the Jewish population of Budapest, and then to introduce a Western-style democratic political system into Hungary. He also identifies the causes of the movement's failures, causes that lay not just in the actions of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, but also in the ambivalent foreign policies of France, Great Britain, and the United States, as well as in the shortcomings of Hungarian leadership. The author concludes that despite the eventual failure of the MFM its various efforts had to be made in order to demonstrate Hungary's commitment to Western European culture, independence, Hungarians living outside its borders, the defense of the Jewish population, and a Western-style of democracy.</p>"
The life of Guido Reni,"['Malvasia, Carlo Cesare , 1616-1693']","<p>The main source of what we know about Guido Reni is <em>The Life of Guido Reni</em> by Malvasia. It lets us see a major artist of the Italian Baroque through the eyes of his own age. The text contains considerable detail on what Guido painted, as well as his commissions and patrons. As Reni's close friend, Malvasia took much of his material from first-hand knowledge; documentary evidence from the artist's recently discovered account book attests to the reliability of his biographer's text.</p>
<p>But Malvasia's biography is far more than a chronicle of facts about Reni's art. Through a wealth of illustrative incidents based on eyewitness accounts we come to know Reni as an individual, driven by compulsions, beset by phobias, and isolated by pride. He appears as a man alone in a crowd, desperately anxious to defend his position as a major artist, enormously vulnerable to what were often imagined insults. We see him as an individual obsessed with sorcery and witchcraft and having an overwhelming compulsion for gambling that eventually brought about his ruin and hastened his death. No earlier biography provides so much material about an artist's inner life.</p>
<p>The editors have added a substantial introductory essay to their translation of Reni's biography along with an analysis of the text and a section on Malvasia and his writings. Malvasia wrote the best early guidebook to the paintings of Bologna, and his vast compendium on the Bolognese School of painters is the most important regional ""Lives of the Artists"" that appeared in Italy during the 17th century. As this is the first book on Reni in English, the editors have added a section intended as an introduction to his rather complex stylistic development. Eight illustrations are included to show some of Reni's most important works.</p>"
Educating For Careers: Policy Issues In A Time Of Change,['Thomas F. Powers'],"<p>The major questions of policy in matching the nation's educational system with its employment needs—during a period of rapid change for both—are explored here by eighteen authorities in public and private education, industry, organized labor, and government. Among the vital issues addressed are: the responsibilities of various educational agencies, career planning, the effects of the economic climate on career education, the use and misuse of certification and credentialism, the interface between general and career education, and the need for more ""generalizable"" education.</p>
<p>The book's ultimate objective is to explore how the fullest and best education for both work and non-work roles may be delivered in both traditional and nontraditional ways.</p>"
An Introduction To Number Theory (mit Press) (the Mit Press),['Harold M Stark'],"<p>The majority of students who take courses in number theory are mathematics majors who will not become number theorists. Many of them will, however, teach mathematics at the high school or junior college level, and this book is intended for those students learning to teach, In addition to a careful presentation of the standard material usually taught in a first course in elementary number theory, this book includes a chapter on quadratic fields which the author has designed to make students think about some of the ""obvious"" concepts they have taken for granted earlier. The book also includes a large number of exercises, many of which are nonstandard.</p>"
"Commuter Marriage: Living Together, Apart","['Winfield, Fairlee E.']","<p>The marine Eocene-Oligocene transition of 34 million years ago was a critical turning point in Earth's climatic history, when the warm, high-diversity ""greenhouse"" world of the early Eocene ceded to the glacial, ""icehouse"" conditions of the early Oligocene. This book surveys the advances in stratigraphic and paleontological research and isotopic analysis made since 1989 in regard to marine deposits around the world. In particular, it summarizes the high-resolution details of the so-called doubthouse interval (roughly 45 to 34 million years ago), which is critical to testing climatic and evolutionary hypotheses about the Eocene deterioration.</p>
<p>The authors' goals are to discuss the latest information concerning climatic and oceanographic change associated with this transition and to examine geographic and taxonomic patterns in biotic turnover that provide clues about where, when, and how fast these environmental changes happened. They address a range of topics, including the tectonic and paleogeographic setting of the Paleogene; specific issues related to the stratigraphy of shelf deposits; advances in recognizing and correlating boundary sections; trends in the expression of climate change; and patterns of faunal and floral turnover. In the process, they produce a valuable synthesis of patterns of change by latitude and environment.</p>"
Energy Developments In The Middle East,"['Cordesman, Anthony H.']","<p>The Middle Eastern and North African region (MENA) dominates world energy exports today and will likely do so for decades to come, even if world consumers make steady progress in conservation, renewable energy sources, and increases from gas, coal, and nuclear power. The MENA region, however, has been the scene of both internal crises and external conflicts. On several occasions, these crises have affected either the flow of MENA energy exports or the development of energy production and export capacity. The politics, economics, and social dynamics that shape threats to regional stability are complex. Cordesman details the factors behind these diverse forces and outlines current supply levels and future trends, taking each of these variables into consideration.</p>
<p>The MENA area includes at least 22 states, with a combined population of nearly 300 million, each with different political, economic, demographic, and security conditions and needs. It is divided into at least four sub-regions including the Maghreb (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia); the Levant and the Arab-Israeli confrontation states (Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria); the Gulf (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman); and the Red Sea states (Yemen, the Sudan, and Somalia). This important guide outlines the forces affecting each sub-region, including supply, demand, and financing, and forecasts the likely impact that different scenarios would have on energy resources under varying world conditions.</p>"
"In A Defiant Stance: The Conditions Of Law In Massachusetts Bay, The Irish Comparison; And The Coming Of The American Revolution","['Reid, John Phillip.']","<p>The minimum of violence accompanying the success of the American Revolution resulted in large part, argues this book, from the conditions of law the British allowed in the American colonies. By contrast, Ireland's struggle for independence was prolonged, bloody, and bitter largely because of the repressive conditions of law imposed by Britain.</p>
<p>Examining the most rebellious American colony, Massachusetts Bay, Professor Reid finds that law was locally controlled while imperial law was almost nonexistent as an influence on the daily lives of individuals. In Ireland the same English common law, because of imperial control of legal machinery, produced an opposite result. The Irish were forced to resort to secret, underground violence.</p>
<p>The author examines various Massachusetts Bay institutions to show the consequences of whig party control, in contrast to the situation in 18th-century Ireland. A general conclusion is that law, the conditions of positive law, and the matter of who controls the law may have more significant effects on the course of events than is generally assumed.</p>"
The Man Who Was Rip Van Winkle: Joseph Jefferson And Nineteenth-century American Theatre,['Benjamin Mcarthur'],"<p>The most beloved American comedic actor of the nineteenth century, Joseph Jefferson made his name as Washington Irving’s Rip Van Winkle. In this book, a compelling blend of biography and theatrical and cultural history, Benjamin McArthur chronicles Jefferson’s remarkable career and offers a lively and original account of the heroic age of the American theatre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe Jefferson’s entire life was spent on the stage, from the age of Jackson to the dawn of motion pictures. He extensively toured the United States&nbsp;as well as Australia and Great Britain. An ever-successful career (including acclaim as painter and memoirist) put him in the company of the great actors, artists, and writers of the day, including Edwin Forrest, Edwin Booth, John Singer Sargent, and William Dean Howells.&nbsp; This book rescues a brilliant figure and places him, appropriately enough, on center stage of a pivotal time for American theatre. McArthur explores the personalities of the period, the changing theatrical styles and their audiences, the touring life, and the wide and varied culture of theatre. Through the life of Jefferson, McArthur is able to illuminate an era.</p>"
Let History Judge: The Origins And Consequences Of Stalinism,['Roy Medvedev'],"<p>The most comprehensive and revealing investigation of Stalinism and political developments in the Soviet Union from 1922-1953, this edition is an extensively revised and expanded version of a classic work. Internationally known historian Roy Medvedev has included more than one-hundred new interviews, unpublished memoirs, and archives from survivors of Stalin's death camps. This updated version of a classic work was written during a time of great change in the Soviet Union. With the advent of <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost,</i> more progressive leadership has sought to demolish the Stalinist system which had finally crippled the Soviet Union and incited public discontent.</p>
<p><i>Let History Judge</i> contains new material on: purges in 1929-1931 and terror against the peasantry, the Kirov assasination and show trials, the ""great terror"" from 1936-1938 which caused irreparable damage to the Soviet Union and left it vulnerable for Hilter's attack in 1941, the trial of Bukharin, Trotsky's revolutionary activity and Stalin's involvement with his murder in Mexico, Stalin's miscalculations and errors during the war which cost the Soviet Union nearly 25 million in casualties, new purges from 1946-1953, and the actual vote of the Seventeenth Congress, which decided Stalin's candidacy.</p>
<p>Since the first edition was finished by the author in 1969 and published in 1971, dozens of new informants have come forward to give their evidence to Roy Medvedev. Distinguished Soviet literary, cultural, and political figures like the late Alexander Twardovsky, Ilja Ehrenburg, Konstantin Simonov, Yuri Trifono, Mikhail Romm and many others have accumulated documentary records of Stalinism inanticipation of an expanded version.</p>"

"Last Of The Cold War Spies: The Life Of Michael Straight, The Only American In Britain's Cambridge Spy Ring","['Perry, Roland , 1946-']","<p>The most damaging spy network of the Cold War—the infamous Cambridge Spy Ring—was comprised of several powerful and influential British citizens—and one American, Michael Straight. Born to a wealthy New England family, Straight attended Cambridge University in the 1930s, and there he fell in with the notorious circle of young men working for Soviet intelligence —Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, and Kim Philby, who was to become the most famous spy of the century.For the next several decades, Michael Straight led a secret life: While working at the State Department, he passed intelligence reports to a Russian agent; while running his family’s magazine, <i>The New Republic</i>, he funded several communist fronts; and while serving U.S. presidents, including John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, he continued to meet with agents around the world.Despite Michael Straight’s 1963 ""confession” to the FBI that his covert activity ceased in 1941, investigative journalist and author Roland Perry has unearthed a different story. Incorporating material from exclusive interviews with Michael Straight, members of his family, and former KGB agents (Perry has been careful to corroborate all KGB-supplied information), as well as archival research from the CIA, FBI, and Soviet intelligence, Perry presents a full and complete portrait of Michael Straight, the last of the Cold War spies.</p>"
Scoville: Mx - Perscription For Disast,['Herbert Scoville'],"<p>The MX missile system requires the placement of intercontinental ballistic missiles, each equipped with ten nuclear warheads, in constantly shifting patterns of underground deployment at sites that occupy vast tracts of land. This is a strategem for disaster, Herbert Scoville argues. ""The scale of the MX deployment program almost defies comprehension. It can only be described by using the superlative case--the most expensive, the most everything, except effective.<br>

In this book Scoville, President of the Arms Control Association and formerly a senior official in the Central Intelligence Agency, reveals the MX to be an unnecessary and extraordinarily expensive project that will not fufill its original intent. He points out that land-based missiles will still be vulnerable to attack and may actually increase the risk of such an attack, since the MX will lead to a new and accelerated arms race.<br>

"Aids And Intravenous Drug Use: The Influence Of Morality, Politics, Social Science, And Race In The Making Of A Tragedy",['M. Daniel Fernando'],"<p>The name AIDS is an accusation. It implies punishment for sin--homosexuality and promiscuity. AIDS is a moral judgement masquerading as a scientific name, which is at the very heart of discrimination against the infected. At the bottom are drug users, victims of the War On Drugs, condemned to contract AIDS by using contaminated syringes necessitated by scarcity resulting from restrictive policies. A rational way to control HIV is to liberalize drug paraphernalia policies as in Europe. The U.S. has not taken this simple step, thus unleashing the AIDS epidemic among drug users, their sexual partners, and neonates. While this policy neglect can be understood in the context of AIDS prevention dominated by moral, political, and religious ideologies rather than epidemiological facts, there are critical racial implications. The ethnic divide separating the white researchers and the infected who belong to minorities has fuelled comparisons of AIDS with the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study and some preventive strategies have been called genocidal plots. Recent research indicating the ineffectiveness of bleach to disinfect paraphernalia has exposed the deadly consequences of a nonchalant attitude to research and compromises for political expediency.</p>"
Elizabeth And Hazel: Two Women Of Little Rock,['David Margolick'],"<p>The names Elizabeth Eckford and Hazel Bryan Massery may not be well known, but the image of them from September 1957 surely is: a black high school girl, dressed in white, walking stoically in front of Little Rock Central High School, and a white girl standing directly behind her, face twisted in hate, screaming racial epithets. This famous photograph captures the full anguish of desegregation—in Little Rock and throughout the South—and an epic moment in the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>In this gripping book, David Margolick tells the remarkable story of two separate lives unexpectedly braided together. He explores how the haunting picture of Elizabeth and Hazel came to be taken, its significance in the wider world, and why, for the next half-century, neither woman has ever escaped from its long shadow. He recounts Elizabeth’s struggle to overcome the trauma of her hate-filled school experience, and Hazel’s long efforts to atone for a fateful, horrible mistake. The book follows the painful journey of the two as they progress from apology to forgiveness to reconciliation and, amazingly, to friendship. This friendship foundered, then collapsed—perhaps inevitably—over the same fissures and misunderstandings that continue to permeate American race relations more than half a century after the unforgettable photograph at Little Rock. And yet, as Margolick explains, a bond between Elizabeth and Hazel, silent but complex, endures.</p>"
"Mannerism And Renaissance Poetry: Concept, Mode, Inner Design",['James V. Mirollo'],"<p>The nature and significance of mannerism has been a topic of lively debate for centuries.&nbsp; This insightful book by James V. Mirollo provides not only an introduction to mannerism as a theoretical concept and a historical stylistic mode but also a cogent discussion of some of the literary and artistic manifestations of mannerism in the Renaissance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mirollo begins by offering an updated account of the controversy over mannerism that began in the mid-sixteenth century and is only now approaching a consensus.&nbsp; Both the survey and the bibliography that accompanies it are unusual in their range and interdisciplinary coverage, for they include selected literary, art, and music theory and criticism from Vasari to the present.&nbsp; The following chapters take up the aesthetic sensibility of mannerism as it revealed in Cellini’s <i>Vita</i> and in Italian and European Petrarchism, literary and visual.&nbsp; The essays on Petrarchism focus on the diverse ways in which painters and poets—Italian, French, Spanish, and English—treated the lyric conventions of the veiled face and the gloved hand.&nbsp; The postlude offers a brief exposition of the contrast between mannerism and both Renaissance and baroque styles, as evident in a group of English related pastoral poems.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"
Moral Reasoning For Journalists: Cases And Commentary,['Steven Knowlton'],"<p>The nature of journalism requires that an ethical decision be made at every stage. While many of these decisions lead to obvious choices, many present thorny problems; some questions may be so subtle that they are not even noticed consciously by the journalist. This up-to-date collection of more than two dozen real-life cases illustrates the moral issues facing contemporary American journalists. It will help students hone their reasoning skills, encouraging them to think rationally and act with integrity. The cases are presented in substantial detail to provide students with a realistic sense of the complexity of issues facing journalists today.</p>
<p>Knowlton, a veteran journalist and teacher, combines his experience of more than 30 years in the field with extensive interviews with dozens of today's top journalists, so that each case is presented with commentary and thought-provoking analysis. Discussion questions at the end of each case analysis probe the depth of the ethical concerns raised. This book can be used as a stand-alone text, as a supplemental casebook, or in conjunction with the companion anthology, <i>The Journalist's Moral Compass: Basic Principles</i> (Praeger, 1994).</p>"
Lessons From The Light,"['Ring', 'Kenneth']","<p>The near-death experience (NDE) is not only a revelation of the most profound and soul-shattering beauty, but, as research shows, it is something that has the power to drastically transform and improve the lives of those who survive this kind of encounter with death. Lessons from the Light: What We Can Learn from the Near-Death Experience is unlike other books on the NDE in that it is written not so much about these life-changing encounters as such but for persons who have never had an NDE themselves yet wish to learn from those who have. Lessons from the Light recounts not only many inspiring NDEs from persons of all ages (including very young children) and classes, but for the first time also discloses Dr. Ring's collection of cases where persons journey beyond the Light as well as the NDEs of blind persons. Such remarkable testimony is then used as a basis to provide helpful guidance and practical exercises in order for readers to live a life of greater self-insight, self-compassion, and concern for others, as well as to be better prepared for death, dying, and bereavement.</p>"
Assault On The Left,"['James K. Davis', 'Edwin Hoyt']","<p>The New Left was founded in 1962, and as a social and political protest movement, it captured the attention of the nation in the Sixties. By 1968, the New Left was marching in unison with hundreds of political action groups to achieve one goal-the end of the war in Vietnam. Under J. Edgar Hoover's direction, the FBI went from an intelligence collection agency during WWII, to an organization that tried to undermine protest movements like the New Left. Hoover viewed the New Left as a threat to the American way of life, so in an enormous effort of questionable legality, the FBI implemented some 285 counter-intelligence (COINTELPRO) actions against the New Left. The purpose of COINTELPRO was to infiltrate, disrupt, and otherwise neutralize the entire movement. In truth, the FBI intended to wage war on the antiwar movement.</p><p>In this real-life spy story-J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men, wiretaps, burglaries, misinformation campaigns, informants, and plants-Davis offers a glimpse into the endlessly fascinating world of the Sixties. Kent State, Columbia University, Vietnam Moratorium Day, the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the Cambodian invasion and March Against Death are all examined in this riveting account of the longest youth protest movement in American history. This is the only book devoted entirely to the New Left COINTELPRO, and the first one written after the declassification of more than 6,000 counterintelligence documents that reveal the true nature and extent of the FBI's <i>Assault on the Left</i>.</p>"
The Interracial Experience: Growing Up Black/white Racially Mixed In The United States,"['Brown, Ursula M.']","<p>The number of black-white mixed marriages increased by 504% in the last 25 years. By offering relevant demographic, research, and sociocultural data as well as a series of intensely personal and revealing vignettes, Dr. Brown investigates how mixed race people cope in a world that has shoehorned them into a racial category that denies half of their physiological and psychological existence. She also addresses their struggle for acceptance in the black and white world and the racist abuses many of them have suffered.</p>
<p>Brown interweaves research findings with interviews of children of black-white interracial unions to highlight certain psychosocial phenomenon or experiences. She looks at the history of interracial marriages in the United States and discusses the scientific and social theories that underlie the racial bigotry suffered by mixed people. Questions of racial identity, conflict, and self-esteem are treated as are issues of mental health. An important look at contemporary mixed race issues that will be of particular interest to scholars, researchers, students, and professionals dealing with race, family, and mental health concerns.</p>"
Preemie Parents: Recovering From Baby's Premature Birth,['Lisa Mcdermott-perez'],"<p>The number of premature births in the United States has risen dramatically in recent years, with premature birth now designated the #1 obstetrics problem in the United States - affecting some 12 percent of all births. In the midst of these births—where a mother's arms and joy are replaced by incubators and cautious hope— are the parents, whose strength and emotional stability may understandably wane in the face of the challenges and fears created with the birth. It is about and for the benefit of these parents that this helpful book was written.</p>
<p>Psychotherapist Lisa McDermott-Perez, joined in this work by several medical experts also offering insights, reveals the world of preemie parents and the emotional stresses they face before and after the birth. From feelings of guilt and anger over real and imagined mistakes, to depression, jealousy and fear, we learn how traumatic this time can be fbr mothers and fathers. This book takes us step-by-step to either recover as Preemie Parents or to help loved ones who are facing the situation. Appendices list resources and support networks, definitions of terms and equipment commonly used in neonatal medicine, and common medications and their potential side effects.</p>"
The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation,['Blake Stimson'],"<p>The old dream of social belonging and political sovereignty-the dream of nation-was fraught with anxiety and contradiction for many artists and intellectuals in the 1950s. On the one hand, memories of the Second World War remained vivid and the chauvinism that had enabled it threatened to return with the growing tensions of the Cold War. On the other hand, the need to bind together into a new global identity-into a world nation or family of man-seemed ever more pressing as a bulwark against the rapidly expanding threat of a nuclear World War III.The Pivot of the World looks at an exceptional effort to work out that geopolitical tension by cultural means as developed in three hugely ambitious photographic projects: The Family of Man exhibition that opened in 1955 and traveled the world for the next decade; Robert Frank's influential book The Americans,photographed in 1955-1956 and first published in 1958; and Bernd and Hilla Becher's typological record of industrial architecture, begun in 1957 and continuing today. Each of these projects worked to release the dream of nation-of belonging and sovereignty-from its old civic trappings through the medium of photography's serial form, in the experience of one photograph followed by another and another and another, so that all seem at once intimately connected and at the same time autonomous and distinct. Innovations in the serial composition of photographic form could open new possibilities for social form while the modern desire for political belonging could be made cosmopolitan, could be globalized-but in the most human of ways. This epic sense of purpose lasted only for a moment-it had already passed by the beginning of the 1960s-but it bears particular interest for any historical understanding of the contest over globalization that continues to hold such great consequence for us now.</p>"
The Metrosexual Guide To Style: A Handbook For The Modern Man,"['Flocker, Michael , 1963-']","<p>The old-fashioned, repressed, un-moisturized man has been banished to the hinterlands and a new breed is taking center stage.

Profits Before People?: Ethical Standards And The Marketing Of Prescription Drugs (bioethics And The Humanities),['Leonard J. Weber'],"<p>The pharmaceutical industry has come under intense criticism in recent years. One poll found that 70% of the sample agreed that drug companies put profits ahead of people. Is this perception accurate? Have drug companies traded ethics for profits and placed people at risk?</p>
<p>In Profits before People? Leonard J. Weber exposes pharmaceutical industry practices that have raised ethical concerns. Providing systematic ethical analysis and reflection, he discusses such practices as compensating physicians for serving as speakers or consultants, providing incentives to physicians to enroll patients as subjects in clinical research, and advertising prescription drugs to the public through the mass media. Weber’s critique of the industry is stern. While acknowledging that new industry guidelines are promising, he finds much room for improvement in the way drug companies market their products. Yet Weber makes a strong case that profits and ethics can coexist and that they are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>In an effort to understand the proper place of commerce in disseminating information about new drugs, the book aims to clarify basic responsibilities and to help identify sound ethical practices. It recognizes that ethics and law are not the same, that ""having a right"" is different from ""doing the right thing,"" and that taking ethics seriously means recognizing that the law does not answer all questions about what is right. Weber points the way to more demanding standards and better practices that might begin to restore confidence in the drug industry.</p>"
"Imagining The Holy Land: Maps, Models, And Fantasy Travels",['Burke O. Long'],"<p>The photographs, maps, travelers’ accounts, and physical reconstructions that are the subject of this book once fired the popular imagination with fantasies of a place called ""the Holy Land."" It was a singular space of religious imagining, multilayered and charged with symbolism. As Burke O. Long shows, there are many holy lands, and they have been visualized in many ways since the 19th century. At the Chautauqua Institute in New York, visitors could walk down Palestine Avenue to ""Palestine"" and a model of Jerusalem, or along North Avenue to a scale model of the ""Jewish Tabernacle."" At the St. Louis World’s Fair of 1904, a replica of Ottoman Jerusalem covered 11 acres, while 300 miles to the southeast a seven-story-high Christ of the Ozarks stood above a modern re-creation of the Holy Land set in the Arkansas hills. For home viewing, there were tours of the Holy Land via stereoscopic photographs, books such as Picturesque Palestine, and numerous accounts by travelers whose visions of the Holy Land shaped and were shaped by American forms of Christianity and Judaism.</p>"

Deficit Hysteria: A Common Sense Look at America's Rush to Balance the Budget,['Arthur Benavie'],"<p>The political consensus in the United States today is that the nation avoid deficit spending. But as virtuous and unassailable as that goal sounds, it has fallacies and dangers. In a lucid, nontechnical writing style, Benavie shows that deficits can be either good or bad and explains how to tell the difference. Deficits, or government borrowing, can be beneficial or harmful depending on what the government does with the money. Preventing such borrowing, Benavie points out, would be comparable to preventing one's family from borrowing money to buy a house or to put a child through college.</p><p>Deficits can be beneficial to the nation's economic health in three main ways. When the economy slumps, a deficit, which is automatically created, helps to reduce the severity of the recession. When the economy is seriously depressed, boosting the deficit may be the only cure. Finally, deficits to support such investments as basic research, cleaning up toxic waste, and rebuilding inner cities are crucial to the economic health of future generations.</p>"

Bishop Of Everywhere: Bernard Shaw And The Life Force,"['Smith, Warren Sylvester , 1912-1984']","<p>The Prologue presents three aspects of Shaw's personality as they are revealed in <em>John Bull's Other Island</em>: the self-aggrandizing politician (Broadbent), the ironist-satirist (Larry Doyle), and the religious seeker (Peter Keegan). It is the ""Keegan-Shaw"" that is the principal subject of the book.</p>
<p>Part I reviews the birth and development of the Life Force idea as an alternative to ""valueless agnosticism"" in Shaw's struggle against cynicism, the conventional response to World War I. Shaw's unpublished lecture notes of 1906 on Darwin and Darwinism are related to his <em>Methuselah</em> Preface of 1921. Part II explicates the ""life force"" concept of evolution by comparing it with that of Neo-Darwinians (Julian Huxley), and that of the scientific theologian, Teilhard de Chardin. For Shaw ""the central challenge to Darwinism is not so much how evolution happens, as why it happens"" - a challenge confronted today by an increasing number of both scientists and theologians. Part III explains Shaw's difficulty in reconciling the ""life force"" idea with the reality of the modern world, especially with political irresponsibility and ineptitude. A brief ""Envoy"" evaluates the significance of the ""life force"" for our times and for the future. The ""life force"" was the central article of faith for Shaw the salvationist prophet—albeit a prophet armed with wit, a ""laughing prophet.""</p>"

The Business Of Healthcare [3 Volumes] (praeger Perspectives) (v. 1-3),['Editor-kenneth H. Cohn; Editor-douglas E. Hough'],"<p>The rapid pace of change in the healthcare industry is creating turbulence for just about everyone. For consumers, affordable access to quality healthcare is an issue of primary importance. For employers, health benefits have grown to be an alarmingly large component of their compensation packages. For physicians and other healthcare providers, practice management has become increasingly demanding. Each of this set's three volumes untangles the complexity, provides answers to knotty questions, and points the way toward better healthcare for all. Features include commentary, prescriptions, and insights from leaders in the healthcare industry, including physicians, attorneys, administrators, educators, and business consultants. The result: a landmark set filled with provocative analysis and practical recommendations destined to improve the delivery of healthcare.</p>
<p>The rapid pace of change in the healthcare industry is creating turbulence for just about everyone. For consumers, affordable access to quality healthcare is an issue of primary importance. For employers, health benefits have grown to be an alarmingly large component of their compensation packages. For physicians and other healthcare providers, practice management has become increasingly demanding. Complexity is the rule, thanks to government regulations and insurer requirements, the expansion of technology in everything from diagnosis to records, and the desire of policymakers and others to have a say in how healthcare is delivered and to whom. <i>The Business of Healthcare</i> provides Rx to these and other challenges in three volumes: <i>Volume 1: Practice Management Volume 2: Leading Healthcare Organizations Volume 3: Improving Systems of Care</i>. Each volume features commentary and insights from leaders in the healthcare industry, including physicians, attorneys, administrators, educators, and business consultants. The result: a landmark set filled with provocative analysis and practical recommendations destined to improve the delivery of healthcare.</p>
<p><i>The Business of Healthcare</i> presents ideas and information that until now have been sequestered in a variety of professional journals and books, in isolation from each other. For the first time, healthcare professionals, consumers, scholars, students, and policymakers alike will have access to the same body of information about a critical sector of the economy-one that represents 15 percent of the U.S. national GDP, consumes 10 percent of federal government spending, and employs twelve million people. This three-volume set will address the current debates that are determining the future course of the industry. <i>Volume 1: Practice Management</i>: Physicians are beginning to realize that, in addition to providing health care, they are owners and managers of multi-million dollar enterprises. Unfortunately, most have not received formal training in the skills needed to operate such a business. In this volume, experts will present practical advice for physicians (as well as their practice managers and staff) to improve operations. Topics include: *The opportunities and challenges of solo practice. *The logistics of joining and leaving a physician practice. *Performance management in physician practices. *Creating a culture of accountability in physician practices. *Managing difficult and disruptive physicians. *Developing and promoting a physician practice. *Internet marketing of physician practices. *The potential benefits and implementation roadblocks of pay for performance. *Accounts receivable management in hospital and physician practices. *The future of the physician practice. <i>Volume 2: Leading Healthcare Organizations</i>: Whether running their own practice or working as a part of a larger organization, health professionals are being called upon to provide leadership—something more important than ever in health care, where some sectors of the industry are in turmoil, while others are being transformed entirely. This volume will offer insights into the changing role of leadership throughout an organization, and describe how health professionals can exert their influence to effect positive change. Topics covered include: *Perspectives on leading complex healthcare delivery systems. *Mending the gap between practicing physicians and hospital executives. *The physician's role on the hospital board, and a blueprint for success. *The impact of biotechnology advances on healthcare delivery. *The impact of informatics on healthcare delivery. *The next frontier in addressing clinical hospital supply costs. *Liability risk management: Saving money and relationships. *Pastoral medicine: The impact of pastoral care. *The role of complementary and alternative medicine in healthcare today. <i>Volume 3: Improving Systems of Care</i> : This volume explores the current state of health care, and it describes the critical issues that must be resolved in the short run and the long run to ensure that the industry provides the value that the public both demands and deserves. Topics include: *Quality in healthcare: concepts and practice. *Adapting proven aviation safety tools to healthcare: Improving healthcare by changing the safety culture. *Introduction to healthcare information technology. *Market dynamics and financing strategies in the development of medical technologies. *An innovative service delivery model for specialized care. *The impact of healthcare on the US economy. *Improving systems of care: a patient's perspective. *The cost of end-of-life care. *Building the bridge between business and medicine. Better, more efficient healthcare is not just possible but needed more than ever. <i>The Business of Health Care</i> will help lead the way toward a healthier, happier society.</p>"
"The West European Allies, The Third World, And U.s. Foreign Policy: Post-cold War Challenges (contributions In Political Science)",['Richard Payne'],"<p>The recent and ongoing crises in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Central America, and southern Africa have been and continue to be approached in very different ways by the United States and its West European allies. Richard J. Payne shows how the many future challenges to the strategic alliance of the U.S. and the NATO countries will have to be adapted to a new and less confrontational world, emphasizing the international economic situation over political or ideological factors. Payne maintains that despite years of divergent views on how to handle Third World trouble spots, strains within the Western Alliance can be alleviated in the future by diplomatic and cooperative means.</p>
<p>This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the underlying tensions, and cooperation, between the United States and Western Europe in their approaches to the Soviet Union, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Iran-Iraq War and IraQ's invasion of Kuwait, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, and the struggle for ideological and political control of southwestern Africa. American and European strategies and interests in the Third World greatly affected the broader issues of detente, Eastern-Western European relations, America's leadership abilities, and ultimately NATO itself. The lessening of ideological confrontations between Moscow and Washington, Payne affirms, was followed by the revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe. This volume will be used in courses on international relations, American foreign policy, world politics, Third World politics, global issues, and West European politics. It will also be of great value to political scientists and policymakers.</p>"
American Indians and U.S. Politics: A Companion Reader,['John Meyer'],"<p>The relationship between American Indians and the U.S. political system is both vitally important and unique. Yet American Indians-as individuals and as tribal nations-typically receive scant attention in introductory courses on American government and politics. This is the only reader on Native America and U.S. politics designed to be incorporated into introductory government courses. It will help students to obtain a clearer understanding of such contemporary issues as Indian fishing rights and gaming casinos and to see topics central to the course-the Constitution, the structure of federalism, citizenship, and civil liberties-from the perspective of groups that have often sought a protected place <i>outside</i> the U.S. polity rather than inclusion within.</p><p>Enabling students to compare the American Indian experience with the ideas presented in other course materials, the readings in this book are keyed to the topics most commonly found in the course syllabi. Selected for their insight and accessibility as well as diversity of viewpoints and topics, the essays provide a unique insight into the character of the American political system from the perspective of American Indians, teaching the reader much about both the tribes and the character of politics and government in the U.S. generally.</p>"
Environmental Impacts Of Globalization And Trade: A Systems Study,"['Lofdahl, Corey L.']","<p>The relationship between trade and the environment has become an increasingly contentious issue between economists and environmentalists. Economists maintain that trade helps the natural environment because rich countries can better afford to protect their unspoiled areas.</p>
<p>Environmentalists counter that the pursuit of national wealth drives global environmental degradation and that free trade accelerates the process.Instead of arguing one side or the other,this book uses new analytic methods, including a systems dynamics model, to seek an answer to the impasse. Using lateral pressure theory to account for politics within and among nations, it extends the theory's initial application (which was to explain the onset of war) to the environment by specifying additional connections between the natural and social spheres. In making explicit the complex causal connections between world trade and environmental degradation, the book finds that GNP increases in the rich, developed countries are linked to deforestation in the poorer, developing countries. It also uses insights derived from this finding to critique current trade policy prescriptions.</p>"
"The Things We Do: Using the Lessons of Bernard and Darwin to Understand the What, How, and Why of Our Behavior",['Gary Cziko'],"<p>The remarkable achievements that modern science has made in physics, chemistry,biology, medicine, and engineering contrast sharply with our limited knowledge of the human mind and behavior. A major reason for this slow progress, claims Gary Cziko, is that with few exceptions,behavioral and cognitive scientists continue to apply a Newtonian-inspired view of animate behavior as an organism's output determined by environmental input. This one-way cause-effect approach ignores the important findings of two major nineteenth-century biologists, French physiologist Claude Bernard and English naturalist Charles Darwin.Approaching living organisms as purposeful systems that behave in order to control their perceptions of the external environment provides a new perspective for understanding what, why, and how living things, including humans, do what they do.</p><p>Cziko examines in particular perceptual control theory, which has its roots in Bernard's work on the self-regulating nature of living organisms and in the work of engineers who developed the field of cybernetics during and after World War II. He also shows how our evolutionary past together with Darwinian processes currently occurring within our bodies, such as the evolution of new brain connections, provide insights into the immediate and ultimate causes of behavior.Writing in an accessible style, Cziko shows how the lessons of Bernard and Darwin, updated with the best of current scientific knowledge, can provide solutions to certain long-standing theoretical and practical problems in behavioral science and enable us to develop new methods and topics for research.</p>"
When Consumers Complain,['Arthur Best'],"<p>The Renaissance and the age of discovery introduced Europeans to exotic cultures, mores, manners, and ideas.

Aging with Attitude: Growing Older with Dignity and Vitality,['Robert Arthur Levine M.D.'],"<p>The Rolling Stones (now in their 60s) have sung to us for years about what a drag it is getting old, but it doesn't have to be that way. Despite living in a youth-oriented society, many of the aged patients seen by Dr. Levine have kept their emotional zest, intellectual zeal, and empowering dignity. Levine points out well-known public figures who are clearly aging with dignity and vitality. The neurologist author shows steps we can take to age while retaining these qualities, defying a society that challenges this quest. Living longer is not enough for most of us: we don't want to just survive. The quality of our life as we age is most important, and much of that depends on our attitudes and approach. The text includes strategies to optimize self-esteem as well as health, including attention to nurtrition, exercise, health care, education and mind stimulation, sexuality, social activities, and cosmetics and cosmetic surgery.</p><p>Readers are shown the physiological facts of aging, from cellular to systemic changes. The most common diseases in old age are described, and actions are suggested to avoid many of the diseases. Levine also explores how the disorders change abilities and self-perception.</p>"

"Sikhs History, Religion, and Society",['W. H. McLeod'],"<p>The Sikhs, a colorful and controversial people about whom little is generally known, have been the subject of much hypothetical speculation. Their non-conformist behavior, except to their own traditions, and their fierce independence, even to demanding autonomy, have recently attracted world-wide attention. Hew McLeod, internationally known scholar of Sikh studies, provides a just and accurate description in his introducion to this religious community from northern India now numbering about sixteen million people, exploring their history, doctrine, and literature.</p><p><i>The Sikhs</i> begins by giving an overview of the people's history, then covers the origins of the Sikh tradition, dwelling on controversies surrounding the life and doctrine of the first Master, Guru Nanak (1469-1539). The book surveys the subsequent life of the community with emphasis on the founding of the Khalsa, the order that gives to Sikhs the insignia by which they are best known. The remaining sections concern Sikh doctrine, the problem of who should be regarded as a Sikh, and a survey of Sikh literature. Finally, the book considers the present life of the community - its dispersion around the world to Asia, Australasia, North America, Africa, and Europe, and its involvement in the current trials of the Punjab.</p><p>Sikh culture is believed to have been settled and unchanging from the time of the Gurus onwards. <i>The Sikhs</i>, a major new work by a leading authority, reveals that this is a very misleading view. McLeod treats a variety of questions sympathetically and in so doing he establishes a new understanding for students of religion and for all those interested in current events inIndia.</p>"
Petroleum Politics And The Texas Railroad Commission (elma Dill Russell Spencer Foundation Series),['David F. Prindle'],"<p>The single most important domestic source of oil and gas is managed by the Texas Railroad Commission. As a result, the Commission has for decades exerted a profound influence on United States and world energy policy. This influence may even increase with the recent decision to remove price controls on oil and gas. Commission decisions determine where and when oil and gas wells are drilled, how much can be produced from them, and how the products can be transported. Since the 1930s the Commission has heavily influenced both the supply and the price of petroleum in the rest of the country simply because Texas provides such a large proportion of the United States' petroleum.</p>
<p>As might be expected with the management of resources worth billions of dollars, the Railroad Commission has been an arena of intense political maneuvering. David Prindle examines in detail seven policymaking episodes, covering five decades of the Commission's history. He recounts the economic and political cleavages arising from clashes of interest, the efforts of individuals and organizations to exert influence, the motives and methods underlying the policy choices of the Commissioners, and the political and economic consequences of those choices, both for Texas and for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>This detailed look at the Railroad Commission and the politics of petroleum in Texas will be of interest to the general public and all those involved in the oil and gas industry. Scholars and students in the field of policy studies, especially energy policy, will find this book to be an invaluable guide to an important sector of the American petroleum industry.</p>"
Diary Of A Dirty Little War: The Spanish-american War Of 1898,['Harvey Rosenfeld'],"<p>The Spanish-American War has been called a splendid little war, but, as Rosenfeld contends, it was a dirty little war as well. This colorful account, presented in diary format from the days preceding the declaration of war to the signing of the peace treaty with Spain, reveals how every aspect of American life was ultimately touched by the war. From the beginning, a unique spirit of patriotism pervaded the nation as volunteers flooded local enlistment centers. But it soon was evident that the United States was ill prepared to deal with the demands of training new troops, transporting them to staging areas, and protecting them against disease. Rosenfeld provides readers with the local color of the home front, including the experiences of the Jewish and black communities in the war, and strikes a balance between scholarly and popular writing.</p>
<p>Dramatic accounts of the battle of Manila and the heroism of Admiral Dewey, as well as extensive reports of land battles—including the efforts of Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders—fill the early daily entries. Loved ones eagerly awaited any news of military developments, and weary survivors detailed their ordeals in press accounts. Rosenfeld includes valuable contextual information on the Hawaiian annexation debate and the Puerto Rican expedition. This fascinating approach to an early American foray into international affairs brings to life a war that is often overlooked.</p>"

Foreshadows Of The Law: Supreme Court Dissents And Constitutional Development,['Donald E. Lively'],"<p>The Supreme Court has final authority in determining what the Constitution means. The Court's findings have not, however, always been final. Lively focuses on several landmark dissenting opinions--resisted initially--later redefining the meaning of the Constitution. Each opinion arises from a rich historical context and involves constitutional issues of pointed significance. Vivid descriptions of some of the colorful personalities behind the opinions add appeal. Lively conveys the evolutionary and dynamic nature of the law demonstrating the relationship between present and past understanding of the Constitution. He describes the competitive nature of constitutional development and identifies the relevance of factors including subjective preference, values, vying theories, and ideologies.</p>
<p>The role of the Court, is addressed as are the federal government's relationship to the states and their citizens; slavery; property rights; substantive due process; freedom of speech; and the right to be left alone. This is a clearly presented and highly instructive consideration of how the Constitution's interpretation has been fashioned over time with important insights relevant to today's Court and contemporary cases.</p>"

Investment Intelligence From Insider Trading (the Mit Press),"['Seyhun', 'H. Nejat']","<p>The term insider trading refers to the stock transactions of the officers, directors,and large shareholders of a firm. Many investors believe that corporate insiders, informed about their firms' prospects, buy and sell their own firm's stock at favorable times, reaping significant profits. Given the extra costs and risks of an active trading strategy, the key question for stock market investors is whether the publicly available insider-trading information can help them to outperform a simple passive index fund.Basing his insights on an exhaustive data set that captures information on all reported insider trading in all publicly held firms over the past twenty-one years—over one million transactions!—H. Nejat Seyhun shows how investors can use insider information to their advantage. He documents the magnitude and duration of the stock price movements following insider trading, determinants of insiders' profits, and the risks associated with imitating insider trading. He looks at the likely performance of individual firms and of the overall stock market, and compares the value of what one can learn from insider trading with commonly used measures of value such as price-earnings ratio, book-to-market ratio, and dividend yield.</p>"

Set on the stage, in the studio, and in great cities and small towns around the world, this richly textured narrative explores how the music is made in America today.</p>"
The Ancient Future Of The Itza: The Book Of Chilam Balam Of Tizimin (texas Pan American Series),"['Edmonson', 'Munro S.', 'Ed']","<p>The title of Edmonson's work refers to the Mayan custom of first predicting their history and then living it, and it may be that no other peoples have ever gone so far in this direction. <cite>The Book of Chilam Balam</cite> was a sacred text prepared by generations of Mayan priests to record the past and to predict the future. The official prophet of each twenty-year rule was the Chilam Balam, or Spokesman of the Jaguar--the Jaguar being the supreme authority charged with converting the prophet's words into fact.</p>
<p>This is a literal but poetic translation of one of fourteen known manuscripts in Yucatecan Maya on ritual and history. It pictures a world of all but incredible numerological order, slowly yielding to Christianity and Spanish political pressure but never surrendering. In fact, it demonstrates the surprising truth of a secret Mayan government during the Spanish rule, which continued to collect tribute in the names of the ruined Classic cities and preserved the essence of the Mayan calendar as a legacy for the tradition's modern inheritors.</p>
<p>The history of the Yucatecan Maya from the seventh to the nineteenth century is revealed. And this is history as the Maya saw it--of a people concerned with lords and priests, with the cosmology which justified their rule, and with the civil war which they perceived as the real dimension of the colonial period.</p>
<p>A work of both history and literature, the <cite>Tizimin</cite> presents a great deal of Mayan thought, some of which has been suspected but not previously documented. Edmonson's skillful reordering of the text not only makes perfect historical sense but also resolves the long-standing problem of correlating the two colonial Mayan calendars. The book includes both interpretative and literal translations, as well as the Maya parallel couplets and extensive annotations on each page. The beauty of the sacred text is illuminated by the literal translation, while both versions unveil the magnificent historical, philosophical, and social traditions of the most sophisticated native culture in the New World.</p>
<p>The prophetic history of the <cite>Tizimin</cite> creates a portrait of the continuity and vitality, of the ancient past and the foreordained future of the Maya.</p>"
The Receding Shadow Of The Prophet: The Rise And Fall Of Radical Political Islam,"['Takeyh, Ray', 'Gvosdev, Nikolas K.']","<p>The tragic events of September 11, 2001, in the United States renewed fears of an Islamist wave destabilizing the countries of the Muslim world. Yet the alarm raised over a previous wave of Islamism in the early 1990s, which threatened to overwhelm Egypt and Algeria and spill into the Balkans and Central Asia, proved to be unfounded. Takeyh and Gvosdev assert that while Islamism has been successful as an oppositional ideology of wrath, it has failed to provide Islamic societies with any feasible alternative to undertaking fundamental political and economic reforms. By detailing the defeat of Islamist movements in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Central Asia over the last decade, this book encourages us not to overestimate the Islamist threat in the current climate and the years to come.</p>
<p>Radical Islamists have been successful in mobilizing opposition to corrupt regimes, yet they have failed to translate their utopian vision into reality. Furthermore, their emphasis on violence alienates and frightens the middle class and other potential allies. Iran's revolution failed to create a model Islamic republic, and its government is increasingly losing legitimacy to demands for genuine democracy. Islamist governments in Afghanistan and Sudan relied upon violence to remain in power and ultimately collapsed. Islamist movements proved unable to dislodge the existing regimes in Egypt and Algeria. In the Balkans and Central Asia, Islamism has had little attraction for Western-oriented populations. Indeed, throughout the entire Islamic world, former radicals are seeking a new accommodation between Islamic values and liberal democracy. Takeyh and Gvosdev succinctly and accessibly explore the rise of radical Islam, as well as its ultimate demise in various nations.</p>"
Should The United States Privatize Social Security?,"['Aaron, Henry J.']","<p>The two papers that make up the core of this book address what is perhaps the most fundamental question in the current debate over Social Security: whether to shift, in part or even entirely, from today's pay-as-you-go system to one that is not just funded but also privatized in the sense that individuals would retain control over the investment of their funds and, therefore,personally bear the associated risk. John Shoven argues yes, Henry Aaron no. Theoretical issues such as the likely effects on saving behavior and capital formation figure importantly in this discussion. But so do a broad array of practical considerations such as the expense of fund management and accounting, questions about how the public would regard the fairness of any new system, and the impact of recent developments in the federal budget and the U.S. stock market.The book also includes responses to both papers by four prominent economists—Robert J. Barro and David M. Cutler, of Harvard University; Alicia H. Munnell, of Boston College; and James Tobin, of Yale University—as well as Henry Aaron's and John Shoven's replies. The introductory remarks are by Benjamin M. Friedman.</p>"
Peace And War: The Arab-israeli Military Balance Enters The 21st Century,['Anthony H. Cordesman'],"<p>The uncertain Arab-Israeli peace process has scarcely put an end to the threat of war in the Middle East. Israel's relations with its Arab neighbors remain tense, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a problem for the entire region, and the Israeli-Palestinian fighting that began in September 2000 shows that the peace process can suddenly become a war process. Renowned Middle East military expert Anthony Cordesman provides up-to-the-minute analysis in this richly detailed guide to one of the most complicated, and dangerous, regions in the world.</p>
<p>Cordesman covers every significant aspect of military and strategic issues in the region, including conventional forces, arms transfers, force quality and morale, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the dynamics of specific ongoing conflicts, and the outcome of possible future conflicts. He carefully weighs the political factors against what is known about actual military capabilities to shed light on the range of strategic options likely to be considered by each of the major regional actors, including Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the Palestinian Authority. He finds no easy answers, concluding that while the balance of conventional forces has stabilized significantly in recent years, the risks from unconventional warfare have escalated considerably and that any major new peace agreement is likely to unleash a whole new set of military concerns that have the potential to disrupt diplomatic agreements. Always mindful of the complexities of the region, <i>Peace and War</i> is the definitive guide to strategic developments in this vital part of the world.</p>"
Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story Of George Bent - Caught Between The Worlds Of The Indian And The White Man,"['David Fridtjof Halaas', 'Andrew E. Masich']","<p>The uncommon life of George Bent-""halfbreed""-spanned one of the most eventful epochs in American history. Caught uneasily between two cultures in constant conflict, it is a life mirrored in the fictional character Jack Crabb in Thomas Berger's classic novel Little Big Man.Born in 1843 to the prominent white trader Colonel William Bent and his Indian wife, Owl Woman, George Bent was raised as a Cheyenne. After receiving an education in white schools, Bent fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War and went on to become a Cheyenne warrior. He survived the horrific 1864 Sand Creek Massacre-and then fought for revenge with the ferocious Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. Bent later served as a prominent interpreter and negotiator for whites and an adviser to tribal leaders. He rode side-by-side with the great Indian leaders Red Cloud, Tall Bull, and Roman Nose, and he hobnobbed with frontier legends Kit Carson, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and George Custer.Toward the end of his life, George Bent felt a passionate need to set the historical record straight and preserve the memory of the Cheyenne Indians as a free people. The greatest historians and ethnologists of the day sought him out to hear and read his stories of the Cheyennes. George Bird Grinnell, George E. Hyde, James Mooney-all agreed that what they knew of nineteenth-century Cheyenne life came largely from George Bent.As a mixed blood, Bent lived between two worlds right up until the time of his death in 1918-never entirely fitting into either world, always on the fringes of both. His story is compelling human drama: action, love, tragedy, war, all unfolding against the epic backdrop of the Civil War and America's westward expansion.</p>"
Population Politics,['Virginia D. Abernethy'],"<p>The United Nations has stated that the 1990s are the last possible decade for regulating fertility rates so that populations do not grow beyond the earth's capacity to sustain human life. Demographic experts are confounded by the persistence of high fertility in light of a number of circumstances that were expected to cause a decline, such as international dissemination of technical assistance and capital; improved health care conditions to lower the risk of infant mortality; increased opportunities to develop literacy in men and women; the democratization of governments; and several decades of liberal immigration and refugee policies favoring third-world nations. Population Politics brilliantly dissects the paradigm responsible for the counterproductive efforts of nations and international agencies. Virginia D. Abernethy, Ph.D., a renowned anthropologist, shows why support offered in the name of a ""demographic transition"" has been misdirected; why policies which do not encourage caution and restraint hamper the shift to lower fertility. Ireland, Indonesia, Cuba, China, Turkey, and Egypt are a few of the countries to which Dr. Abernethy looks, showing how economic, sociocultural, and agricultural factors have been both a cause of population growth and a way-of attempting to stabilize population size. The author stresses that motivation is the key to birth control and, using historical and cross-cultural data, hypothesizes that perception of limited resources is the chief stimulus. Renewed interest in limiting family size is seen in third-world countries, such as Sudan and Burma, where traditional patterns of delaying first births and increasing the interval between having one child and the next are reviving. Dr Abernethy proceeds with a fascinating critical perspective on population growth in the United States, relating it to twentieth-century industrialization, urbanization, fluctuations in the economy, and an ""open door"" immigration policy.

"Dealing With Dictators: Dilemmas Of Us Diplomacy And Intelligence Analysis, 1945-1990 (belfer Center Studies In International Security)","['May, Ernest R.', 'Zelikow, Philip', 'Lundberg, Kirsten.', 'Johnson, Robert David']","<p>The United States continues to proclaim its support for democracy and its opposition to tyranny, but American presidents often have supported dictators who have allied themselves with the United States. This book illustrates the chronic dilemmas inherent in US dealings with dictators under conditions of uncertainty and moral ambiguity.Dealing with Dictators offers in-depth analysis of six cases: the United States and China, 1945-1948; UN intervention in the Congo, 1960-1965; the overthrow of the Shah of Iran; US relations with the Somoza regime in Nicaragua; the fall of Marcos in the Philippines; and US policy toward Iraq, 1988-1990. The authors' fascinating and revealing accounts shed new light on critical episodes in US foreign policy and provide a basis for understanding the dilemmas that US decision makers confronted. The chapters do not focus on whether US leaders made the ""right"" or ""wrong"" decisions, but instead seek to deepen our understanding of how uncertainty permeated the process and whether decision makers and their aides asked the right questions. This approach makes the book invaluable to scholars and students of government and history, and to readers interested in the general subject of how intelligence analysis interacts with policymaking.</p>"
A Graceful Exit: Life And Death On Your Own Terms,"['Basta, L. (lofty)']","<p>The United States spends an inordinate amount of time and resources on medical care for people near the end of their lives; yet, Americans do not live significantly longer than citizens of other Western countries. What are the motivations of this death-denying culture? How can we deal with the complexities of medical care as life unavoidably comes to a close? How can we resolve the controversies that complicate medical decisions in the presence of advanced age or end-stage disease? A Graceful Exit: Life and Death on Your Own Terms addresses the difficult issue inherent to an aging society - the right to control one's death. Many Americans are executing living wills to be spared the indignities of futile medical treatment. Current living wills, however, have proven to be nearly useless in guiding care. Dr. Lofty Basta, a renowned physician specializing in cardiology, frankly explains that most patients of advanced age or disease are incompetent to make health care decisions, or incapable of evaluating treatment options. This book provides examples of living wills that are clear, valid, and applicable to many medical situations, and is supported by intimate case histories that illustrate various problems. As a sidebar, the author relates how different Western countries are dealing with this controversial issue. A Graceful Exit is a provocative resource to the medical community, hospital administrators or members of ethics committees, politicians, the clergy, civic leaders, and all who wish to control their medical treatment near the end of life.</p>

Alzheimer,"['Konrad Maurer', 'Ulrike Maurer']","<p>The very name Alzheimer is sure to bring a shudder. Thirty to forty million people are now afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder that strips its victims of their identity and leaves families bereft and social services strained. Despite considerable research, the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease remain shrouded in mystery. So, too, does the man after whom it was named. Alois Alzheimer (1864--1915) was practicing medicine at the Frankfurt Asylum in 1901 when he met a patient, who would become known as ""Auguste D.,"" whose condition perplexed and intrigued him. <i>Alzheimer</i> is more than a biography; it is a story of scientific discovery at a crucial stage in the history of medical psychiatry.</p>

Filling the ranks,"['Williams', 'Cindy']","<p>The war in Iraq and the problematic military occupation of that country have called into question the adequacy of America's all-volunteer force. Politicians and others have expressed doubts about its equity and capability; some have called for the reinstatement of the draft. Yet over the past twenty years the all-volunteer military has become a technologically advanced force that has contributed to America's overall military advantage. This book analyzes current military pay and personnel policies and identifies changes needed to maintain and improve America's all-volunteer force.Filling the Ranks argues that to attract qualified and motivated volunteers, the armed forces need to offer better tangible inducements - pay, benefits, and training - to accompany such intangible rewards as pride in serving one's country. Many of the policies related to tangible rewards were established shortly after World War II and are no longer effective. Filling the Ranks presents detailed assessments of US military pay and personnel policies in light of the strategic, demographic, economic, and labor realities of the future. It identifies specific problems that today's military career patterns, training, pay, and benefits pose for officers and enlisted men and women in both active duty and reserve forces, discussing such issues as competition with the private sector for talent, the need to restructure compensation, and provision of family support. It offers recommendations for more flexible, adaptive, and effective policies and a blueprint for achieving them.</p>"
American Pests: The Losing War On Insects From Colonial Times To Ddt,"['Mcwilliams, James E.']","<p>The world of insects is one we only dimly understand. Yet from using arsenic, cobalt, and quicksilver to kill household infiltrators to employing the sophisticated tools of the Orkin Man, Americans have fought to eradicate the ""bugs"" they have learned to hate.</p>
<p>Inspired by the still-revolutionary theories of Rachel Carson's <i>Silent Spring</i>, James E. McWilliams argues for a more harmonious and rational approach to our relationship with insects, one that does not harm our environment and, consequently, ourselves along the way. Beginning with the early techniques of colonial farmers and ending with the modern use of chemical insecticides, McWilliams deftly shows how America's war on insects mirrors its continual struggle with nature, economic development, technology, and federal regulation. He reveals a very American paradox: the men and women who settled and developed this country sought to control the environment and achieve certain economic goals; yet their methods of agricultural expansion undermined their efforts and linked them even closer to the inexorable realities of the insect world.</p>
<p>As told from the perspective of the often flamboyant actors in the battle against insects, <i>American Pests</i> is a fascinating investigation into the attitudes, policies, and practices that continue to influence our behavior toward insects. Asking us to question, if not abandon, our reckless (and sometimes futile) attempts at insect control, McWilliams convincingly argues that insects, like people, have an inherent right to exist and that in our attempt to rid ourselves of insects, we compromise the balance of nature.</p>"

The Quest For Identity: From Minority Groups To Generation Xers,['Donald M. Taylor'],"<p>There are groups in society that experience profound social problems. Others betray a growing social malaise. Massive academic underachievement, family dysfunction, substance misuse, violence, and delinquent behavior are some of the major crises afflicting groups in the United States and Canada, including Aboriginal people, African Americans, and certain Hispanic groups.^LTaylor adds to this list the escalating number of so-called street kids roaming inner-city streets. To a lesser but no less frightening extent, he includes what has traditionally symbolized society's most privileged group-young white men. He asserts that while these are not the only groups who stand out as noticeably disadvantaged, they are among the most visible and, due to his research and activities, allow him to test his arguments and offer his proposals for change.</p>
<p>Drawing upon his research experience in Canada, the United States, South Africa, and Indonesia, Taylor examines the impact of assimilation and the policies of cultural diversity and multiculturalism on these groups. He offers surprising insights into the causes of group malaise and individual failure, and his conclusions are bound to be of significant interest to scholars, students, and researchers involved with intergroup dynamics and cultural diversity.</p>"

Philosophical Perspectives On Newtonian Science (studies From The Johns Hopkins Center For The History & Philosophy Of Science),"['Phillip Bricker', 'R.i.g. Hughes']","<p>These original essays explore the philosophical implications of Newton's work. They address a wide range of topics including Newton's influence on his contemporaries and successors such as Locke and Kant, and his views on the methodology of science, on absolute space and time, and on the Deity.Howard Stein compares Newton's refusal to lock natural philosophy into a preexisting system with the more rigid philosophical predilections of his near-contemporaries Christian Huygens and John Locke. Richard Arthur's commentary provides a useful gloss on Stein's essay. Lawrence Sklar puzzles over Newton's attempts to provide a unified treatment of the various ""real quantities"": absolute space, time, and motion.</p>
<p> According to Phillip Bricker's responding essay, however, the distinctions Sklar draws do not go to the heart of the debate between realists and representationalists.J. E. McGuire and John Carriero debate Newtons views of the relationship between the Deity and the nature of time and space. Peter Achinstein looks at the tension between Newton's methodological views and his advocacy of a corpuscular theory of light; he suggests that Newton could justify the latter by a ""weak"" inductive inference, but R.I.G. Hughes believes that this inference involves an induction Newton would be unwilling to make. Immanuel Kant's critique of Newton's view of gravity is discussed and amplified by Michael Friedman In response, Robert DiSalle raises a number of problems for Friedman's analysis. Errol Harris and Philip Grier extend the discussion to the present day and look at the ethical implications of Newton's work.Phillip Bricker is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. R.I.G. Hughes is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Carolina.

Sustainability On Campus: Stories And Strategies For Change (urban And Industrial Environments),"['Barlett', 'Peggy F.']","<p>These personal narratives of greening college campuses offer inspiration, motivation,and practical advice. Written by faculty, staff, administrators, and a student, from varying perspectives and reflecting divergent experiences, these stories also map the growing strength of a national movement toward environmental responsibility on campus.Environmental awareness on college and university campuses began with the celebratory consciousness-raising of Earth Day, 1970. Since then environmental action on campus has been both global (in research and policy formation) and local (in efforts to make specific environmental improvements on campuses). The stories in this book show that achieving environmental sustainability is not a matter of applying the formulas of risk management or engineering technology but part of what the editors call ""the messy reality of participatory engagement in cultural transformation.""In Sustainability on Campus campus leaders recount inspiring stories of strategies that moved eighteen colleges and universities toward a more sustainable future. This book is for faculty, students, administrators, staff, and community partners, whether hesitant or committed, knowledgeable or newcomer. Scholars and activists have recognized the crucial role that higher education can play in the sustainability effort, and each chapter in the book is full of ideas about how to get started, revitalize efforts, and overcome roadblocks. Human and at times joyful, these stories illustrate many forms of leadership, in new courses and faculty development, green buildings and administrative policies, student programs,residential life, and collaborations with local communities.</p>"
Contradictions And Dilemmas: Studies On The Socialist Economy And Society,['János Kornai'],"<p>These seven essays by the Eastern block's most important economist address and explore many of the critical social and economic issues inherent in the socialist economy. Published in Hungary in 1983, they are the firsthand observations of an insider who attempts to be as frank and impartial as possible about the experiment in his own country.The essays distinguish the classical or traditional form of a highly centralized socialist economy from a system, like that of Hungary's, that is in the process of institutional reforms. They focus on a few important characteristics of social economies, rather than providing a broad description and analysis of socialist systems, in order to stimulate thinking along comparative lines. The wider problems and issues related to socialist systems that they address will interest sociologists and political scientists, historians, and philosophers as well as economists.Kornai points out that because real modern societies are different from the pure models of capitalism and socialism, combinations and mixtures of socialist and capitalist systems, sellers' and buyers' markets, centralized and decentralized management occur widely and intensively in both socialist and highly developed industrial market economies and in the nonsocialist third world countries in some segments and to a certain degree. Looking at these phenomena comparatively reveals both the deep differences and the similarities and analogies between the systems.The essays are: The Reproduction of Shortage. ""Hard""and ""Soft"" Budget Constraint. Degrees of Paternalism. Economics and Psychology. Comments on the Present State and the Prospects of the Hungarian Economic Reform.

Sexual Enslavement Of Girls And Women Worldwide (practicak And Applied Psychology),"['Andrea Parrot', 'Nina Cummings']","<p>They are in different countries but share the same hell. Maria is one of 14 women lured from Mexico to Seattle, Washington, with the promise of a job, then held by force in a brothel and required to sexually service men 12 hours a day. Anna is a young mother from the Ukraine who left her husband and children there to take a job as a housecleaner in Italy, where she was put in a barred, guarded house and forced into prostitution. Nadia is an 11-year-old girl in Africa, kidnapped and forced to have sex with a militiaman daily, with a machete ever ready nearby should she refuse. All three women are part of horrific sex slavery that has drawn the attention of officials in countries around the globe. It is not rare; officials say it is increasing, at least partly due to the billions of dollars it brings in for organized crime. The U.S. State Department estimates 800,000 victims, mostly women and children, are trafficked for sex trade across nations each year and millions more are trafficked within countries - including the U.S., Britain, Spain, and the Netherlands. As a <i>Seattle Times</i> reporter explained when Maria's case hit the news there, the reality is that sex slaves for the most part are young women and teenaged girls who come from almost every one of the world's poorer countries and end up in almost every country where there is a combination of sexual demand and money. But they are also in undeveloped Africa, in prisons internationally, locked in forced marriages, or sold to men by parents.</p>
<p>In this book, Parrot and Cummings outline the scope and growth of the sex slave market today and explain the history with various elements - including economic, political, cultural, and religious - that make this trade difficult to fully expose, quell, combat, and shut down. We hear from girls and women around the world describing how sexual enslavement has tortured them physically, emotionally, and spiritually, whether they suffer at the hands of prison guards in Turkey, criminals in Washington, or buyers dealing with parents who sell their daughters for the sex slave trade in Greece, Belgium, or France. The authors also describe national and international efforts and legislation passed or in design to stop sex slavery. Successful countries and regions are spotlighted. Then Parrot and Cummings point out actions still needed to stop the sex slavery trade.</p>"

His mother’s second husband is a licensed psychologist who eats like an ape, his stepsister is a stoner slut, and his father is engaged to a Southern belle. Rick’s only solace is his growing collection of original Broadway-cast LPs, bought on the sly at Wax Trax.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After he brings two girls in speech class to tears by reading a story aloud, Rick is coaxed onto the interscholastic forensics team to perform an eight-minute dramatic interpretation of <i>The Boys in the Band</i>, the controversial sixties play about homosexuality. Unexpectedly successful at this oddball event, Rick begins winning tournaments and making friends with his teammates.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rick also discovers the joys of sex—with a speech coach from a rival school—just as his mother, reacting to a deteriorating home environment, makes an unnerving commitment to Christ. The newly confident Rick assumes this too shall pass—until the combined forces of family, sex, and faith threaten to undo him at the state meet in Peoria.<br>

Evaluating The Impact Of Health Programs: A Primer (mit Press),"['Michael Borus', 'C. Gregory Buntz', 'William R Tash']","<p>This basic text presents a step-by-step impact evaluation methodology that can be used by students and administrators without prior exposure to the field. The treatment is nontechnical and sparing in its use of statistical technique and economic terminology, but it covers the major components required to perform the cost-benefit analyses that underlie reliable policy decisions. The book will be as useful to those who are called on to read evaluations as to those who prepare them.The focus of the primer is on impact evaluation of publicly supported programs designed to deliver comprehensive or specialized ambulatory health services. Impact evaluation, in the authors' usage, is concerned not only with whether specific goals are achieved but also with the unplanned and unanticipated effects and side-effects of programs. It offers a means for making improvements based on a program's total impact on its client population and the community at large.The methodology is applicable to a range of health-care operations as diverse in their structure, functions, and processes as community mental health centers, health maintenance organizations, professional service review organizations, and single-purpose medical intervention facilities, such as alcohol abuse and treatment centers, burn centers, and renal dialysis programs.</p>

Nelson begins by examining the theses that to understand oneself, a tradition, and history as a whole, they must be understood in the context of a narrative.</p><p>Recent philosophical writings on the relation of narrative to the moral concepts of social groups and individuals-including Alasdair MacIntyre's proposal for the rehabilitation of an ethic of virtue shaped by narrative-are explored. Issues discussed include the freedom of moral agents in relation to their narratives, the relation between narrative and universal moral rules, and the problem of relativism. Next, Nelson classifies theological uses of narrative as belonging to either a liberal-universalistic or postliberal-particularistic tradition and considers the implications of construing scripture as narrative for the problematic relation between scripture and ethics. The work of Stanley Hauerwas, the foremost narrativist in Christian ethics, is analyzed at length. Nelson argues that while narrative is a necessary focus, it does not exhaust the methodological agenda. Narrative is not, as its advocates sometimes suggest, a universal solvent for every theological problem and disagreement. An adequate Christian ethics must not lose sight of the universal, narrative-independent features of morality. Since the realm of the moral is an interweaving of narrative-dependent and narrative-independent features, Christian ethics stands to profit from both narrativist (coherentist) and rationalist (foundationalist) insights.</p><p>The role of narrative is demonstrably a major topic of conversation across several fields in religious studies today. Particularly designed for scholars in ethics, theology, and the philosophy of religion, the book is a reliable guide to an expanding literature and a judicious introduction to these interdisciplinary discussions.</p>"
The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History,['Hugh Trevor-Roper'],"<p>This book argues that while Anglo-Saxon culture has given rise to virtually no myths at all, myth has played a central role in the historical development of Scottish identity. Hugh Trevor-Roper explores three myths across 400 years of Scottish history: the political myth of the 'ancient constitution' of Scotland; the literary myth, including Walter Scott as well as Ossian and ancient poetry; and the sartorial myth of tartan and the kilt, invented-ironically, by Englishmen-in quite modern times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trevor-Roper reveals myth as an often deliberate cultural construction used to enshrine a peopleâs identity. While his treatment of Scottish myth is highly critical, indeed debunking, he shows how the ritualization and domestication of Scotlandâs myths as local color diverted the Scottish intelligentsia from the path that led German intellectuals to a dangerous myth of racial supremacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This compelling manuscript was left unpublished on Trevor-Roperâs death in 2003 and is now made available for the first time. Written with characteristic elegance, lucidity, and wit, and containing defiant and challenging opinions, it will absorb and provoke Scottish readers while intriguing many others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'I believe that the whole history of Scotland has been coloured by myth; and that myth, in Scotland, is never driven out by reality, or by reason, but lingers on until another myth has been discovered, or elaborated, to replace it.'ÂHugh Trevor-Roper</p>"
The Limits Of Power: The Nixon And Ford Administrations (america Since World War Ii Series),['John Robert Greene'],"<p>This book argues the thesis that during the Nixon and Ford administrations America discovered the limits of its power, and that both presidents had, therefore, to adjust to new realities in both their domestic and their international activities. It was also the period when the American people first insisted on certain limits to presidential activity, and even forced a powerful president from office for that reason. Like the distinguished preceding volumes in this series by Charles Alexander on Eisenhower and Jim Heath on the Kennedy-Johnson years, John Greene's book provides a balanced historical assessment of the Nixon and Ford administrations. The volume forcuses on both domestic and foreign policy and presents one of the first true historical judgments about these administrations.</p>"
In China's Shadow: The Crisis Of American Entrepreneurship (the Future Of American Democracy Series),['Reed Hundt'],"<p>This book begins with an eye-opening exploration of the rise of China’s economy and an assessment of its potential for further rapid growth. The implications of China’s new power are nothing short of profound, Reed Hundt contends. <i>In China's Shadow</i>&nbsp;proceeds to paint a detailed landscape of the new reality confronting American businesses and citizens. For the first time in over one hundred years, Americans face critical challenges to&nbsp;their economy and way of life&nbsp;owing not only&nbsp;to China’s impending economic might but also to the drift of U.S. business practices and government regulations over the past decade.<br>
Aiming for a respectable defeat in the competition of nations will imperil not only the American Dream of an ever-increasing standard of living but also the American project itself, Hundt warns. Meeting the foreseeable challenges is not a matter of legislative strategy from the political left or right or prescriptive plans for businesses. The best chance for Americans to lead the world in job and wealth creation lies in an expanded and renewed culture of entrepreneurship. Hundt reviews the lessons of the 1990s, when the architectures of law, technology, and leadership produced a robust culture of entrepreneurship, and analyzes how entrepreneurship is being undermined today. He challenges Americans to do what they do best—adapt, invent, innovate, take risks—and points the way for a reinvigorated entrepreneurial society.</p>"
Birds Of Africa: From Seabirds To Seed-eaters,"['Stuart, Chris']","<p>This book celebrates and provides a useful and highly readable introduction to Africa's magnificent avian diversity. Neither a field guide nor a biological text, it presents an overview of African birds and describes and depicts the lives and habits of almost 2,400 species.The African continent and its associated islands are home to the world's second largest assemblage of birds, spanning two of the planet's great faunal kingdoms. The authors have divided the birds into large groups, with each chapter focusing on a particular group. Each group shares a common characteristic easily recognized by the nonspecialist: preferred habitat, main feeding behavior, or breeding method. For ease of reference, the bird families comprising each chapter are discussed in alphabetical order.Although a great deal is known about the birds of Africa, much still awaits discovery. Entire species have yet to be described and entered into the scientific literature;sadly, some birds may become extinct before they can be properly studied. A recurring theme in the book is the threat to many species posed by the loss or dramatic modification of habitats and by human actions such as pesticide use, hunting for food and trade, and the destruction of forests. The authors emphasize that if current trends continue, more and more bird species will become endangered.</p>"
Voting The Gender Gap,['Lois Duke Whitaker'],"<p>This book concentrates on the gender gap in voting—the difference in the proportion of women and men voting for the same candidate. Evident in every presidential election since 1980, this polling phenomenon reached a high of 11 percentage points in the 1996 election. The contributors discuss the history, complexity, and ways of analyzing the gender gap; the gender gap in relation to partisanship; motherhood, ethnicity, and the impact of parental status on the gender gap; and the gender gap in races involving female candidates. <i>Voting the Gender Gap</i> analyzes trends in voting while probing how women's political empowerment and gender affect American politics and the electoral process.</p>

A New Season: Using Title Ix To Reform College Sports,['Brian Porto'],"<p>This book demonstrates how colleges might retain threatened varsity programs and expand sports opportunities for women students if they replaced the current commercial model with one that emphasizes student participation. This would benefit the college students who play varsity sports, instead of benefiting the coaches, athletic directors, or over-generous boosters who dominate many programs.</p>
<p>In Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education, schools have been handed a golden opportunity to bring fiscal sanity and academic integrity back to their campuses by once again making students, and not money, the focal point of athletic policies. This book demonstrates how colleges might retain threatened varsity programs and expand sports opportunities for women students if they replace the current commercial model with one that emphasizes student participation. This would benefit the college students who play varsity sports, instead of benefiting the coaches, athletic directors, or over-generous boosters who dominate many programs.</p>
<p>Reformist tinkering has done little to solve the deep-seated problems plaguing college sports. Porto argues that replacing the enormous commercial pressures corrupting college sports with a student-oriented participation model can solve these problems. Fiscal sanity, academic integrity, personal responsibility, and gender equity in college sports are possible. Faculty members can lead a broader movement to reclaim their institutions from the college sports industry. This book shows how college sports may once again be the integral part of the educational program the NCAA advertises them to be—and that they should be.</p>"
Building Self-esteem In At-risk Youth: Peer Group Programs And Individual Success Stories (cambridge Studies In Eighteenth-century),['Ivan C. Frank'],"<p>This book discusses peer group programs and long range community efforts to rehabilitate street youth, gang members, and other youth who have low self-esteem, come from dysfunctional families, and are failures in school and society in general. Through his experience and workshops, Frank has found ways for these youth to deal with their rage and shame in a productive, effective, and edifying manner. The author shows how behavior and attitude improve when the youths learn to curb their feelings of inadequacy by building positive self-esteem. This will be an excellent tool for educators, counselors, social workers, and others concerned with troubled adolescents.</p>"
Latin American Debt In The 1990s: Lessons From The Past And Forecasts For The Future,['Scott B. Macdonald'],"<p>This book examines the interrelationship between the external debt problem and the consolidation of democracy in Latin America in the 1990s. It considers the interplay of actors, including creditor governments, international financial institutions, debtor countries, commercial banks, and multinational corporations, and environment in the new decade, focusing on whether or not Latin America's political regimes can strengthen and democratize their respective economies while continuing to guarantee the country's democratic politics.</p>
<p>The foreign debt problem casts an especially long shadow on the Latin American democracies. While important in its own right, understanding the Latin American experience is also essential in light of changes in Eastern Europe. Despite many obvious cultural differences and historical experiences, there are many parellels between the two regions--democratization at a time of economic crisis and of heavy external debt. This important new book underscores the lessons of the Latin American experience, making it essential reading for anyone concerned with the global economy.</p>"
Gorbachev's New Thinking On Terrorism (the Washington Papers),['Galia Golan'],"<p>This book examines the reevaluation of Soviet foreign policy under Gorbachev, known as the ""new thinking."" This new foreign policy has produced a new Soviet attitude and, apparently, different behavior toward terrorism. In the past, terrorism was officially condemned either as a method employed by imperialist or capitalist regimes against an oppressed population or as an illegitimate offshoot of armed struggle, having nothing in common with genuine liberation struggles. Under Gorbachev, there is a reduction in Soviet aid to many groups using terrorism and a call for political solutions to ongoing conflicts. The latest volume in The Washington Papers series, Gorbachev's ""New Thinking"" on Terrorism will be of special interest to political scientists, Soviet specialists, or anyone interested in terrorism today. With a foreword by Walter laqueur Laqueur, this book begins with a detailed background study of Soviet attitudes toward terrorism, demonstrating the changes in Gorbachev's approach to the problem. Galia Golan, Darwin professor of Soviet and East European Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, defines the differences between Gorbachev's rhetoric and the reality of the ""new thinking"" as the book explores reports and rumors of Soviet involvement in Pakistan and the Philippines. The book concludes with a look at current Soviet policy toward terrorist groups traditionally backed by the Soviet Union.</p>"
Lesbian Family Relationships In American Society: The Making Of An Ethnographic Film,"['Asten, Maureen A. , 1957-']","<p>This book explores intimate relationships in lesbian families living in American society. From an insider's point of view, it examines how relationships within these families form and develop, what special concerns and problems result, what personal gains the family members derive from these types of families, and how motherhood and parenthood evolve. This work is a companion to Dr. Asten's ethnographic video, <i>Intimate Relationships in Three Lesbian Families Living in American Society</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the literature on lesbian families compares heterosexual families to lesbian families and uses the researcher's perspective as the core unit of analysis. In contrast, this work is an interrelated filmed/written ethnography which is the result of participant observation and feminist participatory research. It includes not only the researcher's data analysis but also the participants' reaction to and interaction with the process. Providing a unique understanding of the diversity of the American family, this is an important contribution to the growing fields of lesbian/feminist studies and visual anthropology, as well as sociology and psychology. For a copy of the video, <i>Intimate Relationships in Three Lesbian Families Living in American Society</i>, that accompanies this book, contact Dr. Maureen A. Asten, 1 Fifth Avenue, Shrewsbury, MA 01545. Telephone: (508) 799-9746.</p>"
Through Students' Eyes,['Karen B. Donaldson'],"<p>This book explores racism in American schools and provides possible solutions to this widespread problem. Dr. Donaldson documents recent incidents of racism and explores the manifestations of racism and its toll on our society. The major part of Donaldson's work focuses on the role of the arts in antiracist/multicultural education. She brings together the views of leaders in multicultural education with her own insights to substantiate the importance of the arts in fighting racism. Dr. Donaldson focuses her research on high school students, discovering that even high achievers perceive racism as a deterrent to their learning. The students most often perceive racism as a problem caused by adults, and Donaldson shows that multicultural arts can empower students to stand against this racism. Finally, Donaldson explores the reeducation of teachers in an antiracist, interdisciplinary curriculum development and implementation pilot study.</p>"

"Accommodating Protest: Working Women, The New Veiling, And Change In Cairo",['Arlene Macleod'],"<p>This book explores the puzzling phenomenon of new veiling practices among lower middle class women in Cairo, Egypt. Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained?</p>
<p>An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women's protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.</p>

Privatisation Performance In Major European Countries Since 1980,['M. Tatahi'],"<p>This book investigates performance of both private and state-owned enterprises since the advent of the intensive privatization programmes in Europe at the beginning of the 1980s. Major theoretical approaches, such as the property rights theory, the principal agent theory, the Austrian school of economics and the public choice school, stress the superiority of privately-owned over state-owned companies without addressing how corporate performance should best be measured. With problems existing with standard measures of corporate performance, another method, namely factor analysis, is applied in this volume to best compare the two states.</p>"
"Nuclear Winter, Deterrence, And The Prevention Of Nuclear War",['Peter C. Sederberg'],"<p>This book is comprised of essays by nationally recognized scholars and public figures who urge a reassessment of the impact of the nuclear winter hypothesis on current ideas of nuclear deterrence, limited nuclear war, and war fighting doctrines. It provides a timely discussion of the policy implications of the possible effects of nuclear war and creates a dialogue between those who believe that established deterrence policies are adequate and those arguing for a radical reconstruction of those policies. The book also addresses issues touching on the politics of prevention, identifying policies that should be adopted to prevent nuclear war, and the concerned citizens' role in this process.</p>"
"Schools, Violence, And Society:",['Allan M. Hoffman'],"<p>This book is designed to examine issues related to schools, violence, and society. Since the 1960s, crime and violence have been increasing in America's schools. This violence is not limited to inner-city schools, but has struck virtually every strata and socio-economic level of American culture and society. The prevalence of crime and violence occurring in our nation's schools has become the concern of policymakers on the national and state levels. Concern has spread to parents, educators, and students themselves. This edited volume reviews violence in society, school violence, and crime. Coverage includes past trends in school violence and describes the current extent of the problem, as well as tspects of its causes and prevention. The influence on the students and community of gang activity, gang-related issues, drugs, alcohol, and weapons on campus is discussed.</p>"
Are There Any Good Jobs Left?: Career Management In The Age Of The Disposable Worker,['R. William Holland'],"<p>This book is for and about the millions of people who are between jobs (code for out of work), have been between jobs, or know of someone who has been. It is about how to navigate the transition from employment-for-life, career development support, and a company-sponsored pension to downsized, outsourced, and replaced. Bill Holland explains the macro-trends that have converged to create an environment of job instability and anxiety, and then moves beyond this context to present specific tactics and techniques that readers can use to stay one step ahead in their careers. More than a manual for job searches and career-building strategies, <i>Are There Any Good Jobs Left?</i> helps readers interpret trends, assess such temptations as leaving the corporate rat race for the entrepreneurial life and considers the ethics of constant networking. Featuring an annotated listing of books and Web sites, the book is not so much an indictment of corporate disloyalty as an explanation of the phenomenon, and a guidebook for anyone faced with job transition, change, or growth in today's turbulent environment.</p>

The Shadow World: Life Between the News Media and Reality,['Jim Willis'],"<p>This book looks at the news media's portrayal of reality and seeks answers as to why this portrayal often falls short of reality itself. Jim Willis examines the factors that contribute to the journalist's often faulty perception of reality, factors that are beyond the immediate control of the reporter; errant sources, competitive influences, the embedding process of storytelling, marketing's influence on the news, and the structure of news stories. The book stresses that the reporting process is more difficult than most critics and reporters realize, and points out that the best reporters are those who will take time to recognize challenges and work to overcome them. Ideal as a supplementary text for advanced courses in reporting, The Shadow World focuses on the complexities of good reporting. It studies the challenges that face today's journalist and provides practical guidance for the novice reporter. Studying actual reporting cases, Willis discusses the difference between seeking accuracy and seeking truth in journalism. He examines state-of-the-art methods of good reporting and stresses the need for specializing, remembering the larger truth, treating rumors as rumors, and following appropriate role models. A useful guide discussing the full range of philosophical, theoretical, and practical considerations influencing the reporter, The Shadow World will be a valuable resource for the student of journalism.</p>"
The Specialized Society: The Plight Of The Individual In An Age Of Individualism (bibliographies And Indexes In Library),['Fathali M. Moghaddam'],"<p>This book offers a broad-based critical examination of the consequences—moral, psychological, sociological, educational, and economic—of increasing specialization in today's world. According to the author, we have now reached a stage where the education and professional work of both elite and non-elite groups are so narrowly focused as to diminish both the individual and society. The development of the complete individual has given way to the development of a complete collective, made up of narrowly focused, fragmented individuals. And educators—the very people who should be able to lead us out of this path of increasing specalization—have themselves fallen victim, unable to function outside their own specialized areas of expertise. This controversial work will be of interest to scholars and students in social psychology, philosophy, educational foundations, economics, Third World development, and business—in short, to all thinking members of modern society.</p>"
Irish Rural Interiors In Art,"['Kinmonth, Claudia.']","<p>This book offers a fascinating view of many aspects of Irish rural life from the eighteenth to the mid twentieth century. Illustrated with more than 250 images, many of which have not been published before, the book evokes the hardships and celebrations of laborers and farmers, men and women, the old and the young as depicted in oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, prints, postcards, and cartoons. Most of the illustrations show people engaged in indoor activities at home, but schools, shops, pubs, and doctors’ surgeries are also included. Claudia Kinmonth draws on extensive knowledge of the material culture of rural life to present a new social history of Irish country people.<br>
Working within a broadly chronological framework, the author addresses such themes and patterns of rural life as the architecture of houses, where people slept, cooking over the open hearth, rural dress, display, childcare, work within the home, the arrangement of marriages, weddings, wakes, and celebrations. The book also explores why Irish and foreign artists depicted rural interiors and sets their work in the context of art history.</p>"

"The Church, Society, And Hegemony: A Critical Sociology Of Religion In Latin America","['Carlos Alberto Torres', 'Richard A. Young']","<p>This book provides a critical sociology of religion in Latin America. Its purpose is to discuss the notion of religion as part of social, cultural, and political processes in capitalist societies, drawing on the classics of sociological thought (Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Gramsci). Thus, churches are analyzed as organized institutions of religious mediation intimately linked to the production of social, cultural, and political hegemony in Latin America. The Catholic Church, the dominant church in the region, is analyzed in terms of its different faces, changes, and transformations from conquest and colonization through the changing winds of Vatican II to the revolutionary experiences of the popular church in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>This work will be of interest to scholars of Latin American studies, politics, religion, culture, and sociology. It also speaks to theologians and philosophers working in Latin America.</p>"
Lone wolf: the life and death of U-boat ace Werner Henke,"['Mulligan, Timothy.']","<p>This book relates the life and the death of the rebel German seaman who became one of the most successful U-Boat commanders of World War II. The story of Werner Henke--and a narrative outlining the history of his boat, U-515, and its crew--forms the basis for a biography of a man who defies the stereotypes of German character, who never fit in as a career officer in the German Navy, but who chose a suicidal death in acceptance of the code of the military service whose rules he continually bent and broke. Though the story Mulligan relates is engrossing and action-packed, it is also a carefully documented study that breaks new ground in uncovering the sociological background of Henke and his crew; in short, it is a study in German history as well as a biography of a U-Boat Commander.</p>
<p>Examining the backgrounds and attitudes of the crew, including their views on Hitler and the treatment of the Jews, Mulligan sheds new light on the men who constituted an elite in Hitler's Wehrmacht. The story of U-515 is also closely correlated to the overall conduct of the U-Boat war, including assessments of Karl Donitz's strategy, the influence of technological innovations, and the contributions of Allied signal intelligence. Henke's confrontation with the Gestapo and a detailed account of the sinking of the passenger liner Ceramic further add to the story, revealing the complex reality behind an image too long dominated by propaganda stereotypes.</p>"
Making U.s. Foreign Policy Toward South Asia: Regional Imperatives And The Imperial Presidency,"['Rudolph', 'Lloyd I.']","<p>This book situates U.S. foreign policy processes in the contexts of three imperial presidencies: the administrations of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and George W. Bush. The contributors examine the changing contours of U.S. relations with South Asian states through two contrasting models of presidential policy making: imperative coordination, which is based on hierarchy and command and executed by presidents' men who serve at his pleasure and are committed to his partisan interests in the near term; and deliberative coordination, based on collegiality and persuasion and executed by foreign policy and military professionals knowledgeable about the regional, bi-lateral, and global dimensions of national interests and national security.</p>"
The Palestine Liberation Organization: From Armed Struggle To The Declaration Of Independence,"['Nassar, Jamal R. (jamal Raji)']","<p>This book takes a comprehensive look at the PLO, examining its origins, legal status, goals, and strategies. Jamal R. Nassar investigates the PLO's role in regional and international politics and unveils the dynamics of the power relationships responsible for the organization's successes and failures. The book discerns patterns and trends in the PLO's activities and studies the conditions under which these patterns and trends develop. Nassar places the PLO in a global perspective, delving into the basis of the organization's legitimacy and its prospects for participation in the peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The book's organization and comprehensive coverage--beginning with a thorough historical background of the Palestinian experience--make it an excellent study for the student of Middle Eastern politics.</p>
<p>Nassar probes the rise of the PLO to its present position as a major actor in the Middle East--one that is no less significant than a number of sovereign states. He shows that the PLO is a complex power that cannot hope to achieve its objectives independently of other regional powers but can prevent these powers from resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute. The book outlines the many peace initiatives that have been foiled by the PLO and reveals how Israel's refusal to talk to the PLO will likely thwart the achievement of peace. Students and scholars of Middle East and Palestinian politics, the Arab-Israeli conflict, terrorism, political ideologies, revolutionary movements, transnational politics, and contemporary history will find Jamal Nassar's book on the PLO an invaluable resource.</p>"
An Auto Worker's Journal: The Uaw From Crusade To One-party Union,['Frank Marquart'],"<p>This book traces the evolution of the United Auto Workers—and, by extension, U.S. industrial unionism as a whole—through the experiences of a man who began as a bench hand in 1914 and retired from the International UAW education department in 1963. The author's thesis is stated in his first chapter: ""Time was when the American labor movement was respected as a force for social justice. Certainly this view was widely held in early CIO days. Today, however, even liberals regard unions as bureaucratized self-interest establishments. . . . But I know this is not the end of the process . . . .""</p>
<p>Leaving Pittsburgh at the age of fourteen, when his father was laid off, Marquart was drawn to Detroit by Henry Ford's revolutionary five dollars a day wage—and landed in a metal shop at ten cents an hour. At the age of seventeen, through an English fellow worker, he learned about unionism and the Labor Party, became a Young Socialist, and experienced the Palmer Raids. He also joined the Auto Workers Union, which the AFL suspended in 1917 for organizing on industrial rather than craft lines.</p>
<p>After being laid off in 1930, Marquart spend six years as a ""freelance soap boxer,"" hobo, broom salesman, patient in a TB sanitorium, and WPA Workers Education staffer, becoming education director of the UAW Dodge Local in 1937. After experiencing the Dodge sit-down strike, he moved to the Ford local, where he was ousted by the Stalinist faction. He then moved to the most militant GM local, where he taught part-time for the University of Michigan Labor and Industrial Relations Institute, before his final assignment with the UAW International headquarters.

The Myth Of Judicial Activism: Making Sense Of Supreme Court Decisions,['Kermit Roosevelt Iii'],"<p>This carefully considered book is a welcome addition to the debate over ""judicial activism.” Constitutional scholar Kermit Roosevelt III offers an elegantly simple way to resolve the heated discord between conservatives, who argue that the Constitution is immutable, and progressives, who insist that it is a living document that must be reinterpreted in new cultural contexts so that its meaning evolves. Roosevelt uses plain language and compelling examples to explain how the Constitution can be both a constant and an organic document.</p>
<p>Recent years have witnessed an increasing drumbeat of complaints about judicial behavior, focusing particularly on Supreme Court decisions that critics charge are reflections of the Justices’ political preferences rather than enforcement of the Constitution. The author takes a balanced look at these controversial decisions through a compelling new lens of constitutional interpretation. He clarifies the task of the Supreme Court in constitutional cases, then sets out a model to describe how the Court creates doctrine to implement the meaning of the Constitution. Finally, Roosevelt uses this model to show which decisions can be justified as legitimate and which cannot.</p>"

Korean Managerial Dynamics:,"['Hak Chong Lee', 'Kae H. Chung']","<p>This contributor volume is the first effort to examine the management practices behind Korea's successful transformation from an underdeveloped nation into a major player in world trade. Economists, journalists, and policy makers worldwide study the success story and point to the economic policies of government, a well-disciplined labor force, and a homogeneous culture. However, these factors should not overshadow the important roles played by corporate entrepreneurs and managers. Divided into five parts, this volume focuses on the business environment in which Korean firms operate, the corporate ownership structure, corporate strategies, managerial practices, and finally human resource management within Korean firms. Korean Managerial Dynamics raises a series of questions relating to the managerial practices of Korean firms and offers answers to these questions: What makes Korean managers tick? How does the government influence managerial practices? What kind of strategies and structure have Korean firms developed? To what extent do they rely on foreign technology? What are the similarities and differences with American or Japanese firms? Do traditional values influence managerial practices? Can Korean firms develop a corporate culture that can effectively function in an advanced industrial society? These are but a few of the questions discussed in this book.</p>"
Attitude Psychology And The Study Of Public Opinion,"['Chisman, Forrest P. , 1944-']","<p>This critical analysis of political behavior studies has prime importance for students of social and behavioral science—as well as journalists and politicians—in view of the enormous influence of such studies.</p>
<p>The author finds studies that attempt to combine attitude psychology with traditional ideas about public opinion seriously wanting because of their neglect of the impact of issues as individual voters perceive them. Public opinion researchers have failed to identify motives for votes largely because they have assumed that each citizen's choices must be determined by attitudes toward matters of general concern. ""They do not consider the possibility that votes might be determined by attitudes toward a variety of different matters, each of concern fairly few people.""</p>
<p>The relationship of public opinion to government decision making also is unexplained, Dr. Chisman holds, because of the assumption that ""correspondences between government decisions and public views must be due to the influence of public opinion, transmitted by members of the public elite, upon members of government."" Neglected is the reverse possibility: "" these correspondences might be due to the influence of government and the elite upon public opinion.""</p>"
"Private Choices, Social Costs, And Public Policy: An Economic Analysis Of Public Health Issues","['Hammerle, Nancy.']","<p>This data-rich work examines today's most compelling and controversial public health issues, including alcohol and drug abuse, AIDS, abortion, black and infant mortality, drug-affected babies, child abuse, teenage pregnancy, and cigarette smoking. Hammerle's theme is that individual behavioral choices often have far-reaching and costly effects. When practiced by large numbers of people, the human and fiscal costs can be monumental, taxing virtually all of our social systems as well as our financial resources. Hammerle enumerates these costs and, employing economic analytical tools, recommends public policies that will reduce the incidence of such behavior or otherwise reduce its social cost. Some recommendations are outside the mainstream, but all are well substantiated and soundly argued.</p>
<p>This volume will be of great interest to academics, practitioners, and policy-makers in the fields of public health, health care administration, public policy, child protection, and family planning. The work will also interest economists and sociologists in the field of social welfare, as well as lay persons who are concerned about these timely public health issues.</p>"

The Encyclopedia Of Colonial And Revolutionary America,['John Mack Faragher'],"<p>This encyclopedia, based on the latest research, unfolds in 1500 entries the entire colonial period, from the earliest settlements in 1600 through the American Revolution to nationhood under the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Its comprehensive scope includes standard topics like discoveries and battles; biographical entries on all the major colonial and revolutionary figures as well as lesser-known people from French and Spanish America, Russian explorers, colonial women, and important Indian leaders; every major conflict, from the French and Indian Wars through Pontiac's Rebellion to the American victory at Yorktown; lengthy articles on each of the original thirteen colonies; separate entries for all of the major Indian tribes as well as for subjects like abortion and contraception, crime and punishment, disease, education, free blacks, Loyalists, medicine, piracy, race and racism, science, slavery, witchcraft, and much more.Special attention has been paid to new fields of study, such as the ethno-history of American Indians, women’s history, and demography.

A History Of Modern Computing (history Of Computing),['Paul E. Ceruzzi'],"<p>This engaging history covers modern computing from the development of the first electronic digital computer through the dot-com crash. The author concentrates on five key moments of transition: the transformation of the computer in the late 1940s from a specialized scientific instrument to a commercial product; the emergence of small systems in the late 1960s; the beginning of personal computing in the 1970s; the spread of networking after 1985; and, in a chapter written for this edition, the period 1995-2001. The new material focuses on the Microsoft antitrust suit,the rise and fall of the dot-coms, and the advent of open source software, particularly Linux.Within the chronological narrative, the book traces several overlapping threads: the evolution of the computer's internal design; the effect of economic trends and the Cold War; the long-term role of IBM as a player and as a target for upstart entrepreneurs; the growth of software from a hidden element to a major character in the story of computing; and the recurring issue of the place of information and computing in a democratic society. The focus is on the United States (though Europe and Japan enter the story at crucial points), on computing per se rather than on applications such as artificial intelligence, and on systems that were sold commercially and installed in quantities.</p>"
Circus queen & Tinker Bell: the memoir of Tiny Kline,"['Kline, Tiny , 1890-1964']","<p>This engaging memoir follows the life and career of circus performer Tiny Kline (1891-1964) from the burlesque house to the circus tent, and on to Disneyland and the silver screen. While working for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Kline became well known for her signature ""slide for life"" stunt, an ""iron jaw"" act in which she slid to the ground while dangling from trapeze rigging by her teeth. Kline renewed her spectacular acrobatics at the age of seventy when she played Tinker Bell in the ""Fantasy in the Sky"" fireworks show at Disneyland. In that same year, she also began writing her life story.</p>
<p>Extensively annotated by Janet M. Davis, this memoir documents twentieth-century changes in popular amusements, while providing fresh insight into circus personalities such as John Ringling, acrobat Lillian Leitzel, and big cat trainer Mabel Stark, as well as mainstream entertainers like Florenz Ziegfeld, John Philip Sousa, and others. Kline also provides intimate details about the daily machinations at the circus, including fascinating accounts of its sexual politics, racial dynamics, risky nature, and labor relations.</p>"
The Castle Of Dreams (mit Press),['Michel Jouvet'],"<p>This enlightening, entertaining, and intriguing novel begins as a story within a story—or a story within a trunk. A Frenchman—our narrator, presumably the author Michel Jouvet, or a literary version of himself—buys an antique chest with brass fittings, labeled with the initials HLS and a partially worn away date, ""178-."" Happy to have such a handsome piece for his hallway, the narrator is surprised to find within it bundles of ancient papers tied with string. He has discovered the dream journals, experiments, and correspondence of eighteenth-century amateur scientist Hugues la Scève. With Jouvet, a recognized authority on sleep and dream research, as our guide, we follow la Scève's quest to unlock the mystery of dreams. In his chateau and elsewhere, la Scève undertakes a series of complex and often comic experiments: he records his own dreams and speculates on their relation to waking life; he studies sleeping cats, rabbits, and other animals (and observes rapid eye movement almost two centuries before modern science discovers it); he records the sleep and dream experiences of a Swiss soldier and a pair of Siamese twins. And, because sleep and dreams are often in close proximity to the erotic, he considers the relation of dreaming and sexual activity, heroically undertaking first-hand research with various women (with the notable exception of his wife). La Scève's fantastic experiments and discoveries have a solid scientific basis: Jouvet has transposed some of his own cutting-edge research to the context of the eighteenth century—when scientific knowledge was more limited, but the joy of scientific study was more widespread. La Scève's experiments are a testament to the power of scientific observation. The tale that Jouvet discovered buried in the old chest could have been true.</p>"
End-of-life Decision Making: A Cross-national Study (basic Bioethics),"['Blank, Robert H.', 'Merrick, Janna C.']","<p>This examination of end-of-life decision making offers a broader perspective than that found in the extensive existing literature on this topic by offering a cross-national comparison. Experts from twelve countries analyze death-related issues and policies in their respective nations, discussing such topics as health care costs, advance directives or wills, pain management, and cultural, social, and religious factors. The countries selected for study — Brazil,China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Kenya, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom,and the United States — represent a mix of East and West, developed and developing nations seldom considered together in analyses of these issues. This is the first systematic attempt to analyze end-of-life issues in many of these countries; the chapters on China, Kenya (of special significance because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa) and Turkey break new ground.Each author reports on various factors in end-of-life decisions: estimated costs of dying, including health care costs; the proportion of deaths occurring in hospitals, in hospices, and at home; the prevalence and variety of advance directives; the mix of high technology and palliative care; the cut-off point for aggressive care and the legal definition of death; government policies on end-of-life decisions,assisted suicide, and euthanasia; and cultural, social, and religious influences. The findings show that there are great differences among countries even in the way these issues are framed. Scholars,policymakers, and medical practitioners can all benefit from the extensive information in these essays on how different nations are dealing with death-related issues.</p>"

Violence In Dating Relationships: Emerging Social Issues,['Maureen A. Pirog-good'],"<p>This extremely valuable collection of fourteen chapters is divided into two sections, with the first section covering research on physical abuse in dating relationships and the second section covering the issue of sexual abuse in dating relationships. With the increasing public awareness of and concern about acquaintance rape, this is an excellent and timely book. It should be in the library of any researcher who studies violence against women and it would also be an invaluable resource for any college faculty or administrator who seeks to provide a healthy educational environment for all students. <i>The Community Psychologist</i></p>
<p>Fourteen significant articles on physical and sexual abuse in dating relationships provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary review of the subject. The contributors to this anthology examine every aspect of the serious, but usually hidden social problems of dating violence. The articles create a theoretical framework for understanding physical and sexual abuse and chronicle the antecedents and consequences of different types of abusive behavior. State of the art research on dating violence provides the reader with extensive material. Each chapter ends with policy implications and directions for future research. Educators, researchers, and practitioners in sociology, criminology, psychology, psychiatry, and women's studies will find valuable information on this important subject.</p>
<p>The first part of the collection presents statistical information and compares dating violence with cohabitating and marital violence. Such subjects as courtship aggression and the effects of gender identity and self-esteem on dating violence are explored. One study suggests two types of courtship violence--predatory violence and relational violence. Another addresses patterns in help seeking behavior by those abused. The second part of the book deals with sexual aggression in dating relationships. Victimization, as well as the prevalence, risk factors, and long term consequences of date rape are presented. Other topics include predictors of sexual aggression, dating behaviors and their relationship to the risk of date rape, and acquaintance rape.</p>"

Silk,['Mary Schoeser'],"<p>This gorgeously illustrated volume not only offers a tour through the fascinating history of silk but also a glimpse into the future, when imaginative designers and textile producers will be changing the boundaries of what is possible with this extraordinary material. Textile expert Mary Schoeser presents an authoritative account of the development of silk, its properties and practical uses, and its role in some of the greatest achievements in the history of fashion design.<br>
Silk is magical. Made by worms, it is able to absorb up to thirty times its weight in water, it is warmer than wool, and it is unsurpassed for beauty and touch. Schoeser focuses keen attention on silk’s evolution as a symbol of status and substance, then traces its central function in 19th- and 20th-century glamour, expressed through the work of designers from Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga to Emmanuel Ungaro. Schoeser also examines the innovative use of silk by today’s cutting-edge designers, among them Alexander McQueen, Issey Miyake, and John Galliano of Dior. She concludes with a detailed investigation of new silk technologies and how they continue to extend both the physical properties of silk and the possibilities for creative design.</p>"
"Cubism In The Shadow Of War: The Avant-garde And Politics In Paris, 1905-1914",['David Cottington'],"<p>This groundbreaking book provides a major reassessment of the history and significance of cubism. David Cottington examines the cubist movement and sets it within the complex political, economic, and cultural forces of pre-World War I France. Cubism, as a part of the Parisian artistic avant-garde, played an integral role in the turbulent Belle Epoque. The author focuses on cubism's relation to the particular discourses—of nationalism, aestheticism, gender, the social purpose of art—that gave meaning to the experience of modernity in Paris in the decade before the war.<br>
<br>
In Part I of the book, the author discusses the ""cubist conjuncture,"" the years that followed the collapse of the Bloc des Gauches. The Bloc, more than a parliamentary alliance, represented an effort of collaboration between the liberal middle class and sectors of the working class led by Parisian intellectuals and artists (future cubists among them). In the wake of the Bloc's failure, workers withdrew into trade unionism and artists into aesthetic avant-gardism. Cottington analyzes this consolidation of the artistic avant-garde, its relation to the expanding dealer-centered art market, and the dominant and counter discourses of the day. In Part II, he considers specific aspects of cubist art and the cubist movement—from the conservative modernism of the paintings of Le Fauconnier and Gleizes to the aestheticism of Picasso's papiers-collés to the collective architectural and interior design project of the ""cubist house."" These examples and others, Cottington concludes, reveal cubism as a contradictory and unstable constellation of interests and practices, sometimes complicit with dominantsocial and political forces, sometimes opposed to them, but in every case shaped by them.<br>

Fighting Words: The Politics Of Hateful Speech,"['Laurence R. Marcus', 'Lawrence R. Marcus']","<p>This intriguing book reflects on the conditions on college campuses that give rise to words and acts of hate, on the consequences of these episodes, and on strategies intended to improve intergroup harmony. Using the speech given by Nation of Islam spokesperson Khalid Abdul Muhammad at Kean College in 1993, the book begins with a consideration of the societal trends affecting today's college student, including the increasing economic uncertainty that characterizes their future and the hostility and fragmentation that characterizes their present. Attitudinal changes have proven to be widespread, as more Americans have begun to view the world through the lenses of political, social, and economic self-interest, calling prevailing equity policy into question and giving new life to identity politics. Since issues of affirmative action, multiculturalism, and political correctness are at the core of the national debate and command the attention of college students, each is addressed in detail. A discussion of what prompted Kean students to invite Muhammad follows a consideration of the current status of intergroup relations on campuses across the nation. This examination covers the inescapable conclusion that, despite the desires of most students for positive relations with people of other groups, there are serious gaps to be bridged.</p>"

Raising Your Child's Inner Self-esteem,['Karen Owens'],"<p>This invaluable guide is designed to help parents and counselors build self-esteem in children from infancy through adolescence, fortifying them with a healthy sense of self-esteem for the rest of their lives. Whereas some professionals are content to teach parents about building only outer self-esteem, as in parents unconditionally praising the children, Dr. Owens believes it is also essential to bolster a child's inner self-esteem. This way a child feels good from within, knows objectively that he's doing a good job, and is not solely dependent on the praise of others. While Dr. Owens believes strongly that parents must give children unconditional love, she is well aware that the world can be a harsh and difficult place. Therefore, she shows that the best gift a parent can give one's children is the tools to acquire the skills and behavior that will enable them to feel good about themselves - from within. This unique book imparts vital information on how parents can instill a sense of pride in their child each step of the way as the child's mind grows in perception and logic. Dr. Owens explains what behavior to expect from children at each developmental stage. She also supplies ample questionnaires so parents can determine the state of their children's sense of self-esteem. Most important, she wisely recognizes the needs of special groups of children. She thus offers specific advice for boosting the self-esteem of children who are shy, aggressive, unpopular, learning disabled, or gifted, as well as adopted children, only children, and children of working mothers, divorced parents, step-families, single parents, and same-sex parents.</p>"
1945: The War That Never Ended,['Gregor Dallas'],"<p>This is a masterpiece of historical writing, a book that compels its readers to reflect anew on the shaping forces of history.

Political Forces In Argentina,"['Snow, Peter G.']","<p>This is a revised and updated edition of Snow's classic study of Argentine politics. The work is a description and analysis of the role played by Argentina's major political actors: the political parties, the armed forces, labor unions, the Catholic Church, and students. Their traditional roles are examined, but emphasis is placed on the part they have played since publication of the last edition of the work in 1979, especially the dramatic transition to democracy beginning in 1983. Snow and his new co-author, Manzetti, are slightly more optimistic than most analysts, and believe that Argentina's major political actors may have finally decided that authoritarian regimes are not to their--nor Argentina's--advantage.</p>

Nuclear Strategizing: Deterrence And Reality,"['Cimbala, Stephen J.']","<p>This is an excellent advanced study in strategy in the nuclear age. Cimbala covers the field thoroughly.

<p>Cimbala critically examines the rational behind Western defense policies based on deterrence. According to the author, nuclear strategizing--or coping with outside threats--is shortsighted--dependent as it is on economic analogies and technical fixation. It leaves unanswered important questions about the relationships between strategy, politics, and long-term defense goals. Cimbala examines a number of issues from this point of departure, including: arms control, de-escalation and escalation, control of nuclear forecast, and the future of conventional forces.</p>"

<p><i>The Coming of the Cataclysm</i> starts with the great famine of the early 1960s, which resulted in tens of millions of deaths and set in train a series of emergency measures that increasingly divided Mao from his comrades-in-arms. His anger that they were prepared to adopt ""capitalist"" methods to rescue the country was sharpened by his belief that Moscow had actually gone capitalist and sold out to the ""imperialist"" West. From 1961 to 1966, the period covered by this volume, the increasingly urgent question for Mao was how to prevent a similar revolutionary degeneration in China. The Cultural Revolution was his answer.</p>
<p>Drawing upon new evidence from Party documents, personal interviews, books, and journals, MacFarquhar details the growing rift between Mao and his colleagues as they attempted to cope with domestic privation and an increasingly hostile international environment — until the Chairman finally decided to smash the unity of the Yan'an Round Table by unleashing society against the party-state.</p>

The Kindness Of Strangers: The Life Of Tennessee Williams,['Donald Spoto'],"<p>This is the first complete, critical biography of Tennessee Williams (19111983), one of America's finest playwrights and the author of (among many important works) <i>The Glass Menagerie, Summer and Smoke, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Suddenly Last Summer,</i> and <i>The Night of the Iguana.</i> Award-winning biographer Donald Spoto gives us not only a full and accurate account of Williams's life, he also reveals the intimate connections between the playwright's personal dramas and his remarkably autobiographical art. From his birth into a genteel Southern family, through his success, celebrity, and wealth, to his drug addictions, promiscuity, and creative struggles, Tennessee Williams lived a life as gripping as his plays. <i>The Kindness of Strangers,</i> based on Williams's own papers, his mother's diaries, and interviews with scores of friends, lovers, and professional associates, is, in the author's words, a portrait of ""a man more disturbing, more dramatic, richer and more wonderful than any character he created.""</p>"
Constitutional History Of The American Revolution: The Authority To Legislate,['John Phillip Reid'],"<p>This is the first comprehensive study of the constitutionality of the Parliamentary legislation cited by the American Continental Congress as a justification for its rebellion against Great Britain in 1776.&nbsp; The content and purpose of that legislation is well known to historians, but here Reid places it in the context of eighteenth-century constitutional doctrine and discusses its legality in terms of the intellectual premises of eighteenth-century Anglo-American legal values.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third installment in a planned four-volume work, <i>The Authority to Legislate</i>&nbsp; follows <i>The Authority to Tax</i> and <i>The Authority of Rights</i>.&nbsp; In this volume, Reid shows that the inflexibility of British constitutional principle left no room for settlement or change;&nbsp; Parliament became entrapped by the imperatives of the constitution it was struggling to preserve.&nbsp; He analyzes the legal theories put forward in support of Parliament’s authority to legislate and the specific precedents cited as evidence of that authority.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reid’s examination of both the debate over the authority to legislate and the constitutional theory underlying the debate shows the extent to which the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence were actions taken in defense of the rule of law.&nbsp; Considered as a whole, Reid’s <i>Constitutional History of the American Revolution</i> contributes to an understanding of the central role of legal and constitutional standards, especially concern for rule by law, in the development of the American nation.</p>"
Constitutional History Of The American Revolution: The Authority Of Law: Volume 4,['John Phillip Reid'],"<p>This is the first comprehensive study of the constitutionality of the Parliamentary legislation cited by the American Continental Congress as a justification for its rebellion against Great Britain in 1776.&nbsp; The content and purpose of that legislation is well known to historians, but here John Phillip Reid places it in the context of eighteenth-century constitutional doctrine and discusses its legality in terms of the intellectual premises of eighteenth-century Anglo-American legal values.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Authority of Law</i> is the last of a four-volume work, preceded by <i>The Authority to Tax, The Authority of Rights,</i> and <i>The Authority to Legislate</i>.&nbsp; In these previous volumes, Reid argued that there would have been no rebellion had taxation been the only constitutional topic of controversy, that issues of rights actually played a larger role in the drafting of state and federal constitutions than they did in instigating a rebellion, and that the American colonists finally took to the battlefield against the British because of statutes that forced Americans to either concede the authority to legislate or leave the empire.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanding on the evidence presented in the first three volumes, <i>The Authority of Law</i> determines the constitutional issues dividing American whigs from British imperialists.&nbsp; Reid summarizes these issues as “the supremacy issue,” “the Glorious Revolution issue,” “the liberty issue,” and the “representation issue.”&nbsp; He then raises a compelling question: why, with so many outstanding lawyers participating in the debate, did no one devise a constitutionally legal way out of the standoff?&nbsp; Reid makes an original suggestion.&nbsp; No constitutional solution was found because the British were&nbsp; more threatened by American legal theory than the Americans were by British theory.&nbsp; British lawyers saw the future of liberty in Great Britain endangered by the American version of constitutional law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considered as a whole, Reid’s <i>Constitutional History of the American Revolution</i> contributes to an understanding of the central role of legal and constitutional standards, especially concern for rule by law, in the development of the American nation.</p>"

Sound and Music for the Theatre The Art and Technique of Design,['Deena Kaye'],"<p>This is the only comprehensive text that discusses the aesthetics of sound design for the stage. It is a practical and comprehensive guide to the field of sound design, covering the designer's relationships within the theatre community and detailing the process of sound design. The focus is on design approaches and techniques, rather than equipment operation.<br><br><br> For every phase of theatrical production, Sound and Music for the Theatre traces the entire process of sound design from initial concept through finished plan. The book discusses the early evolution of a sound design that supports the play. It discusses how to research sources for music and effects, devise a sound plot, and negotiate in a contract. It explains how to plan the gathering and construction of the sound design elements; how the designer operates in a rehearsal; and how to set up and train an operator to run sound equipment for a theatrical production. The instructive information is interspersed with war stories describing real-life problems and solutions that sound designers or composers will be able to apply in similar situations that they may encounter. Also included are two highly informative roundtable discussions with well-respected directors, playwrights, composers and sound designers focusing on sound in the theatre.</p>                        <p><b>Audience:</b> Sound design courses from undergraduate to graduate level.

Churchill’s Bunker: The Cabinet War Rooms and the Culture of Secrecy in Wartime London,['Richard Holmes'],"<p>'This is the room from which I will direct the war,' Churchill declared upon seeing the dank storage basement in an improbably central location near the Houses of Parliament. The chambers would become his base of operations during the heaviest enemy bombardment of London. In <i>Churchillâs Bunker</i><i>,</i> distinguished Churchill biographer Richard Holmes provides the first comprehensive history of the Cabinet War Rooms, from which Churchill managed to turn a seemingly inevitable defeat at the hands of the Nazis into a victory for the free world.</p><p>Here was the Map Room that charted the advances and retreats of armies, the locations of warships, and the often painful progress of the convoys that kept the nation supplied with munitions. Here the planners worked on future operations and the intelligence staff pondered the enemyâs next moves. And remarkably, all of this highly charged work was known only to those who needed to know.</p><p>Drawing on a wealth of original material, including new firsthand accounts of the people who lived and worked there, Holmes reveals how and why the bunker and its war machine developed, how life was conducted in a realm where 'only the clock told whether it was night or day and . . . an electric bell gave warning of an air-raid,' and how Churchill interacted with his staff in very close quarters. A unique exploration of the calculus of secrecy during the Second World War, <i>Churchillâs Bunker</i> provides an intimate portrait of Churchill and his&nbsp;closest advisors in one of the most fascinating and underexplored venues of twentieth-century history.</p>"
The Declining Significance Of Race : Blacks And Changing American Institutions,['William Julius Wilson'],"<p>This new paperback edition includes a major new essay in which William Julius Wilson not only reflects on the debate surrounding his book, but also presents a provocative discussion of race, class, and social policy.</p>
<p>""Wilson has written a profound and provocative book that is destined to become a classic in the field. He has articulated the issues with which future researchers will have to deal. Truly, he has made a contribution to social science.""—Wilson Record, <i>American Journal of Sociology</i></p>
<p>""The intellectual strength of this book lies in his capacity to integrate disparate findings from historical studies, social theory and research on contemporary trends into a complex and original synthesis that challenges widespread assumptions about the cause of black disadvantage and the way to remove it.""—Paul Starr, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p>
<p>This is a short but important book. . . . Wilson presents a cogent and convincing interpretation of how the changing political and economic structure of the United States profoundly affected the position of black Americans.""—Pierre van den Berghe, <i>Sociology and Social Research</i></p>
<p>""This publication is easily one of the most erudite and sober diagnoses of the American black situation. Students of race relations and anybody in a policy-making position cannot afford to bypass this study.""—Ernest Manheim, <i>Sociology</i></p>"
The Unmarried In Later Life:,['Pat Keith'],"<p>This pioneering study examines the resources and well-being of older widowed, divorced or separated, and never-married men and women over time. The first comprehensive, longitudinal study of its kind ever published, <i>The Unmarried in Later Life</i> considers the effects of changes in health, finances, work, social networks, vulnerability, and psychological well-being and compares adaptations to these transitions for unmarried men and women. Because it focuses attention on one of the fastest growing--yet often neglected--segments of the population, this volume is an ideal supplemental text for courses in sociology, gerontology, family studies, and the psychology of aging.</p>
<p>Several features make <i>The Unmarried in Later Life</i> a unique contribution to the social sciences literature: The author considers unmarried categories (widowed, never-married, etc.)_ separately, permitting more extended comparisons between groups; The study is based upon a nationally representative sample and contains data on more unmarried persons than are usually available for study; The use of longitudinal data facilitates the observation of the unmarried over a longer period of time than is often possible; The author offers a detailed evaluation of common assumptions about living alone, challenging widely held negative stereotypes of the unmarried. What emerges is a clear view of the changes in social relationships and their patterns by marital status and gender over the course of a decade. Researchers and practitioners will find here much new information about the social status of the aged unmarried.</p>"
"Making The Grand Figure: Lives And Possessions In Ireland, 1641–1770",['Toby Barnard'],"<p>This pioneering study of the material culture of Stuart and Hanoverian Ireland reveals unsuspected richness and diversity of lifestyle, habitat, and mentality. Like its highly praised predecessor, <i>A New Anatomy of Ireland,</i> it abounds with quirky people and vivid scenes and is a striking reappraisal of Ireland under the Protestant Ascendancy.</p>
<p>The book ranges from the governing elite of Dublin Castle to Dublin itself, to provincial towns and the countryside beyond, and even to the Irish in Britain and Europe. Toby Barnard describes varied buildings, gardens, pictures, and belongings, showing how possessions highlighted and widened divisions between rich and poor, women and men, Irish Catholics and Protestant settlers. The book allows Ireland for the first time to be integrated into discussions of the pleasures and pains of consumerism.</p>"
Hystories: hysterical epidemics and modern media,"['Showalter, Elaine.']","<p>This provocative and illuminating book charts the persistence of a cultural phenomenon. Tales of alien abduction, chronic fatigue syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, and the resurgence of repressed memories in psychotherapy are just a few of the signs that we live in an age of hysterical epidemics.</p>
<p>As Elaine Showalter demonstrates, the triumphs of the therapeutic society have not been able to prevent the appearance of hysterical disorders, imaginary illnesses, rumor panics, and pseudomemories that mark the end of the millenium.</p>
<p>Like the witch-hunts of the 1690s and the hypnotic cures of the 1980s, the hysterical syndromes of the 1990s reflect the fears and anxieties of a culture on the edge of change. Showalter highlights the full range of contemporary syndromes and draws connections to earlier times and settings, showing that hysterias mutate and are renamed; under the right circumstances, everyone is susceptible.</p>
<p>Today, hysterical epidemics are not spread by viruses or vapors but by stories, narratives Showalter calls <b>hystories</b> that are created ""in the interaction of troubled patients and sympathetic therapists... circulated through self-help books, articles in newspapers and magazines, TV talk shows, popular films, the Internet, even literary criticism."" Though popular stereotypes of hysteria are still stigmatizing, largely because of their associations with women, many of the most recent manifestations receive respectful and widespread coverage. In an age skeptical of Freud and the power of unconscious desires and conflicts, personal troubles are blamed on everything from devil-worshipping sadists to conspiring governments. The result is the potential for paranoia and ignorance on a massive scale.</p>
<p>Skillfully surveying the condition of hysteria -- its causes, cures, famous patients, and doctors -- in the twentieth century, Showalter also looks at literature, drama, and feminist representations of the hysterical. Hysterias, she shows, are always with us, a kind of collective coping mechanism for changing times; all that differs are names and labels, and at times of crisis, individual hysterias can become contagious.</p>
<p>Insightful and sensitive, filled with fascinating new perspectives on a culture saturated with syndromes of every sort, <i>Hystories</i> is a gift of good sense from one of our best critics.</p>

"Splitting The Middle: Political Alienation, Acquiescence, And Activism Among America's Middle Layers","['Herring, Cedric.']","<p>This provocative new study explores the reasons for the dramatic decline in confidence which the political institutions of the U.S. have suffered since the 1960s. The author demonstrates the limitations of existing attempts to account for this heightened political alienation, particularly ""spirit of the times"" explanations which claim that events like the Vietnam War and Watergate affected the entire U.S. population in a similar fashion and ""political socialization and culture"" theories which, Herring argues, do not accurately gauge the amount of change that has occurred in the past 25 years. Instead, Herring proposes and tests a ""welfare split"" model which posits that conflicts over spending priorities of the state have led to spiraling alienation among different class fractions. Ideal as supplemental reading for advanced courses in political sociology, political economy, and political science, Splitting the Middle offers important new insights into the nature and causes of political alienation among America's middle layers. After pointing out the polarizing effects of the movements and events since the 1960s, Herring shows that the increasing lack of confidence in political institutions has a class basis. The War on Poverty and the progressive movements of the 1960s and 1970s, he demonstrates, forced irreconcilable demands on government and produced dual tendencies among different classes. On the one hand, levels of political alienation swelled among members of the capitalist, professional-managerial, and traditional working classes as a reaction to protest movement activities, growing deficits and the increasing burdens of the welfare state. At the same time, Herring asserts,political distrust among the new layer of public sector professionals and the poor grew because of cutbacks in government programs and worsening economic conditions. Using data from the National Elections Studies and other sources, Herring shows how the government's oscillation between mutually contradictory sets of demands led to higher levels of political distrust. Finally, Herring analyzes what consequences these higher levels of alienation have had on political behaviors and the society.</p>"

The Civic Potential Of Video Games,"['Kahne, Joseph.']","<p>This report focuses on the civic aspects of video game play among youth. According to a 2006 survey, 58 percent of young people aged 15 to 25 were civically ""disengaged,"" meaning that they participated in fewer than two types of either electoral activities (defined as voting,campaigning, etc.) or civic activities (for example, volunteering). Kahne and his coauthors are interested in what role video games may or may not play in this disengagement.Until now, most research in the field has considered how video games relate to children's aggression and to academic learning. Digital media scholars suggest, however, that other social outcomes also deserve attention. For example, as games become more social, some scholars argue that they can be important spheres in which to foster civic development. Others disagree, suggesting that games, along with other forms of Internet involvement, may in fact take time away from civic and political engagement.Drawing on data from the 2006 survey, the authors examine the relationship between video game play and civic development. They call for further research on teen gaming experiences so that we can understand and promote civic engagement through video games.</p>"
Living and Learning with New Media: Summary of Findings from the Digital Youth Project,"['Mizuko Ito', 'Laura Robinson', 'Heather A. Horst', 'C. J. Pascoe', 'Matteo Bittanti']","<p>This report summarizes the results of an ambitious three-year ethnographic study,funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, into how young people are living and learning with new media in varied settings - at home, in after school programs, and in online spaces. It offers a condensed version of a longer treatment provided in the book Hanging Out,Messing Around, and Geeking Out (MIT Press, 2009). The authors present empirical data on new media in the lives of American youth in order to reflect upon the relationship between new media and learning. In one of the largest qualitative and ethnographic studies of American youth culture, the authors view the relationship of youth and new media not simply in terms of technology trends but situated within the broader structural conditions of childhood and the negotiations with adults that frame the experience of youth in the United States.The book that this report summarizes was written as a collaborative effort by members of the Digital Youth Project, a three-year research effort funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Southern California.John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Reports on Digital Media and Learning</p>"
Preventing A Biological Arms Race (the Mit Press),['Susan Wright'],"<p>This source book presents the essential technical, political, legal, and historical background needed for informed judgments about the recent expansion of military interest in the life sciences - particularly in the weapons potential of the new biotechnology. Preventing a Biological Arms Race develops the case for strengthening national and international commitments to biological disarmament and proposes courses of action to achieve this goal.""In theory,"" Susan Wright observes,""the menace of biological warfare should no longer be with us."" Developing, producing, and stockpiling biological weapons are unconditionally banned by international treaty. East-West military rivalry and confrontations in the Middle East have eroded confidence in the treaty regime,however. The advent of genetic engineering and other new biotechnologies has revived military interest in biological weaponry, generating concern about the potential weapons applications of biological research.The 15 contributions by experts from a wide range of disciplines include a history of U.S. biological warfare policy, analyses of the ethical issues posed by defensive biological warfare research, case studies of alleged violations of the international legal regime prohibiting biological weapons, reviews of that regime, and proposals for strengthening the barriers to biological warfare.

America And The Multinational Corporation: The History Of A Troubled Partnership,"['Reardon, John J. (john Joseph) , 1926-']","<p>This study chronicles the unique relationship between the Federal government and the American multinational corporation, integrating it into the mainstream of American political history. It is a record of continuous adjustment on the part of both parties as each side navigated the unchartered waters of this unconventional partnership. What makes it so relevant historically is that while the Federal government was adjusting to its postwar global responsibilities, corporate America in its multinational dimension was taking on new roles which redefined the international political economy. It involved international oil companies impacting our relations with the volatile Middle East, an economic Watergate of global dimensions, and an unresolved debate on public versus private responsibilities toward the Third World and its multiple economic and social problems. Objectively presented, <i>America and the Multinational Corporation</i> provides the historical context for tracking the various presidential perspectives from Truman to Bush as well as the various congressional initiatives to redefine business-government relations in terms of corporate America's most aggressive offspring--the multinational.</p>
<p>Professor Reardon moves beyond the initial assessments of the multinational corporation vis-a-vis the Federal government, refusing to view it as a threat to the continued survival of the nation-state or as a force that the Federal government must tame at all cost. Rather, the partnership is a complex and continuously evolving relationship that may well be acquiring a new configuration as the world's economy becomes global rather than international. His study will be of interest to all students of contemporary American history as well as scholars in international political economy.</p>"
The Political World Of The Clergy,['Ted G. Jelen'],"<p>This study examines the role of religion in American politics. It begins with the assumption that there exist multiple democratic theories, and that religion has a different role to play in each. It compares consensus theories of American political culture, and dualistic theories of political mobilization, and accounts, which emphasize the diversity of the American citizenry. The question of how religious leaders view their political roles is of the work's focus. The major part of the study consists of interviews with nearly thirty Protestant ministers and Roman Catholic clergy concerning their conceptions of the relationship between the sacred and the political. These conceptions are then related to the various theories of democratic political culture, with the conclusion that each of three traditions (Roman Catholicism, mainline Protestantism, and Evangelical Protestantism) embodies to some extent one of the models of democratic politics.</p>
<p>This work will be of interest to scholars and students of American politics, government, and religion.</p>"
The Superpowers And The Syrian-israeli Conflict: Beyond Crisis Management? (praeger Series In Political Communication (paperback)),['Helena Cobban'],"<p>This study investigates the evolution of the military balance between Israel and Syria between 1978 and 1989 and the effects of the close strategic ties that developed in this period between these states and their respective superpower partners. The fighting in Lebanon in 1982 is closely examined, both because it proved to be a key strategic turning point for Israel and Syria, and because it provided important lessons concerning the interaction of the two superpowers in this area. The study also explores the immunity of this area in the late 1980s to diplomatic efforts that resolved numerous regional conflicts elsewhere in the world, as well as the surprising overall stability in the area in the abscence of effective diplomacy. Cobban identifies lessons that may be relevant in addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict in the 1990s. This book will be essential reading for political scientists, students of military engagements, and others interested in the strained relationship between Israel and Syria.</p>"
"Don Juan And The Point Of Honor: Seduction, Patriarchal Society, And Literary Tradition (penn State Studies In Romance Literatures)",['James Mandrell'],"<p>This study of Don Juan treats literary representations and various critical and theoretical interpretations in order to undertake a systematic examination of the many questions surrounding the character. On the one hand, it might be argued that Don Juan threatens society, since he is supposedly an agent of social anarchy. On the other hand, given his intriguing sexual accomplishments, he could be viewed as a positive expression of life itself. Rather than addressing or answering these question, James Mandrell shows what is at stake in the asking of such questions and, moreover, what is at stake in any and all representations and considerations of Don Juan.</p>
<p>After a discussion of the ways that Don Juan's seductive powers infiltrate and influence the interpretations of texts of which he is a part, Mandrell continues with close readings of key Spanish literary works ranging form the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. All of these works involve interrelated issues as regards Don Juan: the worldly uses and abuses of language; the power of literature to engender and embody other literary texts; seduction and its psychological and social subtexts; and society in relation to Don Juan as well as Don Juan's role in society. Ultimately, these notions are tied into the concept of honor as it works in literature and society. Mandrell concludes with a study of modern adaptations of Don Juan and his story in various theories of culture, society, and economic organizations. In light of these readings, Don Juan emerges as a figure who not only bears specific patriarchal myths but as one who embodies and acts out their meanings.</p>
<p>What emerges is a view of Don Juan as a positive social force in patriarchal society and culture, as well as a force operative at the level of desire as it is made manifest in language. As a result, this study reveals that Don Juan should not be treated as an innocent or outmoded cultural artifact. Instead, he is a character whose story and vicissitudes are still significant in the context of our twentieth-century world.</p>"
Debt Reduction And Development: The Case Of Mexico,['Sudarshn Gooptu'],"<p>This study provides an in-depth analysis of the external debt problem of a country--Mexico--that allegedly faces a debt overhang, which inhibits long-term growth-oriented investment. Issues facing the debtor nation and its commercial bank creditors are simultaneously examined in order to move closer towards an understanding of the situation of debt-distressed developing countries. The need to address these issues on a case-by-case basis is emphasized, opposed to a global approach to solving the debt crisis presently recommended by some.</p>
<p>Not only does this work provide a survey of the theoretical literature on the international debt crisis it also provides a way of incorporating simultaneously the concerns of the opposing sides--debtor nations and creditor banks. It will be of interest to economists and policy-makers in international finance and trade and development economics.</p>"
The Myths Of Love: Classical Lovers In Medieval Literature,['Katherine Heinrichs'],"<p>This study seeks to define the medieval literary conventions governing allusions to certain Ovidian and Virgilian tales of love in the works of Boccaccio, Machaut, Froissart, and Chaucer. Using evidence from the Latin mythographers, it addresses several much-debated critical issues in medieval scholarship: questions of narrative voice, thematic unity, and purpose. Its principal contribution is to the discussion and evaluation of the French and Italian poems of love to which Chaucer was most heavily indebted. The author suggests that the love poems of Boccaccio, Machaut, and Froissart, rather than being ponderous didactic productions designed to instruct medieval audiences in the art of love, are true progeny of the <em>Roman de la Rose</em>,complex <em>jeux d'esprit</em> much closer in spirit and intention to the works of Chaucer than has been supposed.</p>"
International Trade - 2nd Edition: Selected Readings,"['Bhagwati', 'Jagdish N.']","<p>This text collects the most important contributions to the theory of international trade in recent decades, including the many new approaches developed during the 1980s. Of the 28chapters in major sections covering general equilibrium, trade pattern theories, imperfect competition and market structure, quotas and VERs, theory of distortions, direct unproductive profit-seeking and rent-seeking activities, customs unions, growth and transfers, and foreign investment, 16 are new to this edition.These new pieces focus on such currently active areas as the treatment of market structure, explored chiefly by economists Avinash Dixit, Jonathan Eaton and Gene M. Grossman, Paul R. Krugman, Elhanan Helpman, James Brander and Barbara Spencer, and imperfect competition and the theory of political economy, with key contributions by Anne 0. Krueger, Jagdish Bhagwati, Ronald Findlay, T. N. Srinivasan, Richard Brecher, Wolfgang Mayer, and several other younger trade theorists.Other new selections take up developments within more traditional topics,such as the classic problem of the effects of transfers, the equivalence of tariffs and quotas,revived in the context of the effect of VERs, and the theory of multinational investments which has been affected by both the new theories of market structure and of political economy.Jagdish N.</p>

"Ezra Pound: The Tragic Years, 1925-1972","['Wilhelm, James J.']","<p>This third and final volume of Wilhelm's life of Ezra Pound commences with Pound's departure from Paris at the height of his writing career for Italy, where he hoped to find a quieter life, and it takes him to his death in 1972. It tells of Pound's foolish support of the fascists during World War II and his subsequent incarceration by the Allies in a camp where he wrote some of his finest poetry, <em>The Pisan Cantos</em>. Wilhelm chronicles Pound's escape from being tried for treason on the grounds of insanity only to be remanded o St. Elizabeths Hospital for twelve years. Pound ultimately returned to Italy, where he died in 1972.</p>
<p>Part of Wilhelm's strength as a biographer is his deep immersion in Pound's poetry and prose, as well as his knowledge of the complexities of the publishing history of Pound's work. Wilhelm quotes extensively from Pound's poetry, with many illuminating comments on the biographical background on the <em>Cantos</em>. He also discusses Pound's influence on an entire generation of poets ranging from Robert Lowell to Allen Ginsberg.</p>"

Power Of A Third Kind: The Western Attempt To Colonize The Global Village,"['Nazer, Hisham M. , 1932-']","<p>This thought-provoking book points out that the most significant change in international relations in the 20th century was not the defeat of communism, nor the end of the Cold War, but the huge advances in communications technologies. Hisham Nazer, a leading Saudi Arabian intellectual and petroleum industry leader, argues that the West has used its control over these capabilities to superimpose its cultural and political values on the rest of the world. CNN, films and television, and the Internet have become the means of promoting Western products—including soft drinks, detergents, and even the ideals of democracy and human rights—in relatively powerless non-Western nations. This process of creating a global culture through the propagation of Western political and philosophical constructs as world brands poses grave dangers for the entire international community. As countries become aware of their exploitation, the possibilities for frustration and violence become increasingly real.</p>
<p><i>Power of a Third Kind</i> is directed toward Western and non-Western leaders alike. For the former, it provides a new perspective from outside the mirror of our Western culture, pointing out that current practices are actually endangering the security of our hemisphere. The author calls on Western leaders to work on a dialogue with other societies as an alternative to exporting to them a monologue designed for passive absorption. And for the latter, this book will inspire them to steer out of their current course in time to protect their histories and the integrity of their cultures. Through meaningful dialogue, well-meaning nations will find a way for the most beneficial aspects of Western culture—self-rule and basic human rights—to evolve within the context of local cultures, resulting in a world both more stable and more humane.</p>"

Assessment And Treatment Of Addictive Disorders,"['Timothy B. Baker', 'Dale S. Cannon']","<p>This volume analyzes selected state-of-the-art addiction research presently being conducted by leaders in the field. It critically evaluates the assessment and treatment strategies that are used in addiction research. The contributors to Part I address the assessment of addictive disorders, covering issues such as self-monitoring; social/family interaction patterns, self-efficacy and relapse determinants, and drinking patterns over time. In Part II, the treatment section, they examine aversion therapy for both cigarette smokers and alcoholics, coping-response counseling, the effectiveness of relapse prevention, and a job-training program for heroin addicts.</p>"
Trauma And Rebirth: Intergenerational Effects Of The Holocaust,"['Sigal, John J.']","<p>This volume examines the long-term consequences of the Holocaust on survivors and their children some four decades after the war. This book represents the culmination of nine years of collaborative effort, consisting primarily of findings drawn from two sample surveys of Jewish residents in Montreal. This volume covers new research topics that have been neglected in the survivor literature, including personality, familial interactions, vocational achievements, sociopolitical attitudes. an excellent source of material from a sociopolitical and psychological perspective. The assessment of the impact of a political movement on the attitudes and psychological status of a minority population is informative. The study of a large group of Holocaust survivors adds significantly to the scientific literature in this area. <i>Contemporary Psychology</i></p>
<p>The first empirical study of the psychological consequences of the Holocaust across three generations, this book assesses the long-term and intergenerational effects of severe victimization and of other forms of exposure to excessive, prolonged stress. Although there can be no doubt that there are negative psychological and physical consequences for the survivors of the Holocaust, the authors present evidence here that contradicts the dominant thrust of previous studies, which emphasized dysfunction in the family life of survivors and psychological impairment in their children. In addition to an intensive study of Holocaust survivors and their families, this book provides a yardstick against which the long-term and cross-generational impact of other potentially traumatic situations--war, earthquakes, flood, fire, assault, and so on--may be measured.</p>
<p>The authors' research for this volume spans the disciplines of psychology, psychiatry, sociology, history, and ethnic studies. The book, however, is written in an accessible style easily understood by the nonprofessional reader. The culmination of a nine year collaborative effort, <i>Trauma and Rebirth</i> consists, primarily, of findings drawn from two sample surveys of Jewish residents in Montreal. One survey focuses on Holocaust survivors, the second on children of survivors. Both include control groups, and draw from unbiased, nonclinical, and non-self-selected populations. Students and scholars of modern Jewish life and the Holocaust, or anyone interested in the study of trauma and victimization, will find <i>Trauma and Rebirth</i> an invaluable resource.</p>"
Peru: The Evolution Of A Crisis (politics In Latin America),['James Rudolph'],"<p>This volume gives specialists and students alike a comprehensive political history of Peru that includes the first full-length treatment of the 1980s, a decade in which early optimism sparked by the return of democratic rule gave way to widespread pessimism amidst a full-blown social, economic, and political crisis. Discussed are Peru's return to democracy in the 1980s and the multiple challenges that process has faced. The study traces the growth of the Sendero Luminoso insurgency; the economic collapse that brought Peru hyperinflation coupled with its deepest depression of the twentieth century; and the evolution of the electoral political system that brought Alberto Fujimori, a political novice, to the presidency in 1990.</p>
<p>Many of the key causes of Peru's contemporary crisis--foreign debt, fiscal irresponsibility, desgobierno (erratic, inappropriate, or incompetent behavior on the part of the government), and the centralization of governmental authority--have been recurrent themes in Peruvian history since at least the early republican period. The profound social divisions within Peru's population, which constitute the principal cause of la crisis, have persisted even longer. A number of these divisions have broken down, however; in this development, the author sees cause for optimism in the midst of crisis. Latin American specialists, Peru watchers, advanced students in comparative politics, journalists, and anyone interested in the far-reaching changes occurring in Latin America will find this book useful and compelling.</p>"
The Economic Transformation Of Eastern Europe: Views From Within,['Bernard S. Katz'],"<p>This volume provides an up-to-date account of how the process of economic transition in Eastern Europe is unfolding from the point of view of Eastern European economists assessing their native economies. The authors have personally experienced the frustrations of the previous Stalinist system of central planning and public ownership, as well as the difficulties and pitfalls of designing new systems based on markets and private ownership. The book focuses on the three countries of Eastern Europe leading the reform efforts--Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland--and points out similarities and differences in their reform strategies.</p>
<p>Although the stories of economic change in Eastern Europe have dominated news headlines, the real challenges of designing and maintaining viable economies are just beginning. The analysis in this volume will be of interest to those in the academic and policy-making communities.</p>"

Amazon To Zami: Towards A Global Lesbian Feminism (sexual Politics),['Monika Reinfelder'],"<p>This work explores the existence of a global network of lesbian activists in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Individual chapters place lesbian concerns in the context of national politics and prevailing attitudes toward women and sexuality, in countries as culturally, politically and economically diverse as Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Argentina. A wide range of women debate their ability to be politically active and openly lesbian in countries that are (at best) hostile to the issues of homosexuality and feminism.</p>"
Cast-off Youth: Policy And Training Methods From The Military Experience,"['Thomas G. Sticht', 'William  B. Armstrong', 'Daniel Hickey']","<p>This work focuses on the highly controversial Project 100,000 which was initiated in the midst of the Vietnam War and the War on Poverty during the Johnson administration. With the project as a model, the authors easily show exactly how the military examined, selected, classified, trained, and utilized the one third of our nation generally considered untrainable and unemployable. In addition to providing detailed statistics on the performance of lower aptitude youth in the military for the last half-century, this work analyzes experiments conducted by the armed forces to develop effective and efficient ways to train these youths.</p>"
"Women's Movements In America: Their Successes, Disappointments, And Aspirations","['Gloria Helen Danziger-signer', 'Rita J. Simon']","<p>This work is a survey of the efforts through which women have changed their place in American society from the nation's founding to the present. Examining the historical struggle for suffrage, legal and property rights, and rights in the work place, the authors show how these experiences have shaped a contemporary movement for economic, political, and social equality that has become increasingly independent and less and less likely to place women's issues second to other national concerns.</p>
<p>The authors recount a history of women activists who repeatedly set aside their own issues in favor of others that seemed more pressing--from abolition and preserving the Union, to labor solidarity in the 1920s, and civil rights and the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s. Male domination of these movements and a lack of support for women's issues have been major factors in creating the contemporary feminist philosophy of going it alone. The book is divided into three topical sections, each of which offers a historical analysis and draws on a variety of sources such as legal statutes and judicial decisions, demographic information, public opinion polls, and biographies and other narrative accounts. It is a richly documented resource for courses and research in women's studies, sociology, politics, and U.S. legal and political history.</p>"
Families And Mental Illness: New Directions In Professional Practice,['Diane Marsh'],"<p>This work is the most comprehensive volume to focus on new directions in professional practice with families of people with mental illness. It offers a multidisciplinary systems-oriented examination of theory, research, and practice in the area. Unique features include a consideration of life-span and family system and subsystem perspectives, as well as the inclusion of powerful personal accounts of family members. It is written from the perspective of a competence paradigm for clinical practice, which offers a constructive alternative to the more prevalent pathology models of the past.</p>
<p>This work is the most comprehensive volume to focus on new directions in professional practice with families of people with mental illness. It offers a multidisciplinary systems-oriented examination of theory, research, and practice in the area. Unique features include a consideration of life-span and family system and subsystem perspectives, as well as the inclusion of powerful personal accounts of family members. It is written from the perspective of a competence paradigm for clinical practice, which offers a constructive alternative to the more prevalent pathology models of the past. In the era following deinstitutionalization, families often have served as an extension of the mental health system. There is much evidence that the needs of families are often poorly met. In response to the shortcomings of the system and to their own anguish, families have become increasingly assertive in articulating their needs for respect, support, information, skills, resources, and services. This volume is designed to provide professionals with increased understanding of the experiences and needs of families, as well as with concrete suggestions for enhancing their effectiveness in meeting those needs.</p>
<p>The first three chapters are designed to explore general issues related to the family experience and family-professional relationships, the conceptual and empirical context, and new directions in professional practice. The next six chapters provide the experiential core of the volume, covering such topics as life-span perspectives, the subjective and objective burden, the family system, family subsystems, coping and adaptation, and the needs of families. The final three chapters are concerned with intervention, including nonclinical strategies that are designed primarily to educate and support families, and clinical strategies that are designed primarily to provide treatment. The nonclinical and clinical intervention strategies that are discussed have the potential to comprise a full continuum of family-oriented services that can be tailored to the needs, desires, and resources of particular families. The final chapter is concerned with intervention on the level of the mental health system.</p>"
American Policy And Northern Ireland: A Saga Of Peacebuilding,['Joseph E. Thompson'],"<p>Thompson examines the U.S. role--both governmental and that of Irish-Americans--in attempting to bring a resolution to the strife in Northern Ireland. He concentrates on the efforts since 1967, particularly the growth of American efforts to become the central humanitarian player in the peace process.</p>
<p>The U.S. government stance was initially one of strict non-involvement. However, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, diminished White House authority encouraged Irish-American groups to challenge the traditional Irish policy. Movement away from strict non-involvement began with Congressional concern for the rising specter of Irish-American anger at the treatment of northern Irish Catholics. An important transition to humanitarian policy occurred during the Reagan Administration. Contributing factors that helped the U.S. government take a new direction in foreign policy were America's failure to respond to the escalation of Northern Ireland violence, a strong personal ethnic tie between the U.S. President and Speaker of the House O'Neill, a personal link between President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, and intense lobbying by Irish-Americans and the Irish government. After a brief period of silent diplomacy during the Bush administration, the Clinton administration succeeded in a public blitz to endorse steps necessary to bring peace closer.</p>"

Communazis: Fbi Surveillance Of German Emigré Writers,['Alexander Stephan'],"<p>Thousands of writers, artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals fled Germany in the 1930s. Many settled in the United States, hoping to find allies against Nazism and a safe refuge from Hitler’s Gestapo. But in America nearly all of the exiled authors—among them Nobel Prize recipient Thomas Mann, his brother Heinrich, dramatist Bertolt Brecht, and novelists Erich Remarque and Lion Feuchtwanger—became the subjects of intense suspicion and government surveillance. This riveting book, based on secret FBI files released for the first time to Alexander Stephan under the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts, reveals the disturbing details and the surprising extent of government surveillance operations conducted against German exiles during World War II and the McCarthy era.</p>
<p>Not only the FBI but also the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the House Un-American Activities Committee, and other agencies spied on the German émigrés. Wiretaps were installed, mail was routinely opened and read, records of visitors were maintained. Searches—not always with legal warrants—were conducted, informants hired, and connections to exile writers established (Thomas Mann’s daughter, Erika, volunteered her insights). Stephan sets these activities in historical context and discusses the widespread xenophobia and paranoia that surrounded Nazism and Communism, which were frequently conflated in the public imagination. The author illuminates the relationship not only between German anti-Nazis and U.S. politics of the period but also between intellectuals and the modern surveillance state.</p>"
J. Edgar Hoover And His G-men,['William B. Breuer'],"<p>Through gripping accounts of actual incidents, William Breuer brings the reader to the front lines of battle with Hoover and his crimebusters. Thrilling manhunts, thwarted mayhem, and tense confrontations dominate the action as the FBI tracks down the most dangerous hoodlums, kidnappers, and marauders of the era. Breuer also examines the social obstacles of pursuing justice during that bleak period in American history. Citizen apathy spurred by the Depression further stacked the odds against the G-Men as they chased desperadoes across the landscape. Somehow, the FBI achieved unprecedented success in the face of almost insurmountable odds. This powerful volume demonstrates the stunning evolution of a tattered, corrupt organization into a disciplined unit priding itself on integrity and a tireless dedication to duty. Most of all, Hoover's mystique and the sheer force of his will can be felt with each encounter detailed in this fascinating book.</p>
<p>As the blood of criminal violence flowed through the streets in early 1920s America, the FBI was rendered helpless by unholy alliances with crooked politicians and shady dealings. A dynamic, young J. Edgar Hoover would change all that. After being named director of the FBI, Hoover quickly whipped the bureau into crime-fighting shape through mass firings of political hacks and painstaking screening of new recruits. Hoover's meticulous revitalization of the FBI resulted in the forming of a small, coldly efficient force that eagerly awaited its chance to battle the criminal element. Once Congress removed limitations on making arrests and carrying firearms, Hoover and 600 G-Men took to the streets, matching guns and wits with America's most notorious gangsters in an all-out war. The G-Men rapidly nailed ruthless criminals and well-known kingpins such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Ma Barker and her sons, Machine Gun Kelly, and Creepy Karpis (who was personally apprehended by Hoover).</p>

Schumpeter And The Political Economy Of Change,['David L. Mckee'],"<p>Throughout this century, economics as a discipline has not always been distinguished by its insightful treatment of temporal and spatial considerations. The exponents of neoclassical synthesis have often been criticized for failing to incorporate the dimension of time into their machinations, and while the concept of space has fared somewhat better, it still suffers from semantic debate. Structural and/or sectoral considerations have also been lacking, either encumbered by polemics or confounded by the inherited simplicities of the stage theorists. This work, which applies the analytical system of Joseph Schumpeter to spatial and structural dimensions, attempts to explain the role played by change in profit-seeking economies.</p>
<p>Following an introductory chapter that offers a brief description of the Schumpeterian dialectic and its explanation of how change occurs over time under capitalism, the book is divided into three main secions. The first addresses spatial considerations, covering ways in which Schumpeter's analysis can be applied to local and regional contexts in advanced economies; the dialectic in international economic processes, particularly the effect of multinational businesses on individual economies; and development prospects for Third World nations. Section two focuses on the structural dimension, specifically the emergence of service industries and Schumpeter's fears for the survival of capitalism. A hybrid overview of pole theory is also included. The final section offers reflections and a summary, and includes an assessment of the role of government in aiding or impeding change and an illustration of what governments can and cannot do to change their economies in the face of automatic capitalistic processes. This work will be a valuable reference source for courses in economic theory, economic policy, and political science as well as a useful addition to college, university, and public libraries.</p>"
Randall Jarrell On W.h. Auden,"['Jarrell, Randall , 1914-1965']","<p>''To read Randall Jarrell on W. H. Auden is to read the best-equipped of American critics of poetry of the past century on the best-equipped of its Anglo-American poets, and we rush to read, perhaps, less out of an academic interest in fair judgment than out of a spectator's love of virtuosity in flight.'' From Adam Gopnik's foreword</p>
<p>Randall Jarrell was one of the most important poet-critics of the past century, and the poet who most fascinated and infuriated him was W. H. Auden. In Auden, Jarrell found a crucial poetic influence that needed to be both embraced and resisted. During the 1940s, Jarrell wrestled with Auden's work, writing a series of notorious articles on Auden that remain admired and controversial examples of devoted and contentious criticism. While Jarrell never completed his proposed book on Auden, these previously unpublished lectures revise and reprise his earlier articles and present new insights into Auden's work. Delivered at Princeton University in 1951 and 1952, Jarrell's lectures reflect a passionate appreciation of Auden's work, a witty attack from an informed opponent, and an important document of a major poet's reception.</p>
<p>Jarrell's lectures offer readings of many of Auden's works, including all of his long poems, and illuminate his singular use of a variety of stylistic registers and poetic genres. In the lecture based on the article ''Freud to Paul,'' Jarrell traces the ideas and ideologies that animated and, at times, overwhelmed Auden's poetry. More precisely, he considers the influence of left-liberal politics, psychoanalytic and evolutionary theory, and the idiosyncratic Christian theology that characterized Auden's poems of the 1940s.</p>
<p>While an admiring and sympathetic reader, Jarrell does not avoid identifying Auden's poetic failures and political excesses. He offers occasionally blistering assessments of individual poems and laments Auden's turn from a cryptic, feeling, impassioned poet to a rhetorical, self-conscious one. Stephen Burt's introduction provides a backdrop to the lectures and their reception and importance for the history of modern poetry.</p>

Solomon: The Lure Of Wisdom,"['Weitzman, Steven , 1965-']","<p>Tradition has it that King Solomon knew everything there was to know—the mysteries of nature, of love, of God himself—but what do we know of him? Esteemed biblical scholar Steven Weitzman reintroduces readers to Solomon's story and its surprising influence in shaping Western culture, and he also examines what Solomon's life, wisdom, and writings have come to mean for Jews, Christians, and Muslims over the past two thousand years.</p>
<p>Weitzman's <i>Solomon</i> is populated by a colorful cast of ambitious characters—Byzantine emperors, explorers, rabbis, saints, scientists, poets, archaeologists, trial judges, reggae singers, and moviemakers among them—whose common goal is to unearth the truth about Solomon's life and wisdom. Filled with the Solomonic texts of the Bible, along with lesser–known magical texts and other writings, this book challenges both religious and secular assumptions. Even as it seeks to tell the story of ancient Israel's greatest ruler, this insightful book is also a meditation on the Solomonic desire to know all of life's secrets, and on the role of this desire in world history.</p>"

Transracial Adoptees And Their Families: A Study Of Identity And Commitment,"['Simon, Rita James.']","<p>Transracial adoption is a controversial area of research and practice in child welfare. The authors, a sociologist and a social worker, have contributed much to its understanding through a series of studies that began in 1972 of white families that have adopted nonwhite (mostly black) children. This book reports on the latest phase of their research, which was based on interviews with most of the families and adoptees in the original sample. The purpose of the interviews was to explore the adoptees' racial identities and self-esteem, and the long-term effects of transracial adoption on the adoptees and their families. The authors present their findings in a clear, vivid, and coherent manner; objectively examine the issues raised by the study; and thoughtfully formulate implications for policy and practice. The study supports their major conclusion that 'where no appropriate permanent inracial placement can be found for a non-white child . . . transracial adoption should be seriously considered.' A timely, unique, and sophisticated work that should be read widely by students, practitioners, and policymakers in child welfare. <i>Choice</i></p>
<p>Reporting on the third phase of a 14-year study of transracial adoption, this volume focuses on the adoption of non-white children by white families. It includes personal interviews with 96 mothers and fathers and 218 children which help to answer questions about the long-term effects of transracial adoption on the adoptees' mental and emotional health and their racial identities. These valuable empirical data are combined with discussions of the practices of adoption agencies, recent court rulings, and alternative forms of adoption.</p>"
Burden Of Dreams: History And Identity In Post-soviet Ukraine (post-communist Cultural Studies),['Catherine Wanner'],"<p>Ukraine is the largest new state to appear on the map of Europe this century. With a population of more than 50 million people and a territory larger than France, the new Ukrainian state faces many challenges, not least of which is to forge a national identity after years of Soviet rule. <em>Burden of Dreams</em> examines daily life in Soviet and post-Soviet Ukraine, showing why Ukrainian nationalism and its program of ""Ukrainianization"" have appealed to the largest Russian diaspora and to millions of Russified Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Focusing on schools, festivals, commemorative ceremonies, and monuments, Catherine Wanner shows how Soviet-created narratives have been recast to reflect a post-Soviet Ukrainocentric perspective. In the process, we see how new histories are understood and acted upon. This reveals regional cleavages and the resilience of cultural differences produced by the Soviet regime.

Finding The Best Business School For You: Looking Past The Rankings,"['Everette E. Dennis', 'Sharon P. Smith']","<p>Ultimately, finding the best and most appropriate business school requires more than following trends and assessing rankings. Dennis and Smith offer an approach that is designed to help prospective MBA students cast their nets widely, thinking more expansively, creatively, and strategically, with both short- and long-term implications in mind. Discussing the pros and cons of a formal business education (in the context of evolving attitudes toward management and the role of the MBA in developing successful leaders), the authors help readers identify their underlying motivations for pursuing an MBA, learn how to read between the lines of the popular rankings, and utilize the concept of return on investment (ROI) to evaluate programs on the basis of their contribution to long-term professional and personal goals. At a time when one-fourth of all master's degrees conferred are in business, <i>Finding the Best Business School for You</i> offers practical insights for making wise decisions and getting the most out of the MBA experience.</p>
<p>The truth is that, in response to changes in the global business environment, many schools are redesigning their curricula, forging closer ties with businesses, and giving students more freedom to customize their degrees. Some of the most innovative programs are being designed at public universities and other institutions out of the spotlight.</p>"
Degrees That Matter: Climate Change And The University,"['Rappaport, Ann.']","<p>Universities and colleges are in a unique position to take a leadership role on global warming. As communities, they can strategize and organize effective action. As laboratories for learning and centers of research, they can reduce their own emissions of greenhouse gases,educate students about global warming, and direct scholarly attention to issues related to climate change and energy. Degrees That Matter offers practical guidance for those who want to harness the power of universities and other institutions, and provides perspectives on how to motivate change and inspire action within complex organizations.The authors, drawing on almost a decade of experience leading the Tufts Climate Initiative and other institutional ""greening"" efforts, provide both the basic facts and more detailed information about climate issues. Some chapters can be used as stand-alone action guides for specific areas, while others put climate action in scientific,economic, and political contexts. The authors discuss the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions on campus and the importance of an emissions inventory for setting goals and strategies. They consider decision making (and decision makers), costs, budgets, and institutional priorities, and describe different emission reduction projects. They look at the importance of master planning for the university and the value of action by individual community members. Finally, they suggest climate action projects for the classroom and offer guidance for tapping student energy. Their aim is to inspire others to take on global warming regardless of organizational setting.</p>"
"Greening The Ivory Tower: Improving The Environmental Track Record Of Universities, Colleges, And Other Institutions (urban And Industrial Environments)",['Sarah Creighton'],"<p>Universities can teach and demonstrate environmental principles and stewardship by taking action to understand and reduce the environmental impacts of their own activities. Greening the Ivory Tower, a motivational and how-to guide for staff, faculty, and students, offers detailed""greening"" strategies for those who may have little experience with institutional change or with the latest environmentally friendly technologies.The author was project manager of Tufts CLEAN!, a program whose mission was to reduce Tufts University's environmental impact. After analyzing the campus's overall environmental impact (each year the main campus serves 5 million meals; makes 14million photocopies; uses 65 tons of paper towels, 110 million gallons of water, and 23 million kWh of electricity; and generates over 2,000 tons of solid waste), the team decided to focus on food waste, transportation, energy efficiency, and procurement practices. An essential discovery was that to change practices requires the personal commitment and direct involvement of those who have the responsibility for operating the institution on a daily basis. Although the Tufts experience forms the basis for many of the proposals in the book, the story goes well beyond Tufts; the author includes examples of successful practices from many other institutions.</p>"

"From Megaphones To Microphones: Speeches Of American Women, 1920-1960","['Sarkela, Sandra J.', 'Ross, Susan Mallon', 'Lowe, Margaret A.']","<p>Until recently, scholars assumed that women stopped speaking after they won the vote in 1920 and did not reenter political life until the second wave of feminism began in the 1960s. Nothing could be further from the truth. While national attention did dissipate after 1920, women did not retreat from political and civic life. Rather, after winning the vote, women's public activism shifted from a single-issue agenda to the myriad social problems and public issues that faced the nation.

"Women At Work: The Transformation Of Work And Community In Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860",['Thomas Dublin'],"<p>Until the nineteenth century, women were largely confined to work in the home. But in the years between 1820 and 1860 the rise of the cotton textile industry in New England radically altered women's working and living patterns. Thousands of single, young women left the homes of their parents to work in the growing mill towns and to live together in the company boardinghouses. This was the first generation of American women to face the demands of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p><i>Women at Work</i>details the lives of this first generation in Lowell, Massachusetts -- America's leading factory town in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. The mill experience bridged the gap between rural and urban life, as Yankee women from the countryside brought to the mill towns the rich kinship and friendship networks indigenous to preindustrial America. Thomas Dublin shows how these rural values, transplanted to Lowell's factories and boardinghouses, contributed to the emergence of a close-knit community of women workers.</p>
<p>Recounting the birth of the American textile industry and the rise of Lowell, Dublin analyzes the social relations in the early mills, the boardinghouse community, the strikes of the 1830s, and the Ten Hour Movement organized for the reduction of hours in the 1840s. He then describes the influx of Irish and other immigrant workers who displaced the Yankee women workers and brought about the transformation of the community. The immigrant workers lived in private tenements rather than in the company boardinghouses, a family labor system replaced one consisting primarily of young, single women, and more stringent working conditions and wage cuts undermined the previousstandards. The unprecedented first period of the American women's labor movement had passed.</p>


                        <p>Women at Work tells of the first generation of women to enter industrial employment by recounting experiences of workers in the cotton mills of mid-19th century Lowell, Massachusetts.

The House Of Atreus: Abortion As A Human Rights Issue,"['Bohan, James F. , 1964-']","<p>Using clear language and unconventional examples, this book argues that abortion is not merely a medical or religious issue, but one that goes to the very heart of our conception of human rights. It explains that the unborn are living and human beings, that all human beings have a right to life, and that denying the right to life of some weakens the right to life of all. Bohan supports his thesis by pointing to human rights treaties, the Declaration of Independence, and the words of such luminaries as Albert Schweitzer, Frederick Douglass, Pearl S. Buck, Elie Wiesel, and Martin Luther King Jr. He also examines the connection between abortion and the recent push to legalize assisted suicide and euthanasia. Bohan explains why the Greek myth of the House of Atreus is an apt metaphor for our abortion-minded society that shows the distinction between abortion and infanticide is arbitrary. While the Supreme Court holds that the 14th Amendment does not protect the lives of fetuses, at the time the Amendment was drafted, American scholars were comparing the mental capacity of Black people to that of a white fetus. Bohan also explores the the common aspects involved in the destruction of the unborn and the destruction of Jews by the Nazis: the roles of dehumanization, euphemism, the medical community, science, idealism, and humane killing, among others.</p>"

 between religion and social welfare. Arising out of the Indianapolis Polis Center's<br>
 Lilly-sponsored study of religion and urban culture, the book looks at three issues:<br>
 the role of religious social services within Indianapolis's larger social welfare<br>
 support system, both public and private; the evolution of the relationship between<br>
 public and private welfare sectors; and how ideas about citizenship mediated the<br>
 delivery of social services. Noting that religious nonprofits do not figure<br>
 prominently in most studies of welfare, Mapes explores the historical roots of the<br>
 relationship between religiously affiliated social welfare and public agencies. Her<br>
 approach recognizes that local variation has been a defining feature of American<br>
 social welfare. A Public Charity aims to illuminate local trends and to relate the<br>
 situation in Indianapolis to national trends and events.</p>

"Pius Xii, The Holocaust, And The Cold War",['Michael Phayer'],"<p>Using newly available material from the U.S. National Archives, Michael Phayer sheds new light on the actions of the Vatican and of the man whom some have mistakenly called ""Hitler's Pope."" As a new world war loomed, the Vatican believed it had to make a choice between communism and Nazism. Reluctantly, both Pius XII and his predecessor chose the Nazis as the lesser of two evils. In the balance rested the genocide of European Jews. As difficult as his wartime behavior is to accept, perhaps nothing demonstrates Pius's fear of communism more than his misguided and unethical attempt to thwart its growth in South America by abetting the escape of Nazis and Ustaši war criminals. The story of these Vatican ""ratlines"" adds another facet to the complex picture of Pius XII and the Holocaust.</p>"
Soviet Aims In Central America: The Case Of Nicaragua,['Gregory W. Sand'],"<p>Using Nicaragua as a case study, this book demonstrates how Soviet foreign policy has been the instrument for projecting Moscow's power and influence in a region that has been in the U.S. sphere of influences since 1898. Soviet Aims in Central America lays down the facts about the Soviets' drive since the 1950s to undermine U.S. influence in Central America by fueling guerrilla wars. G. W. Sand examines key Sandinista, Castroite, and Guatemalan Communist documents and reveals how Soviet military power is being used by the Sandinistas and their Cuban allies to consolidate power, threaten Nicaragua's neighbors, and ultimately revolutionize all of Central America. This, Sand claims, threatens the future of the United States itself.</p>
<p>The foreword by former ambassador to Costa Rica, Lewis A. Tambs, chillingly describes the unprecedented threat to U.S. security by Soviet satellization of Central American countries. Sand begins the book with a detailed review of Soviet aims and strategies in the Americas. The book offers a history of the Sandinista movement as well as Soviet foreign policy toward Nicaragua. Further chapters explore the Sandinistas' record with regard to human rights and the current civil war in Nicaragua. Sand's detailed reading of Central American Communist documents reveals Soviet aims for the region. Finally, the book offers a possible strategy for averting Moscow's incursion into the United States' sphere of influence. Students of political science and scholars of Central America, or anyone interested in this volatile region, will find Soviet Aims in Central America provocative reading.</p>"

Visual Effects Cinematography,['Zoran Perisic'],"<p>Visual effects are an important aspect of film creation, with new technologies and techniques being developed every day. Nevertheless, many of the effects we see on screen are not computer generated; they are done inside the camera or with projection, techniques that have been around for many years. Visual Effects Cinematography examines both traditional and modern visual effects techniques, illustrating how the new techniques have built upon the old in a way that is especially valuable to students. This book examines in detail the various types of equipment used and how they work, and then goes on to discuss the process of planning the shoot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The most important aspect of visual effects cinematography is the creative problem-solving that happens early in the production, to select the technique that will provide a particular effect and plan the shooting to accommodate the needs of specific scenes. Written by an effects director associated with such blockbuster films as Superman and 2001: A Space Odyssey, this book analyzes the most effective approach to a variety of visual effects problems, detailing the various options available to the filmmaker. Script breakdown, the use of storyboards, and shot planning are covered as part of this creative planning process.<br>
<br>
Topics covered in this book include: elements that make up the visual effects shot; methods of compositing visual effects elements; types of mattes and methods of generating them; visual effects tools and planning; types of cameras and their corresponding in-camera effects; projectors and projection<br>
<br>
Over 100 illustrations support the technical information contained within these pages. Students, cinematographers, and directors will gain valuable insight into the art and process of visual</p>

Gene Future: The Promise And Perils Of The New Biology,['Thomas F. Lee'],"<p>We are poised at the doorway to a future which could surpass the Industrial Revolution in its impact on the world. We are beginning to scrutinize genes in order to read the very history of evolution, and to alter plants and animals in ways undreamed of only a few years ago. As the tools of science have become more sophisticated, scientists have been able to delve deeply into the inner recesses of cells. The fruit of their labor, the new biology, promises us an unprecedented understanding of genes, offering an illuminating view into the most intimate operations of living things from microbes to humans - and with that, the potential to gain increasing control over life itself. Our gene future will soon present us with a cornucopia of products by drawing upon a variety of organisms - plants, animals, and even human cells - that will influence the lives and health of us all. As Thomas Lee, a biologist and author of the acclaimed The Human Genome Project: Cracking the Genetic Code of Life, so vividly shows, the new biology is already beginning to make its mark on our lives. Every week newspapers announce that scientists have found the gene for a disease such as cystic fibrosis or a particular form of cancer, or have seized on a gene therapy to try to combat it. The controversy over using DNA fingerprinting as admissible evidence in court has sparked public concern. The injecting of experimental genes into humans and animals has triggered recent debates. Soon genetically engineered tomatoes and other ""transgenic"" vegetables will be available on the shelves of our local grocers. As Lee so wisely and eloquently cautions, there may be perils along this pathway as well as miraculous discoveries. Do dangers lurk in this new technological approach to nature? May we unwittingly be doing irreparable harm to individuals, not to mention the biosphere? This perceptive author even-handedly assesses the controversies surrounding the perils that may await us as molecular science m</p>

Babies By Design: The Ethics Of Genetic Choice,['Ronald M. Green'],"<p>We stand on the brink of unprecedented growth in our ability to understand and change the human genome. New reproductive technologies now enable parents to select some genetic traits for their children, and soon it will be possible to begin to shape ourselves as a species. Despite the loud cries of alarm that such a prospect inspires, Ronald Green argues that we will—and we should—undertake the direction of our own evolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A leader in the bioethics community, Green offers a scientifically and ethically informed view of human genetic self-modification and the possibilities it opens up for a better future. Fears of a terrible <i>Brave New World</i> or a new eugenics movement are overblown, he maintains, and in the more likely future, genetic modifications may improve parents’ ability to enhance children’s lives and may even promote social justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author outlines the new capabilities of genomic science, addresses urgent questions of safety that genetic interventions pose, and explores questions of parenting and justice. He also examines the religious implications of gene modification. Babies by design are assuredly in the future, Green concludes, and by making responsible choices as we enter that future, we can incorporate gene technology in a new age of human adventure.</p>

"A Poverty of Imagination: Bootstrap Capitalism, Sequel to Welfare Reform",['David Stoesz'],"<p>Welfare reform was supposed to end welfare as we know it. And it has. The welfare poor have been largely transformed into the working poor, but their poverty persists. This hard-hitting book takes a close look at where weâve gone wrong-and where we might go next if we truly want to improve the lot of Americaâs underclass.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracing the roots of recent reforms to the early days of the war on poverty, <i>A Poverty of Imagination</i> describes a social welfare system grown increasingly inept, corrupt, and susceptible to conservative redesign. Investigating the causes of the ongoing failure of welfare assistance, Stoesz focuses on the economic barriers that impede movement out of poverty into the American mainstream. He explores such issues as the heterogeneity of welfare families, generational welfare, inadequate benefits, the negative effects of time limits on welfare recipients, a fringe banking industry that exploits low-income families, the limited capacity of low-wage markets, and the unavailability of credit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoesz suggests that a form of bootstrap capitalism would allow individuals and families to participate more fully in American society and achieve upward economic mobility and stability. This proposal, emphasizing wage supplements, asset building, and community capitalism, sets the stage for the next act in poverty policy in the United States. With its valuable insights on the American welfare system and its positive agenda for change, this book makes a significant intervention in our ongoing struggle to come to terms with widespread poverty in the wealthiest nation on earth.</p>"

Wenda Gu: Art From Middle Kingdom To Biological Millennium,"['Gu, Wenda , 1955-']","<p>Wenda Gu is one of the leading contemporary Chinese artists of his generation. Known by some as ""the hair artist"" and remembered by others as the artist whose monumental installation was violently destroyed by a Russian artist at the infamous ""Interpol"" exhibition (Stockholm, 1996),he is part of the diaspora that has sent many Chinese artists to the West over the past twenty years. He has built his reputation on reinvigorating ancient Chinese symbols and practices—the seal, calligraphy, ink painting—with contemporary vision and meaning.Wenda Gu often uses genetic material—hair and blood—as his medium. His most ambitious, ongoing project, the United Nations series, consists of installations at sites around the world in which hair is used to create works of art emblematic of a future not ruled by racial or national boundaries. To mark the British handover of Hong Kong to China, for example, he created ""United Nations: Hong Kong Monument: The Historical Clash,"" which consisted of a Chinese flag made of Chinese hair, a Union Jack made of British hair,and hair cuttings from Hong Kong scattered on the floor. These ""united nations"" monuments have been installed so far in Australia, Canada, China, France, Great Britain, Holland, Hong Kong, Japan,Italy, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United States.Wenda Gu: Art from Middle Kingdom to Biological Millennium is the most comprehensive presentation of Wenda Gu's work to date. Two generous sections of plates document the United Nations series and other projects, many of which are presented in the exhibition this book accompanies. The book also includes previously unpublished writings by Gu, an interview with the artist by David Cateforis, and essays by Mark Bessire, the co-curator of the exhibit, and Gao Minglu and Gan Xu, both leading authorities on the new Chinese avant-garde.</p>"
Academic Turnarounds: Restoring Vitality To Challenged American Colleges And Universities,['Terrence MacTaggart'],"<p>What are the hallmarks of a lasting institutional turnaround? It is too easy to mistake a single initiative_mounting a new marketing program, for example, or bringing in a million dollar donation_for a true turnaround. Successful turnarounds involve profound, often difficult, actions that affect the finances, academic offerings, and reputations of colleges and universities. They take institutions to new levels of performance and then present new challenges. MacTaggart examines the several stages that comprise institutional turnarounds and offers practical advice on setting and reaching higher levels of performance. MacTaggart also discusses the early indicators of a college or university's need for a turnaround. He and his colleagues outline financial trends and other indicators of distress, as well as benchmarks for the various stages in an effective turnaround strategy. Academic Turnarounds will help trustees, presidents, and faculty members diagnose whether or not they are in denial over the true condition of the institution they are charged with preserving.

Why Some Children Succeed Despite The Odds,"['Brown', 'Waln K.', 'Rhodes', 'Warren']","<p>What determines whether a child will fall victim to his troubled surroundings or whether he will overcome the adversity and even emerge strengthened? Mental health professionals are beginning to focus on the identification of factors which can promote healthy adjustment, or, resilience, in children. In this volume, leading scholars in the field pioneer this alternative approach toward mental illness by attempting to define these factors of resilience which can then provide the groundwork for primary prevention specialists to develop and implement preventive rather than remedial programs for children designated at risk.</p>
<p>Unlike previous volumes which profile resilience in a small sample group, this study extends the search for an adequate psychological definition of resilience by examining many diverse populations ranging from stepchildren to developmentally delayed children to children of religious cults. Each group's psychological dynamics are thoroughly explored and the research documented, thereby providing a broad base of knowledge from which to derive a solid definition. A valid model for the recognition of positive motivations in children under stress is established and marks this work as a significant contribution to the literature on the psychology of wellness.</p>"

"Flames After Midnight: Murder, Vengeance, And The Desolation Of A Texas Community","['Akers', 'Monte']","<p>What happened in Kirven, Texas, in May 1922, has been forgotten by the outside world. It was a co-worker's whispered words, ""Kirven is where they burned the [Negroes],"" that set Monte Akers to work at discovering the true story behind a young white woman's brutal murder and the burning alive of three black men who were almost certainly innocent of it. This was followed by a month-long reign of terror as white men killed blacks while local authorities concealed the real identity of the white probable murderers and allowed them to go free.</p>
<p>Writing nonfiction with the skill of a novelist, Akers paints a vivid portrait of a community desolated by race hatred and its own refusal to face hard truths. He sets this tragedy within the story of a region prospering from an oil boom but plagued by lawlessness, and traces the lynching's repercussions down the decades to the present day.</p>
<p>What can the uncovering of yet another travesty do to improve race relations in light of the recent lynching in Jasper, Texas?

High-quality German-made products ranging from precision tools to automobiles again conquered world markets, and the country experienced stratospheric growth and virtually full employment. Germany (or West Germany, until 1989) returned to its position as the economic powerhouse of Europe and became the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>But in recent years growth has slowed, unemployment has soared, and the economic unification of eastern and western Germany has been mishandled. Europe's largest economy is now outperformed by many of its European neighbors in per capita terms. In Can Germany Be Saved?, Hans-Werner Sinn, one of Germany's leading economists, takes a frank look at his country's economic problems and proposes welfare- and tax-reform measures aimed at returning Germany to its former vigor and vitality.Germany invented the welfare state in the 1880s when Bismarck introduced government-funded health insurance,disability insurance, and pensions; the German system became a model for other industrialized countries. But, Sinn argues, today's German welfare state has incurred immense fiscal costs and destroyed economic incentives. Unemployment has become so lucrative that the private sector, already under pressure from international low-wage competitors, has increasing difficulties in paying sufficiently attractive wages.Sinn traces many of his country's economic problems to an increasingly intractable conflict between Germany's welfare state and the forces of globalization. Can Germany Be Saved? (an updated English-language version of a German bestseller) asks the hard questions—about unions, welfare payments, tax rates, the aging population, and immigration—that all advanced economies need to ask. Its answers, and its call for a radical rethinking of the welfare state,should stir debate and discussion everywhere.</p>"
Pastoral cities,['James L. Machor'],"<p>What has the city meant to Americans? James L. Machor explores this question in a provocative analysis of American responses to urbanization in the context of the cultureâs tendency to valorize nature and the rural world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although much attention has been paid to American rural-urban relations, Machor focuses on a dimension largely overlooked by those seeking to explain American conceptions of the city. While urban historians and literary critics have explicitly or implicitly emphasized the opposition between urban and rural sensibilities in America, an equally important feature of American thought and writing has been the widespread interest in collapsing that division. Convinced that the native landscape has offered special opportunities, Americans since the age of settlement have sought to build a harmonious urban-pastoral society combining the best of both worlds. Moreover, this goal has gone largely unchallenged in the culture except for the sophisticated responses in the writings of some of Americaâs most eminent literary artists.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Pastoral Cities</i> explains the development of urban pastoralism from its origins in the prophetic vision of the New Jerusalem, applied to America in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, through its secularization in the urban planning and reform of the 1800s. Machor critiques the sophisticated treatment of urban pastoralism by writers such as Emerson, Whitman, Hawthorne, Wharton, and James by skillfully by combining cultural analysis with a close reading of urban plans, travel narratives, sermons, and popular novels. The product of this multifaceted approach is an analysis that works to reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of the pastoral ideal as cultural mythology.</p>"
The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing,['William Kasdorf'],"<p>What is metadata? When do you need to archive digital content? How does electronic publication affect copyrights? How can XML and PDF improve your workflow and your publications? There is a digital dimension to virtually all publishing today. Beyond the obvious electronic media -- the music and movies we take for granted, the increasingly indispensable Web, the eBooks that most of us will take for granted in a few years -- almost everything we read, even on paper, was produced digitally. This new digital world offers a steadily increasing number of choices. It is this rich and rapidly changing publishing environment for which <i>The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing</i> was created. Although there is a vast amount of information on a host of topics relevant to digital production and publishing available -- some in print, more on the Web -- there has been, until now, no single resource to which those involved in any dimension of publishing could turn for guidance. <i>The Columbia Guide to Digital Publishing</i> fills that need.</p><p>The Guide is definitive: written by experts in the broad array of subjects it covers, it provides reliable, authoritative, user-friendly information about a vast number of topics. Designed to be the first place to go to learn about any of the numerous interrelated issues that define the digital publishing landscape, it offers readers a multilevel approach, from a brief glossary definition of a technical term or acronym (sometimes all a user needs), to a concise discussion of a topic (comprehensible to the lay person, yet useful for the technical expert). It puts a subject in the context of other topics and broader issues, with real-world examples, liberal cross-references, and pointers to sources of further information in print or electronic form.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
Dying To Kill: The Allure Of Suicide Terror,['Mia Bloom'],"<p>What motivates suicide bombers in Iraq and around the world? Can winning the hearts and minds of local populations stop them? Will the phenomenon spread to the United States? These vital questions are at the heart of this important book. Mia Bloom examines the use, strategies, successes, and failures of suicide bombing in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe and assesses the effectiveness of government responses. She argues that in many instances the efforts of Israel, Russia, and the United States in Iraq have failed to deter terrorism and suicide bombings. Bloom also considers how terrorist groups learn from one another, how they respond to counterterror tactics, the financing of terrorism, and the role of suicide attacks against the backdrop of larger ethnic and political conflicts.</p>
<p><i>Dying to Kill</i> begins with a review of the long history of terrorism, from ancient times to modernity, from the Japanese Kamikazes during World War II, to the Palestinian, Tamil, Iraqi, and Chechen terrorists of today. Bloom explores how suicide terror is used to achieve the goals of terrorist groups: to instill public fear, attract international news coverage, gain support for their cause, and create solidarity or competition between disparate terrorist organizations. She contends that it is often social and political motivations rather than inherently religious ones that inspire suicide bombers. In her chapter focusing on the increasing number of women suicide bombers and terrorists, Bloom examines Sri Lanka, where 33 percent of bombers have been women; Turkey, where the PKK used women feigning pregnancy as bombers; and the role of the Black Widows in the Chechen struggle against Moscow.</p>
<p>The motives of individuals, whether religious or nationalist, are important but the larger question is, what external factors make it possible for suicide terrorism to flourish? Bloom describes these conditions and develops a theory of why terrorist tactics work in some instances and fail in others.</p>

A Year In The Life Of A Shinto Shrine,['John K. Nelson'],"<p>What we today call Shinto has been at the heart of Japanese culture for almost as long as there has been a political entity distinguishing itself as Japan. <i>A Year in the Life of a Shinto Shrine</i> describes the ritual cycle at Suwa Shrine, Nagasaki's major Shinto shrine. Conversations with priests, other shrine personnel, and people attending shrine functions supplement John K. Nelson's observations of over fifty shrine rituals and festivals. He elicits their views on the meaning and personal relevance of the religious events and the place of Shinto and Suwa Shrine in Japanese society, culture, and politics. Nelson focuses on the very human side of an ancient institution and provides a detailed look at beliefs and practices that, although grounded in natural cycles, are nonetheless meaningful in late-twentieth-century Japanese society.</p>
<p>Nelson explains the history of Suwa Shrine, basic Shinto concepts, and the Shinto worldview, including a discussion of the Kami, supernatural forces that pervade the universe. He explores the meaning of ritual in Japanese culture and society and examines the symbols, gestures, dances, and meanings of a typical shrine ceremony. He then describes the cycle of activities at the shrine during a calendar year: the seasonal rituals and festivals and the petitionary, propitiary, and rite-of-passage ceremonies performed for individuals and specific groups. Among them are the Dolls' Day festival, in which young women participate in a procession and worship service wearing Heian period costumes; the autumn Okunchi festival, which attracts participants from all over Japan and even brings emigrants home for a visit; the ritual invoking the blessing of the Kami for young children; and the ritual sanctifying the earth before a building is constructed. The author also describes the many roles women play in Shinto and includes an interview with a female priest.</p>
<p>Shinto has always been attentive to the protection of communities from unpredictable human and divine forces and has imbued its ritual practices with techniques and strategies to aid human life. By observing the Nagasaki shrine's traditions and rituals, the people who make it work, and their interactions with the community at large, the author shows that cosmologies from the past are still very much a part of the cultural codes utilized by the nation and its people to meet the challenges of today.</p>"
The Management Challenge: Japanese Views,"['Thurow', 'Lester C (editor)']","<p>What works for the Japanese? As our nation's balance of trade with Japan dips Eastward, American managers ask how Japan's economy has outperformed ours during the past 30 years. Some of the answers may be found in the original contributions in this book which are unique in presenting Japanese management as the Japanese see it. They provide American managers with insights into practices that may spark new solutions to old economic problems.Chapters cover motivation and productivity, the impact of Japanese culture on management, perceptions and reality of Japanese industrial relations, the firm and the market, the Japanese financial system, product diversification, strategy for overseas markets, competition and cooperation among Japanese corporations, industrial policy, economic planning, and the Japanese economy. Thurow's introduction provides a unifying framework and his comments on each chapter point up the implications that each contribution raises for the reblending of the American economic mixture.Lester C.

Talking With Sartre: Conversations And Debates,['John Gerassi'],"<p>What would it be like to be privy to the mind of one of the twentieth century’s greatest thinkers? John Gerassi had just this opportunity; as a child, his mother and father were very close friends with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and the couple became for him like surrogate parents. Authorized by Sartre to write his biography, Gerassi conducted a long series of interviews between 1970 and 1974, which he has now edited to produce this revelatory and breathtaking portrait of one of the world’s most famous intellectuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the interviews, with both their informalities and their tensions, Sartre’s greater complexities emerge. In particular, we see Sartre wrestling with the apparent contradiction between his views on freedom and the influence of social conditions on our choices and actions. We also gain insight into his perspectives on the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and the disintegration of colonialism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These conversations add an intimate dimension to Sartre’s more abstract ideas. With remarkable rigor and intensity, they also provide a clear lens through which to view the major conflagrations of the past century.</p>

"Heroes Or Traitors: The German Replacement Army, The July Plot, And Adolf Hitler",['Walter S. Dunn Jr.'],"<p>When a German victory became impossible, the July 1944 conspirators plotted to bring a quick end to the war, hoping to negotiate a peace with the Western allies and possibly to join them in a war against Russia. Because the Allies would not negotiate with Hitler, the plotters planned to assassinate him and seize control of the government, using the Replacement Army to overcome the S.S. and the Nazi Party.</p>
<p>This army would also maintain order within Germany, a task that would require more than half-a-million trained men. The conspirators convinced key Replacement Army officers to withhold men from the Field Army in the spring of 1944 in preparation for taking over the country. The result was a German army that lacked enough reserve divisions to counter the invasion of France and the Red Army attack in Russia. Although the plotters failed to kill Hitler, they hastened the war's end by weakening the German army. Dunn examines the 1944 July Plot from a manpower and logistics perspective to demonstrate that the conspirators did, in fact, achieve their goal of hastening the war's end.</p>"
Bernard Shaw,"['Peters, Sally.', 'Shaw, Bernard']","<p>When he died in 1950, Bernard Shaw was a Nobel laureate hailed as the second greatest playwright in the English language. At the same time, his strangely flamboyant personality, so teeming with eccentricities and contradictions, aroused unquenchable curiosity. Despite many investigations into Shaw's life and art, parts of him—parts crucial to understanding both man and artist—have remained veiled in secrecy. In this critical biography, Sally Peters explores Shaw's background and beliefs, interests and obsessions, relations with men and women, prose writings and dramatic art. In deciphering the enigma that was Shaw, she uncovers a convoluted and extravagant inner life studded with erotic secrets.<br>
<br>
Peters examines the passions of Shaw's life—everything from vegetarianism and boxing to socialism and feminism—and pieces them together in a new configuration, offering a fresh interpretation of his life and works. Striving unceasingly to ascend, possessed of monumental energy, Shaw was in many ways a dazzling example of his idealized superman. But, says Peters, this superman was also a man haunted by phantoms, a man of gender ambivalences and romantic yearnings, and a man who championed will even while believing that his erotic inclinations were the secret mark of the ""born artist."" Throughout, he was braced by a resilient comic vision as he transformed his life into enduring art.<br>

Women For President: Media Bias In Eight Campaigns,"['Falk, Erika.']","<p>When Hillary Clinton announced her 2008 bid for president she was the Democratic front-runner. Despite this, she received less coverage than Barack Obama, who trailed her in the polls. Such a disparity is indicative of the gender bias the media has demonstrated in covering women candidates since the first woman ran for America’s highest office in 1872. Tracing the campaigns of eight women who ran for president through 2004—Victoria Woodhull, Belva Lockwood, Margaret Chase Smith, Shirley Chisholm, Patricia Schroeder, Lenora Fulani, Elizabeth Dole, and Carol Moseley Braun—Erika Falk finds little progress in the fair treatment of women candidates. A thorough comparison of the women’s campaigns to those of their male opponents reveals a worrisome trend of sexism in press coverage—a trend that still persists today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While women have been elected to the highest offices in countries such as England, Germany, and India, the idea that a woman could be president of the United States provokes scoffs and ridicule. The press portrays female candidates as unviable, unnatural, and incompetent, and often ignores or belittles women instead of reporting their ideas and intent. Since voters learn most details about presidential candidates through media outlets, Falk asserts that this prevailing bias calls into question the modern democratic assumption that men and women have comparable access to positions of power.</p>"

Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir,"['Michael Donnelly', 'Denise Donnelly']","<p>When Major Michael Donnelly was instructing his U.S. Air Force student pilots, he used to tell them three things: Timing is everything; it's nice to be lucky; and there is no justice. Highly decorated fighter pilot, proud young patriot, loyal friend with a mischievous sense of humor, loving husband and father of two, he could not have imagined the tragic meaning those words would assume just a few years after his tour of duty in Desert Storm. In 1996 Major Donnelly was diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease, at the unusually young age of 35; the onset of this illness marked the beginning of a kind of torture beyond the scope of even the most rigorous military survival training. Betrayed by his body, eventually paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, he experienced another betrayal perhaps even more difficult to comprehend—betrayal by his country. For despite the fact that over 110,000 Desert Storm veterans are sick, many dying of mysterious cancers and neurological diseases, including more than ten times the normal incidence of ALS—and despite all evidence pointing to U.S. troops having been dosed by low levels of Iraqi nerve agents and exposed to chemical weapons' fallout—the Pentagon adamantly denies any connection between their illnesses and their service in the Gulf War. <i>Falcon's Cry: A Desert Storm Memoir</i>, Michael Donnelly's unforgettable story, is his courageous attempt to unearth the truth and force an acknowledgment of that truth by the government he and his fellow veterans defended with their lives.</p>
<p>Flying 44 fighter jet combat missions in a war fought on an all-or-nothing scale was thrilling for Michael Donnelly. When the war was won, he and his country rejoiced in the knowledge that, unlike in Vietnam, America had gotten it right in the Persian Gulf. Less than a decade later, the world is learning what veterans and their families have known since Desert Storm—we did not get it right at all. Saddam Hussein is still terrorizing a large portion of the globe. Moreover, we did not learn the lesson of Agent Orange which the Department of Defense denied for decades was the cause of early deaths and birth defects among Vietnam veterans and their families. Yet, thanks largely to the testimony of the author before the House of Representatives in 1997, a first step has been taken toward justice for the tens of thousands of Desert Storm veterans who are suffering virtually in isolation, many without any medical or disability benefits. Major Donnelly believes the truth about Gulf War Illnesses will be uncovered by studies funded in the recently passed Omnibus Appropriations bill, as well as through stories like his own, and he fervently hopes that America can, at last, get it right.</p>"
Darker Than The Deepest Sea,['Trevor Dann'],"<p>When Nick Drake (1948-1974) died of a drug overdose at twenty-six, he left behind three modest-selling albums, including the stark <i>Pink Moon</i> and the lush <i>Bryter Layter</i>. Three decades later, he is recognized as one of the true geniuses of English acoustic music. Yet Nick Drake—whose music was as gentle and melancholy as the man himself— has always maintained a spectral presence in popular music. This groundbreaking biography reconstructs a vanished life while perfectly capturing the bohemian scenes surrounding the music business in London in the late '60s and early '70s. Using many newly discovered documents and all-new interviews, Trevor Dann reveals more detail on Nick Drake than ever, from his upbringing in a quintessentially English village, through his hash-fueled school days at Cambridge University, to the missed opportunities and mismanagement that defined his career. Friends and colleagues describe the difficulties that he faced as each new album was released, only to fail, and the insidious despair that consumed him. Complete with discography and rare photos, <i>Darker Than the Deepest Sea</i> is essential reading for anyone who has been moved by Nick Drake's unforgettable blend of beauty and sadness.</p>"
God And The Welfare State,['Lew Daly'],"<p>When the Bush administration's faith-based initiative was introduced in 2001 as the next stage of the ""war on poverty,"" it provoked a flurry of protest for violating the church-state divide. Most critics didn't ask whether it could work.God and the Welfare State is the first book to trace the ideas behind George W. Bush's faith-based initiative from their roots in Catholic natural law theory and Dutch Calvinism to an American think tank, the Center for Public Justice. Comparing Bush's plan with the ways the same ideas have played out in Christian Democratic welfare policies in Europe, the author is skeptical that it will be an effective new way to fight poverty. But he takes the animating ideas very seriously, as they go to the heart of the relationship among religion,government, and social welfare.In the end Daly argues that these ideas—which are now entrenched in federal and state politics—are a truly radical departure from American traditions of governance.</p>
<p>Although Bush's initiative roughly overlaps with more conventional conservative efforts to strengthen private power in economic life, it promises an unprecedented shift in the balance of power between secular and religious approaches to social problems and suggests a broader template for ""faith-based governance,"" in which the state would have a much more limited role in social policy.</p>"
Battling for Manassas : The Fifty-Year Preservation Struggle at Manassas National Battlefield Park,['Joan M. Zenzen'],"<p>When the Disney Company ended months of controversy in 1995 by deciding against locating its historic theme park near the National Battlefield Park in Manassas, Virginia, advocates of historic preservation had won their own battle but perhaps not their war.</p><p>Few places exemplify the problems of historic preservation as urgently as Manassas. The site of this Civil War battle, also known as Bull Run, has been encroached upon by plans for an interstate highway, a cemetery, a shopping mall, and two theme parks. As Washington continues its sprawl into the Virginia countryside, pressure will surely mount to develop the remaining open land surrounding the battlefield.</p><p>The history of Manassas battlefield illustrates that the Disney controversy is only the latest in a long line of skirmishes over historic preservation and use. <em>Battling for Manassas</em> is a record of the struggles to preserve the park over the past fifty years. First commissioned as a report by the National Park Service, this book tells how park managers, government officials, preservationists, developers, and concerned citizens have managed to find compromises that would protect the site while accommodating changes in the surrounding community.</p><p>Joan Zenzen's narrative places these highly publicized preservation conflicts within the framework of the park's history. She traces the efforts to preserve this Civil War battleground as it has slowly been surrounded by suburban development and discloses how issues involving visitors' facilities, recreation use of parkland, non-park-related usage, and encroachment on park boundaries by commercial interests have all come into play. Her study draws on interviews with many individuals who have been influential in the park's history-including park service officials, members of Congress, representatives of preservation groups, developers, and local officials-as well as on archival documents that help explain the nature of each controversy. She also shows that the Park Service's reluctance to conduct long-range planning following the controversy over Marriott's proposed Great America theme park contributed to later battles over development.</p><p><em>Battling for Manassas</em> is the story of how one site has garnered national attention and taught Americans valuable lessons about the future of historic preservation. It demonstrates to everyone interested in the Civil War that, with only 58 of 384 sites currently under Park Service jurisdiction, what has happened at Manassas might well occur on other historic grounds threatened by development or neglect.</p>"
"Reflections Of Pearl Harbor: An Oral History Of December 7, 1941",['K. D. Richardson'],"<p>When the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on American bases in Hawaii, the people of the United States knew instantly that the nation was at war. So devastating was the news to a country still largely in the throes of a depression that survivors can still recall some six decades later where they were, who gave them the news, the clothes they were wearing, and the confusion and eventual hardships that such a development brought. This collection of memories, told in participants' own words, gathers accounts from both military and civilians, children and adults, people of many ethnic backgrounds, from all over of the United States. Together, these ordinary Americans paint a portrait of a nation stunned, but determined to rise again.</p>
<p>While few if any were left unmoved by the prospect of war, some grief was immediate: The hangar was bombed causing it to collapse, killing my brother. For others, it raised deep questions about a once secure sense of identity: I did wonder why we (Japanese Americans) were singled out. What about the German Americans? With each passing year, more members of this generation pass from our midst, taking a piece of history with them. Determined to preserve these accounts, Richardson includes 160 personal narratives that describe a day in the life of America; that day was December 7, 1941.</p>"
"Jerusalem's Traitor: Josephus, Masada, And The Fall Of Judea",['Desmond Seward'],"<p>When the Jews revolted against Rome in 66 CE, Josephus, a Jerusalem aristocrat, was made a general in his nation’s army. Captured by the Romans, he saved his skin by finding favor with the emperor Vespasian. He then served as an adviser to the Roman legions, running a network of spies inside Jerusalem, in the belief that the Jews’ only hope of survival lay in surrender to Rome.</p>
<p>As a Jewish eyewitness who was given access to Vespasian’s campaign notebooks, Josephus is our only source of information for the war of extermination that ended in the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple, and the amazing times in which he lived. He is of vital importance for anyone interested in the Middle East, Jewish history, and the early history of Christianity.</p>"
The Jaguar's Shadow: Searching for a Mythic Cat,['Richard Mahler'],"<p>When the nature writer Richard Mahler discovers that wild jaguars are prowling a remote corner of his home state of New Mexico, he embarks on a determined quest to see in the flesh a big, beautiful cat that is the stuff of legend-yet verifiably real.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mahlerâs passion sets in motion a years-long adventure through trackless deserts, steamy jungles, and malarial swamps, as well as a confounding immersion in centuries-old debates over how we should properly regard these powerful predators: as varmints or as icons, trophies or gods? He is drawn from border badlands south to Panamaâs rain forest along a route where the fate of nearly all wildlife now rests in human hands. Mahlerâs odyssey introduces him to unrepentant poachers, pragmatic ranchers, midnight drug-runners, ardent conservationists, trance-induced shamans, hopeful biologists, stodgy bureaucrats, academic philosophers, macho hunters, and gentle Maya Indians. Along the way, he is forced to reconsider the true meaning of his search-and the enduring symbolism of the jaguar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
Germaine de Staël & Benjamin Constant: a dual biography,"['Winegarten, Renee.']","<p>When they first met in 1794, shortly after the Reign of Terror, Germaine de Staël and Benjamin Constant were both in their twenties, both married, and both outsiders. She was already celebrated and a published writer, whereas he, though ambitious, was unknown. This compelling dual biography tells the extraordinary story of their union and disunion, set against a European background of momentous events and dramatic social and cultural change. Renee Winegarten offers new perspectives on each of the protagonists, revealing their rare qualities and their all-too-human failings as well as the complex nature of their debt to one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their passionate and productive relationship endured on and off for seventeen years. Winegarten traces their story largely through their own words—letters and autobiographical writings—and illuminates the deep intellectual and visceral bond they shared despite disparate personalities and gifts. Exploring their relationships with Napoleon and the Bourbons, their different responses to the momentous upheavals of postrevolutionary France, their support of individual liberty with order, and more, the book concludes with an appreciation of de Staël’s and Constant’s singular contributions to a new literature and to the history of liberty.</p>"
Financial Founding Fathers: The Men Who Made America Rich,"['Robert E. Wright', 'David J. Cowen']","<p>When you think of the founding fathers, you think of men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin—exceptional minds and matchless statesmen who led the colonies to a seemingly impossible victory over the British and established the constitutional and legal framework for our democratic government. But the American Revolution was about far more than freedom and liberty. It was about economics as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert E. Wright and David J. Cowen here chronicle how a different group of founding fathers forged the wealth and institutions necessary to transform the American colonies from a diffuse alliance of contending business interests into one cohesive economic superpower. From Alexander Hamilton to Andrew Jackson, the authors focus on the lives of nine Americans in particular—some famous, some unknown, others misunderstood, but all among our nation’s financial founding fathers. Such men were instrumental in creating and nurturing a financial system that drove economic growth in the nascent United States because they were quick to realize that wealth was as crucial as the Constitution in securing the blessings of liberty and promoting the general welfare. The astonishing economic development made possible by our financial founding fathers was indispensable to the preservation of national unity and of support for a government that was then still a profoundly radical and delicate political experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grand in scope and vision, <i>Financial Founding Fathers</i> is an entertaining and inspiring history of the men who made America rich and steered her toward greatness.</p>"

"Henry The Fourth, Part One (the Annotated Shakespeare) (pt. 1)",['William Shakespeare'],"<p>While England is threatened by the Earl of Northumberland, Young Prince Hal cavorts in London's taverns, accompanied by the dissolute, entertaining Falstaff and his band of rogues. Much of this play's tension involves Prince Hal and Falstaff, as the former tries to live up to his duties and responsibilities. In creating Falstaff Shakespeare gave us one of the theater's most enduring and memorable characters.</p>"
Against Long Odds: Citizens Who Challenge Congressional Incumbents,"['Merriner, James L. , 1947-']","<p>While many books detail how senators and representatives operate in Washington, this one describes how they stay in power. The congressional elections of 1998 were the most expensive in history. Incumbency reelection rates were 98.3 percent in the House and 89.7 percent in the Senate, and this was a typical outcome after Watergate-era campaign reforms supposedly <i>reduced</i> the influence of money in politics. From the unique vantage of credible citizen-candidates who ran against congressional incumbents from Massachusetts to Hawaii during the 1990s, <i>Against Long Odds</i> tackles the question of why incumbents nearly always win.</p>
<p>These citizen-challengers learned that the system is rigged against them. Incumbents prevail through a virtual monopoly on campaign cash, lavish congressional perks, local media and business backing, intimidation of their challengers' supporters, and sometimes outright dirty tricks. This is true for Republicans and Democrats; for conservatives, moderates, and liberals alike. This account details, as no other book has, how representatives and senators are zealous participants in a system that threatens to overturn the American traditions of free elections and the free exchange of ideas. Frustrated voters often complain that, no matter which party controls Congress, nothing ever really seems to change. Merriner and Senter explain why.</p>"
Shipshewana: An Indiana Amish Community,['Dorothy O. Pratt'],"<p>While most books about the Amish focus on the Pennsylvania settlements or on the religious history of the sect, this book is a cultural history of one Indiana Amish community and its success in resisting assimilation into the larger culture. Amish culture has persisted relatively unchanged primarily because the Amish view the world around them through the prism of their belief in collective salvation based on purity, separation, and perseverance. Would anything new add or detract from the communityâs long-term purpose? Seen through this prism, most innovation has been found wanting.</p><p>Founded in 1841, Shipshewana benefited from LaGrange Countyâs relative isolation. As Dorothy O. Pratt shows, this isolation was key to the communityâs success. The Amish were able to develop a stable farming economy and a social structure based on their own terms. During the years of crisis, 1917â1945, the Amish worked out ways to protect their boundaries that would not conflict with their basic religious principles. As conscientious objectors, they bore the traumas of World War I, struggled against the Compulsory School Act of 1921, negotiated the labyrinth of New Deal bureaucracy, and labored in Alternative Service during World War II. The story Pratt tells of the postwar years is one of continuing difficulties with federal and state regulations and challenges to the conscientious objector status of the Amish. The necessity of presenting a united front to such intrusions led to the creation of the Amish Steering Committee. Still, Pratt notes that the committeeâs effect has been limited. Crisis and abuse from the outer world have tended only to confirm the desire of the Amish to remain a people apart, and lends a special poignancy to this engrossing tale of resistance to the modern world.</p>"
When Women Become Priests: The Catholic Women's Ordination Debate,['Kelley A. Raab'],"<p>While numerous provocative works have sought to justify why women should be ordained as Catholic priests, <i>When Women Become Priests</i> is the first sustained reflection on the differences that would obtain with women at the altar. In the face of a centuries-old tradition of a male priesthood, what are the implications for the Catholic church of ordaining women? Would women priests become co-opted into the male clerical caste, particularly in relation to celebrating the sacraments? In an analysis that deftly unites feminist criticism, psychoanalysis, and Catholic theology, Kelley A. Raab explores the symbolic implications of women at the altar, providing rich insight into issues of gender, symbolism, and power.</p><p><i>When Women Become Priests</i> addresses critical issues about the effect of a female priest on the parishioners she would serve, on the sacrament of communion, and on the significance of the symbolism of Jesus that priest maintain during certain ceremonies. Rooted in her firm belief in the place of women within the Catholic priesthood, Raab's work is one that -- rather than reducing religious convictions to psychological construct -- seeks to re-invigorate these convictions for the contemporary world.</p><p>Supported by interviews with women in the Episcopal priesthood (which has ordained women since 1977), Raab draws upon object-relations theory, Freudian concepts of the unconscious, and French feminist thinkers Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray to show how the celebration of mass by women priests would require a constructive reenvisioning of core dimensions of Catholic theology.</p>"

Afterglow: A Last Conversation With Pauline Kael,['Francis Davis'],"<p>Who else but Pauline Kael would have said: ""It's not fun writing about bad movies. I used to think it was bad for my skin."" On September 3, 2001, the movies and those who love them lost one of their greatest friends-a friend who never tired of championing the best that the movies could offer and didn't shrink from taking to task any film, director, or actor she thought deserved a taste of her famously acerbic wit. Kael's insight, spirit, and straight-shooting won her singular respect in both movie and literary circles, as well as a passionate following for her New Yorker columns and her inimitably titled books such as I Lost It at the Movies and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Shortly before her death, Kael sat down with Francis Davis for a series of conversations about her life and work-and, of course, the movies. Among many, many things she talks here of her early days as a critic, her career at the New Yorker, the directors she knew (for better or worse), her disappointment with recent cinema, and her renewed interest in television. It's funny, it's controversial, it's right-on-the-mark-and time and again you realize that no could would have dared to say that, in just that way, except Pauline Kael.</p>"
A Violent Heart: Understanding Aggressive Individuals,"['Moffatt, Gregory K. , 1961-']","<p>Why are some people violent and aggressive while others are not? Where do these negative emotions and actions come from? What can be done to prevent dangerous behavior? Drawing upon years of research and experience as a therapist, lecturer, and consultant to law enforcement and business, Moffatt presents a broad perspective on the psychological and sociological roots of aggression. Using both case studies and theoretical constructs from several different fields, this work provides an overview of the diverse mix of factors that create individuals with a propensity to resort to violence. Topics include domestic violence, the violent child, mass murder, terrorism, serial killing, murder for hire, and hate crimes. Moffatt also details the growing phenomena of road rage, air rage, and sports rage.</p>
<p>Avoiding complex psychological jargon, Moffatt helps the general reader to understand and easily apply these concepts. He also addresses intervention techniques and deterrents to criminal behavior, ranging from rehabilitation, to revised prison sentencing, to the death penalty. Stories of successful intervention and recovery round out the volume.</p>"
The Lost Meaning Of Classical Architecture: Speculations On Ornament From Vitruvius To Venturi,"['Hersey, George L.']","<p>Why do architects still use the classical orders? Why use forms derived from ancient Greek temples when ancient Greek religion has been dead for centuries and when the way of life they expressed is extinct? And why decorate a contemporary courthouse with the bones, eggs, darts, claws,and garlands that an ancient Greek would recognize as the trappings of animal sacrifice? With these provocative questions George Hersey begins his recovery of the meaning of classical architecture.</p>
<p>For the last four centuries, he shows, philology and formalism have drained architecture of its poetry. By analyzing this poetry - the tropes founded on the Greek terms for ornamental detail - he reconstructs a classical theory about the origin and meaning of the orders, one that links them to ancient sacrificial ritual and myth.In doing so, Hersey reinterprets key tales and taboos that were part of the cultural memory of the ancient Greeks. His touchstone is Vitruvius, author of the only surviving classical treatise on architecture, whose stories about Dorus, Ion, and the Corinthian maiden, and about the Caryaean women and Persian soldiers, describe the orders as records or remembrances of sacrifice.Hersey finds revivals of this consciousness in the Italian Renaissance and throws new light on the works of the architectural theorists Francesco di Giorgio and Ceasare Cesariano, and also on Raphael's Disputá, Michelangelo's tomb of Julius 11 and Medici Chapel, and Hugues Sambin's handbook on termini.George Hersey is Professor of Art History at Yale University and the author of many books, including Architecture, Poetry, and Number in the Royal Palace at Caserta (MIT Press 1983).</p>

In The Shadow Of The Rising Sun: The Political Roots Of American Economic Decline,['William  S. Dietrich'],"<p>Why is the United States unable to compete effectively with Japan? What explains the inability of American political leaders to devise an industrial policy capable of focusing the energies of American business on the task of meeting the Japanese challenge? How can America emerge from the shadow of the Rising Sun? This book addresses these questions and proposes a controversial decision.</p>
<p>To get at the political roots of American economic decline, businessman-scholar William Dietrich puts the disciplined thinking of political philosophy, comparative politics, and international political economy to effective use in analyzing the source and nature of American institutional weakness.</p>
<p>Unlike many who have written on U.S.-Japanese relations, Dietrich does not seek a solution a particular new policy or institutional innovation, such as an American counterpart to Japan's MITI. Rather, he emphasizes the systemic nature of America's problems. The failures of management, finance, and politics are interlocking and reinforcing, he shows, and thus a change in the others that spell doom for any partial approach.</p>
<p>Most fundamental, however, are the political weaknesses of the system. It is in the basic political inheritance of America, reflected in the very design of the Constitution and the long dominance of Jeffersonian individualism over Hamiltonian statism, that we must locate the roots of American impotence in the face of Japan's challenge.</p>
<p>As the problem is systemic, so must the solution be equally wide-ranging. Nothing short of ""fundamental institutional reform,"" Dietrich argues, will succeed in reversing America's downward course.</p>
<p>Boasts about the victory of free-market capitalism in the wake of the collapse of the Communist state-directed system are premature and distract attention form the necessary recognition that it is the Japanese combination of the free market with a strong central state and a highly skilled professional bureaucracy that has really proved triumphant in our modern age of advanced technology. Only if we fully understand the reasons for Japanese success and American decline can we begin the arduous but crucial task of reconstructing the American polity to give it the power required to formulate and implement a national industrial policy that can regain for the United States its preeminent place among the world's industrial powers.</p>
<p>The alternative, Dietrich describes in a chilling scenario, is a ""Pax Nipponica"" that will find America playing second fiddle to Japan with economic, cultural, and political consequences that will make Britain's eclipse by the United States earlier in this century seem mild by comparison.</p>"
Inventing English A Portable History of the Language,['Seth Lerer'],"<p>Why is there such a striking difference between English spelling and English pronunciation? How did our seemingly relatively simple grammar rules develop? What are the origins of regional dialect, literary language, and everyday speech, and what do they have to do with you?</p><p>Seth Lerer's <i>Inventing English</i> is a masterful, engaging history of the English language from the age of <i>Beowulf</i> to the rap of Eminem. Many have written about the evolution of our grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary, but only Lerer situates these developments in the larger history of English, America, and literature.</p><p>Lerer begins in the seventh century with the poet Caedmon learning to sing what would become the earliest poem in English. He then looks at the medieval scribes and poets who gave shape to Middle English. He finds the traces of the Great Vowel Shift in the spelling choices of letter writers of the fifteenth century and explores the achievements of Samuel Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> of 1755 and <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He describes the differences between English and American usage and, through the example of Mark Twain, the link between regional dialect and race, class, and gender. Finally, he muses on the ways in which contact with foreign languages, popular culture, advertising, the Internet, and e-mail continue to shape English for future generations.</p><p>Each concise chapter illuminates a moment of invention-a time when people discovered a new form of expression or changed the way they spoke or wrote. In conclusion, Lerer wonders whether globalization and technology have turned English into a world language and reflects on what has been preserved and what has been lost. A unique blend of historical and personal narrative, <i>Inventing English</i> is the surprising tale of a language that is as dynamic as the people to whom it belongs.</p><p> Columbia University Press</p>"
"My Turf: Horses, Boxers, Blood Money, And The Sporting Life",['William Nack'],"<p>William Nack is widely acknowledged as one of the finest sports writers of the past half-century. He has won the prestigious Eclipse Award, given annually for the best magazine piece on horseracing, an unprecedented six times. Laura Hillenbrand, best-selling author of Seabiscuit, recently called his acclaimed biography Secretariat the ""gold standard"" of horse books. But Nack's ""turf"" goes far beyond the racetrack.In this, his first collection, Nack's finest horse racing journalism is coupled with his legendary, one-of-a-kind profiles of athletes from Sonny Liston to Formula One driver Alex Zanardi, Rocky Marciano to Rick Pitino, and Keith Hernandez to Willie Shoemaker. And that is not all. From his compelling history of Yankee Stadium, to his inspiring account of Bob Kalsu, the only professional American athlete to die in Vietnam, to his poignant portrait of Cincinnati Reds catcher Willard Hershberger, who, at fifteen, discovered his father dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and later committed suicide himself, Nack serves up riveting stories of people and places. He also uncovers some of the dirtiest secrets in sports from the shady world of hit men and greedy owners who hire them to kill their horses for insurance payoffs to weightlifting muscle men, who, while stoked up on steroids, have gone on murderous rampages. Whether writing about famous athletes-human and equine-or weighing in on some of the most controversial events and personalities in sports, William Nack has few equals.</p>"

"National Security In Saudi Arabia: Threats, Responses, And Challenges (praeger Security International)",['Anthony H. Cordesman'],"<p>With continuing instability in Iraq, the threat of a nuclear Iran, and the ever-present reality of further terrorist attacks within its own borders, Saudi Arabia has been forced to make some hard decisions. The current structure of the Saudi security apparatus is only one pathway to improved security. Economic and demographic threats may well be the hardest hurdles to overcome. What has been accomplished since 2001 and what are the real prospects and implications of further reform? To what extent should the kingdom continue to rely on the US to protect its interests?</p>
<p>Cordesman and Obaid argue that it is time to put an end to client and tutorial relations. Saudi Arabia must emerge as a true partner. This will require the creation of effective Saudi forces for both defense and counterterrorism. Saudi Arabia has embarked on a process of political, economic, and social reforms that reflects a growing understanding by the governing members of the royal family, Saudi technocrats, and Saudi businessmen that Saudi Arabia must reform and diversify its economy and must create vast numbers of new jobs for its young and growing population. There is a similar understanding that economic reform must be combined with some level of political and social reform if Saudi Arabia is to remain stable in the face of change. With Gulf security, the war on terrorism, and the security of some sixty percent of the world's oil reserves at stake, the real question is how quickly Saudi Arabia can change and adapt its overall approach to security, and how successful it will be in the process.</p>"
Kicking The Carbon Habit: Global Warming And The Case For Renewable And Nuclear Energy,['William Sweet'],"<p>With glaciers melting, oceans growing more acidic, species dying out, and catastrophic events like Hurricane Katrina ever more probable, strong steps must be taken now to slow global warming. Further warming threatens entire regional economies and the well being of whole populations, and in this century alone, it could create a global cataclysm. Synthesizing information from leading scientists and the most up-to-date research, science journalist William Sweet examines what the United States can do to help prevent climate devastation.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on cutting oil consumption, which Sweet argues is expensive and unrealistic, the United States should concentrate on drastically reducing its use of coal. Coal-fired plants, which currently produce more than half of the electricity in the United States, account for two fifths of the country's greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Sweet believes a mixture of more environmentally sound technologies-wind turbines, natural gas, and nuclear reactors-can effectively replace coal plants, especially since dramatic improvements in technology have made nuclear power cleaner, safer, and more efficient.</p>
<p>Sweet cuts through all the confusion and controversies. He explores dramatic advances made by climate scientists over the past twenty years and addresses the various political and economic issues associated with global warming, including the practicality of reducing emissions from automobiles, the efficacy of taxing energy consumption, and the responsibility of the United States to its citizens and the international community to reduce greenhouse gases. Timely and provocative, <i>Kicking the Carbon Habit</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in environmental science, economics, and the future of the planet.</p>

Feather: A Child's Death And Life,['Robert Louis Peters'],"<p>With great tenderness, poet and critic Robert Peters recalls the brief life and sudden death of his son Richard, a four-year-old called “Feather” by his sister Meredith and brother Rob. Feather returns home ill one day from nursery school, spends the afternoon in bed with his father and his stuffed toy seal, and dies that evening. Looking back after decades on that February day in 1960, when the skinned knees, colds, and fevers of childhood were obliterated by the unthinkable—fatal meningitis—Peters sees with harrowing clarity the image of that little boy in the tugboat pajamas lying still on a gurney, one bare foot visible at the edge of the sheet. He recalls his anger, his confusion: “What shall I do with my hands?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Feather: A Child’s Death and Life</i> is an album of poetic and sometimes visceral snapshots: portraits of a family, a house, a strained marriage, a father reading poems to his children, a young academic struggling to establish himself, Peters catches his family in moments of almost transcendent joy and crushing grief. The children’s happiness on Christmas morning, in summer at a Canadian lake, or ice skating is shadowed by lessons in accepting death: a succession of pet turtles, mice, and goldfish succumb; Dad butchers the Thanksgiving turkey, nicknamed “Gobble,” in the snowy backyard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth book in Robert Peters’ series of memoirs, <i>Feather</i> not only illuminates the lives of father and child, but also reflects a moment in the life of a writer, as Peters’ grief for his son finds expression in his first collection of poetry, <i>Songs for a Son</i>.</p>"
"Crossroads At Midlife: Your Aging Parents, Your Emotions, And Your Self",['Frances Cohen Praver'],"<p>With medical science, health care, and healthy lifestyles extending our lifespans as never before, more and more midlife adults are finding themselves caring for their aging parents. This role can trigger not only logistical and financial challenges, but also great emotional upheaval. There is a reversal of roles as the child—often in the midst of raising his or her own adolescent or young adult offspring—becomes the caretaker of the parent. A parent's aging and mortality elicits strong feelings of loss, and a stark realization of one's own aging and mortality. Past, present, and future paths converge, and the caretaker is at the center of that crossroads. Psychologist Praver—a specialist working with such caretakers—shows us their inner worlds, and how they used a difficult point in their lives to embark on a journey of self-understanding and self-transformation—a journey toward a more meaningful life for themselves.</p>
<p>Readers can gain a better understanding of their own lives— and know they are not alone in their struggles to contend with and find powerful benefits from the emotional side of caring for an aging parent. Distress can become peace of mind, as we see in the stories of men and women who sought Praver's help. Relationships that might be weakened by a caretaker role—relationships between caretakers and their children, spouses, and friends—can actually grow stronger with the experience. Profound issues affecting caretakers are shared in this evocative book, which is an enlightening and enjoyable read.</p>"
Wild China,"['John MacKinnon', 'Nigel Hicks']","<p>with photographs by Nigel Hicks China is a country of incredible diversity. Its widely varied habitats support a wealth of animals, birds, and plants that make this country biologically one of the richest on our planet. Illustrated with over 400 superb color photographs,Wild China surveys these treasures. It explores reserves where the elusive Giant Panda is now protected, alpine meadows that are a botanist's wonderland of floral species, wetlands that are home to a million birds, turtle islands, and tigers' stalking grounds.Following a scene-setting introduction, chapters focus on each of the country's major ecological regions in turn, from the peaks of Qomolangma (Mount Everest) to the world's second-lowest point in the Turpan Basin, from tropical rain forests in the south to the permafrost of Manchuria and the cold dry desert of the northwest, from vast grasslands and alpine meadows to the teeming yellow waters of the Yangtze River.A human population of over one billion people has put enormous pressure on this natural wealth. The need for economic development is balanced, however, by the Chinese people's long-standing love and appreciation of natural beauty. China has already established over 500 nature reserves, including some of the largest in the world, and these are highlighted in Wild China.</p>"

America In The Fifties And Sixties: Julián Marias On The United States,['Julian Marias'],"<p>With this one-volume, English-language presentation of two of his books on the United States, the Spanish philosopher Julián Marias joins the ranks of those foreign intellectuals and travelers who have made significant commentaries on our developing society.</p>
<p>Such writers as Alexis de Tocqueville, Frances Trollope, Frederick Marryat, Charles Dickens, Harriet Martineau, James Bryce, and Denis Brogan have examined the American forest when our own writers have been detained among its trees. In forcing us to look at ourselves through their eyes, they have brought about major breakthroughs in our understanding and perception of ourselves.</p>
<p>Rather than reiterating that the United States is a place dominated by modernity, by invasion of private life, and by aggressive materialism, Marias is charmed by ""the flavor of age"" he finds permeating the country, surprised by its ""essential loneliness,"" and impressed by the basic spirituality of the American people who, in contrast to the Europeans, have already begun to reach a point of saturation in their desire for material goods. For our contemporary image of ourselves as a harassed nation, Marias offers consolation by reminding us of aspects of the national life we tend to forget and which other foreign commentators have found it convenient to ignore.</p>"
"Atom And The Fault: Experts, Earthquakes And Nuclear Power",['Rl Meehan'],"<p>With wit and thoughtful compassion, Richard Meehan presents one of the most perplexing of contemporary moral predicaments, one that arises in every attempt to assess potentially hazardous technologies. He focuses on the longrunning controversy over suspected earthquake faults near the nation's first corporately owned nuclear test reactor at Vallecitos,California, and uses this account of ""the politics of expertise"" to probe the nature of scientific truth and its relationship to the determination of public safety.At Vallecitos, Meehan points out,the opinions of the ""experts"" were radically divided. Where one group saw clear and ominous evidence of an earthquake fault in trenches dug at this showpiece site, others saw only the mark of an ancient landslide. How did these experts arrive at their opinions? Were they simply representing corporate, as opposed to environmentalist, points of view? And how are the public regulatory agencies charged with deciding such issues supposed to balance these seemingly irreconcilable opinions? The Atom and the Fault explores these crucial questions as the issue of the earthquake safety of nuclear power plants continues to grow into a struggle encompassing government regulatory bodies, public utilities, private industry, engineers, geologists, and citizen activists. It paints candid portraits of the principal expert players, clarifies the difficult and often delicate interplay of honesty and loyalties among them, and lucidly explains the technical issues and viewpoints involved.As a professional participant in several environmental controversies in which so-called scientific facts were represented by opposing points of view, Meehan is uniquely qualified to tell this tale. He is a consultant to industry, government agencies, and law firms specializing in forecasting and damage assessment related to earthquakes and land failures, and an adjunct professor in the Values, Technology, Science, and Society program at Stanford University. His first book, Getting Sued and Other Tales of the Engineering Life was published by The MIT Press in1981.</p>"

Wondergenes: Genetic Enhancement And The Future Of Society,['Maxwell J. Mehlman'],"<p>Wondergenes not only imagines a future world in which genetic enhancement is the norm, but asserts that this future has already begun. Genetically engineered substances are already in use by athletes, in vitro fertilization already provides the primitive means by which parents can ""select"" an embryo, and the ability to create new forms of genetically engineered human beings is not far off. What happens when gene therapy becomes gene enhancement? Who will benefit and who might be left behind? What are the costs to our values and beliefs, and to the future of our society? To answer these questions, Maxwell J. Mehlman provides an overview of the scientific advances that have led to the present state of genetic enhancement and explains how these advances will be used in the future to redefine what we think of as a normal human being. He explores the ethical dilemmas already facing researchers and medical practitioners, and the dilemmas we will all be expected to face. In his forecast of the dangers inherent in this technology, he is particularly concerned with the emergence of a ""genobility"" made up of those able to afford increasingly expensive enhancement.</p>
<p>Wondergenes is a serious, accessible introduction to the social and personal implications of genetic engineering. Mehlman weighs the social and economic costs of the many proposals to regulate or limit genetic engineering and provides six concrete policy recommendations—from professional licensing to a ban on germ-line enhancement—that propose to make the future of genetic enhancement more equitable and safe.</p>"

Useless Arithmetic: Why Environmental Scientists Can't Predict the Future,"['Orrin H. Pilkey', 'Linda Pilkey-Jarvis']","<p>Writing for the general reader and using examples from the environmental sciences, Orrin Pilkey and Linda Pilkey-Jarvis show how unquestioned faith in mathematical models can blind us to the hard data and sound judgment of experienced scientific fieldwork. They begin with the extinction of the North Atlantic cod on the Grand Banks of Canada, and then they discuss the limitations of many models across a broad array of crucial environmental subjects. Case studies depict how the seductiveness of quantitative models has led to unmanageable nuclear waste disposal practices, poisoned mining sites, unjustifiable faith in predicted sea level rise rates, bad predictions of future shoreline erosion rates, overoptimistic cost estimates of artificial beaches, and a host of other problems. The authors demonstrate how many modelers have been reckless, employing fudge factors to assure correct answers and caring little if their models actually worked.</p>"

License To Thrill: A Cultural History Of The James Bond Films,"['Chapman, James.']","007's signature conversation opener has become indelibly stamped on our cultural memory. So too have the visual images from twenty films--the Bond silhouette in the opening credits striding across the screen, then abruptly turning cameraward to fire his gun; the calculating smirk of Sean Connery and his heirs in their roles as England's foremost Secret Service agent; and, of course, the ritualistic ordering of the ""shaken, not stirred"" martini. The most popular movie series in movie history, the Bond narrative has adjusted to changing times for four decades without ever abandoning a tried-and-true recipe of diabolical international conspiracy, sexual intrigue, and a battery of gadgetry worthy of Batman's tool belt.
<p> Licence to Thrill is an incisive analysis of the Bond film oeuvre, examining the fictional star and the series built around his escapades. As James Chapman investigates celluloid Bond, he explores the origins of the films in lan Fleming's novels, locates them in the spy thriller genre, discusses the Bond formula, and situates the suave British secret agent's adventuring within film history and film culture. Relating the evolution of the series to changes within the film industry, the broader culture of Britain, and international relations, Licence to Thrill legitimates the Bond legacy in the realm of film criticism, rehabilitating an immensely popular series that has been woefully neglected by specialists of popular culture.</p>"

A Century Of Recorded Music: Listening To Musical History,['Mr. Timothy Day'],"A century of recording has fundamentally changed our experience of music—the way we listen to it and the way it is performed. This highly engaging book is the first thorough exploration of the impact of recording technology upon the art of music. Timothy Day chronicles the developments in recording technology since its inception and describes the powerful effects it has had on artistic performance, audience participation, and listening habits. He compares the characteristics of musical life one hundred years ago—before the phonograph—to those of today and offers a fascinating analysis of how performing practices, images of performers, the work of composers, and performance choices in concert halls and opera houses have changed.
<p>The book investigates the work of such great recording engineer-impresarios as Fred Gaisberg and Walter Legge; the recording history of conductors, orchestras, and soloists throughout the century; and the development of the great classical recording labels. Day also addresses a variety of questions raised by the study of recordings: What have people expected of a recorded performance? Do recordings constitute an art form in their own right? What is historical authenticity? What is moral authenticity? Are recordings that endow incompetent artists with flawless techniques somehow fraudulent? Why do artists re-record repertoire? This book will inform and engage a wide range of readers, from those who love music and recordings to performers and scholars and all readers with an interest in the social and artistic history of the twentieth century.<br>

"After The Fall: The Demeter-persephone Myth In Wharton, Cather, And Glasgow",['Josephine Donovan'],"A continuation of Josephine Donovan's exploration of American women's literary traditions, begun with New England Local Color Literature: A Women's Tradition, which treats the nineteenth-century realists, this work analyzes the writing of major women writers of the early twentieth century--- Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, and Ellen Glasgow.<br>
The author sees the Demeter-Persephone myth as central to these writers' thematics, but interprets the myth in terms of the historical transitions taking place in turn-of-the-century America. Donovan focuses on the changing relationship between mothers and daughters--- in particular upon the ""new women's"" rebellion against the traditional women's culture of their nineteenth-century mothers (both literary and literal). An introductory chapter traces the male-supremacist ideologies that formed the intellectual climate in which these women wrote.<br>
Reorienting Wharton, Cather, and Glasgow within women's literary traditions produces major reinterpretations of their works, including such masterpieces as Ethan Frome, Summer, My Antonia, Barren Ground, and others.<br>
Josephine Donovan's books include Feminist Theory: The Intellectual Traditions of American Feminism; New England Local Color Literature: A Women's Tradition; and Sarah Orne Jewett. She is on the faculty of the University of Maine."

Plato's Universe,"['Vlastos, Gregory.']","A distinguished Platonic scholar discusses the impact of the Greek discovery of the ""cosmos"" on man's perception of his place in the universe, describes the problems this posed, and interprets Plato's response to this discovery.<br>
<br>
Starting with the Presocratics, Vlastos describes the intellectual revolution that began with the cosmogonies of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes in the sixth century B.C. and culminated a century later in the atomist system of Leucippus and Democritus. What united these men was that for all of them nature remained the inviolate, all-inclusive principle of explanation, precluding any appeal to a supernatural cause or ordering agency.<br>
<br>
In a detailed analysis of the astronomical and physical theories of the Timaeus, Vlastos demonstrates Plato's role in the reception and transmission of the discovery of the new conception of the universe. Plato gives us the chance to see that movement from a unique perspective: that of a fierce opponent of the revolution who was determined to wrest from its brilliant discovery, annex its cosmos, and redesign it on the pattern of his own idealistic and theistic metaphysics.<br>

Gift of Barbed Wire,['Robert S. McKelvey'],"A Gift of Barbed Wire is a penetrating look at the lives of South Vietnamese officials and their families left behind in Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975. A former Marine who served in Vietnam, Robert McKelvey went on to practice psychiatry and, through his work in refugee camps and U.S. social service organizations, met South Vietnamese men from all walks of life who had been imprisoned in re-education camps immediately after the war. McKelvey's interviews with these former political prisoners, their wives, and their children reveal the devastating, long-term impact of their incarceration. From the early years in French colonial Vietnam through the Vietnam War, from postwar ordeals of re-education, social ostracism, and poverty to eventual emigration to the United States, this collection of narratives provides highly personal accounts of individuals and families evolving against the backdrop of war and vast social change. Some of the people interviewed for the book eventually reached the United States as boat people fleeing Vietnam in unsafe vessels; others arrived, after rigorous screening, through U.S. Government-sponsored programs. But even in the safety of the United States they had to begin anew, devoting all of their remaining energies to survival. While crediting the courage and resilience of these families, McKelvey holds a critical mirror up to our culture, exploring the nature of our responsibility to our allies as well as the attitudes that obscured the reality of war as a grinding, brutal interplay of complex forces that often develops a sustaining energy and momentum of its own, driving us in directions that we neither anticipated nor desired."
Raven and the Rock : Storytelling in Chukotka,['Kira Van Deusen'],"A girl marries a whale, and her story reminds the Siberian Yupik about humans' relationship with the animals who sustain them. A reindeer herder spends the winter in a bear's den, and his story shows the Chukchi how despair can become courage. For centuries, native Chukchi and Yupik elders in Chukotka, the northeasternmost part of Siberia, have spent endless winter nights recounting tales of the trickster Raven, of how people and places came to be created, of evil spirits and sorcerers, of transformation and magic. Through storytelling, they taught the history, worldview, beliefs, and morals of Chukchi and Yupik people.<p>Storyteller and folklorist Kira Van Deusen has collected traditional Chukchi and Yupik folktales from present-day Chukotka, where indigenous people are reclaiming their traditions and identity after years under the assimilative forces of Soviet policy. In this book she presents 25 tales and legends in English translation.</p><p>These are old tales retold in modern settings. Their themes reveal much about contemporary concerns at a time when native Siberians are facing extreme economic hardships. They convey the values tellers admire and wish to pass on: the courage not to give up, wisdom and loyalty, the ability to find good in what appears evil, maintenance of good relationships with animals, and a sense of humor.</p><p>Together these tales provide a cross section of an oral tradition that is very much alive. Van Deusen grounds the stories in details of the tradition from which they spring, emphasizing what is unique in Chukchi and Yupik culture.</p>"

A Manifesto For Literary Studies (short Studies From The Walter Chapin Simpson Center For The Humanities),['Marjorie Garber'],"A Manifesto for Literary Studies, writes Marjorie Garber, ""is an attempt to remind us of the specificity of what it means to ask literary questions, and the pleasure of thinking through and with literature. It is a manifesto in the sense that it invites strong declarations and big ideas, rather than impeccable small contributions to edifices long under construction."" Known for her timely challenges to the preconceptions and often unquestioned boundaries that circumscribe our culture, Garber's beautifully crafted arguments situate ""big public questions of intellectual importance"" - such as those of human nature and historical correctness - within the practice of literary historians and critics. This manifesto revives the ancient craft whose ultimate focus is language in action. In this book, Garber passionately concludes that ""the future importance of literary studies - and, if we care about such things, its intellectual and cultural prestige both among the other disciplines and in the world - will come from taking risks, and not from playing it safe."""

A Nation Of Adversaries: How The Litigation Explosion Is Reshaping America,['Patrick M. Garry'],"A Nation of Adversaries: How the Litigation Explosion Is Reshaping America brilliantly examines why our culture has been increasingly crowding courthouses and fueling the growth of the lawyer population, pitting us against each other. Dr. Patrick Garry, an expert on the effect of the courts on American society, insightfully points out that our growing litigant-oriented mindset is reinforcing a self-centered culture of undue expectation and entitlement. The workplace, the classroom, the bedroom, and even the playground are becoming more combative. With increasing gridlock, acrimony, and ideological warfare, the political arena has especially come to resemble more a courtroom than an arena for concordance. The values supporting democracysuch as compromise and consensus - have been subverted by tenacity and aggressiveness. In light of the new litigation democracy, the individual's right to sue is valued more than his or her right to vote. The author also analyzes how the publicity bestowed upon specific lawsuits ""teaches"" the public to identify and assert new ways of being a victim. As a result, employees are victims of their employers, children victims of their parents, and students victims of their teachers. In encouraging new types of victim-plaintiffs and promising lucrative rewards to potential victims, litigation also fuels the fire of therapy culture. For a society obsessed with psychic healing and emotional recovery, litigation is seen as a logical continuation of the healing process begun in a therapist's office. Increasingly open to novel theories of psychological injuries, the courts are reinforcing the therapeutic bent so prevalent in sensationalistic talk shows and recovery programs. A Nation of Adversaries is a candid look at litigation's invasion into our once formally mindful society, and is a shrewd commentary on the creation of a new culture of identity in America."

Gouverneur Morris: an independent life,"['Adams, William Howard.']","A plainspoken, racy patrician who distrusted democracy but opposed slavery and championed freedom for all minorities, an important player in the American Revolution, later an astute critic of the French Revolution, Gouverneur Morris remains an enigma among the founding generation. This comprehensive, engrossing biography tells his robust story, including his celebrated love affairs during his long stay in Europe. Morris's public record is astonishing. One of the leading figures of the Constitutional Convention, he put the Constitution in its final version, including its opening Preamble. As Washington's first minister to Paris, he became America's most effective representative in France. A successful, international entrepreneur, he understood the dynamics of commerce in the modern world.

23 Days In July: Inside Lance Armstrong's Record-breaking Tour De France Victory,['John Wilcockson'],"A riveting day-by-day account of the 2004 Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's unprecedented sixth victory-by the man ""widely considered to be the best cycling writer in the U.S."" (USA Today)
<p>Taking place over twenty-three days in July and across more than 2,100 miles of smooth blacktop, rough cobblestones, and punishing mountain terrain, the Tour de France is the most grueling sports event in the world. And in 2004, five-time champion Lance Armstrong set out to achieve what no other cyclist in the 100-year history of the race had ever done: win a sixth Tour de France.</p>
<p>Armstrong had four serious challengers who wanted nothing more than to deny the man the French call Le Boss from achieving his goal. The major threat among them was the only other former Tour de France champion in this year's race, Germany's Jan Ullrich-The Kaiser. But there were also Armstrong's former teammate the ill-fated Tyler Hamilton, the talented young Italian Ivan Basso, and the Basque with movie-star looks Iban Mayo.</p>
<p>When the race was over, Lance Armstrong once again wore the yellow jersey of victory.</p>
<p><i>23 Days in July</i> is much more than a day-by-day recap of each stage in this historic Tour. Renowned cycling writer John Wilcockson serves up engaging pieces of race history with vivid descriptions of locales-from the Alps to the Pyrenees to Paris-as he describes the mental as well as physical battle between Armstrong, Ullrich, Hamilton, Basso, and Mayo. Woven into the narrative are the compelling personal stories of Armstrong and his major competitors and an insider's look at their pre-Tour strategy and training regimens, all lending new insight into the human side of the Tour de France. And the book places Armstrong's extraordinary achievement in an historic perspective through interviews with the legendary Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx, the man who came closest to winning six Tours before Armstrong; the Tour de France race director Jean-Marie Leblanc; and Armstrong's personal coach Chris Carmichael.</p>
<p> <i>23 Days in July</i> unforgettably captures the personal passion, rich history, diverse geography, and nationalistic fervor of the world's most demanding, rigorous, and dramatic athletic event.</p>"

Planet Simpson: How A Cartoon Masterpiece Defined A Generation,['Chris Turner'],"A smart, accessible and funny cultural analysis of <i>The Simpsons</i>, its inside stories and the world it reflects.
<p>From Bart Simpson to Monty Burns, the Internet boom to the slow drowning of Tuvalu, <b>Planet Simpson</b> explores how one of the most popular shows in television history has changed the way we look at our bewildering times. Award-winning journalist Chris Turner delves into the most esoteric of <i>Simpsons</i> fansites and on-line subcultures, the show’s inside jokes, its sharpest parodies and its ongoing love-hate relationship with celebrity to reveal a rarity of literary accomplishment and pop-cultural import — something never before achieved by a cartoon.</p>
<p>Complementing its satirical brilliance, <i>The Simpsons</i> boasts a beloved cast of characters, examined here in playful and scrupulous detail: Homer, selfish, tyrannical and not too bright, but always contentedly beholden to his family; Bart, pre-teen nihilist and punk icon; Lisa, junior feminist crusader; and Marge, archetypical middle-American mother, perpetually dragging her family kicking and screaming to higher moral ground. And while the voice actors behind the regular cast have eschewed celebrity, Turner considers why a stunning host of guests — Hollywood icons and has-beens, politicians, professional athletes, poets and pop stars — have submitted themselves to the parodic whims of the <i>Simpsons</i>’ writers.</p>
<p>Intelligent and rambunctious, absorbing and comic, <b>Planet Simpson</b> mines this modern cultural institution for its imaginative, hilarious, but always dead-on, reflections on our world.</p>

<p><b>Three Fun Facts About “D’oh!”</b><i><br>
<b>1.</b> The Oxford English Dictionary defines “d’oh” as “Expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish.”</i></p>
<p><i><b>2.</b> The origins of “D’oh!” A Tracey Ullman–era Simpsons script called for Homer to respond to an unfortunate turn of events thus: “[annoyed grunt].” Dan Castellaneta, the voice-actor who plays Homer, improvised the exclamation, “D’oh!” It stuck.</i></p>
<p><i><b>3.</b> The godfather of “D’oh!” Dan Castellaneta freely admits that he lifted Homer’s famous yelp from James Finlayson, a Scottish actor who played a bald, cross-eyed villain in a number of Laurel &amp; Hardy films in the 1930s. Finlayson’s annoyed grunt was a more drawn-out groan — Doooohhh! Castellaneta sped it up to create Homer’s trademark.</i></p>"

A touch of the poet: & More stately mansions,"[""O'neill, Eugene , 1888-1953""]","A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions are regarded as two of Eugene O'Neill's finest plays. Companion pieces, linked by characters and themes, they form part of a projected series of eleven interconnected plays in which the playwright intended to give a psychological and economic account of American life. Now these works, the only surviving plays in O'Neill's ""Cycle,"" are brought together for the first time in a paperback volume. The version of More Stately Mansions presented here is O'Neill's unexpurgated text, scrupulously edited by Martha Gilman Bower, which restores the playwright's original opening scene, a crucial epilogue, and other material essential to our understanding of the play."

The Orton Diaries,['Joe Orton'],"”To be young, good-looking, healthy, famous, comparatively rich <i>and</i> happy is surely going against nature.” When Joe Orton (19331967) wrote those words in his diary in May 1967, he was being hailed as the greatest comic playwright since Oscar Wilde for his darkly hilarious <i>Entertaining Mr. Sloane</i> and the farce hit <i>Loot</i>, and was completing <i>What the Butler Saw;</i> but less than three months later, his longtime companion, Kenneth Halliwell, smashed in Orton’s skull with a hammer before killing himself. <i>The Orton Diaries</i>, written during his last eight months, chronicle in a remarkably candid style his outrageously unfettered life: his literary success, capped by an <i>Evening Standard Award</i> and overtures from the Beatles; his sexual escapades—at his mother's funeral, with a dwarf in Brighton, and, extensively, in Tangiers; and the breakdown of his sixteen-year ""marriage"" to Halliwell, the relationship that transformed and destroyed him. Edited with a superb introduction by John Lahr, <i>The Orton Diaries</i> is his crowning achievement."
The Summer Of Her Baldness: A Cancer Improvisation,"['Lord, Catherine , 1949-']","“No eyebrows. No eyelashes. When it rains the water will run straight down into my eyes,” Catherine Lord wrote before her hair fell out during chemotherapy. Propelled into an involuntary performance piece occasioned by the diagnosis of breast cancer, Lord adopted the online persona of Her Baldness—an irascible, witty, polemical presence who speaks candidly about shame and fear to her listserv audience. While Lord suffers from unwanted isolation and loss of control as her treatment progresses, Her Baldness talks back to the society that stigmatizes bald women, not to mention middle-aged lesbians with a life-threatening disease.<br>
 In this irreverent and moving memoir, Lord draws on the e-mail correspondence of Her Baldness to offer an unconventional look at life with breast cancer and the societal space occupied by the seriously ill. She photographs herself and the rooms in which she negotiates her disease. She details the clash of personalities in support groups, her ambivalence about Western medicine, her struggles to maintain her relationship with her partner, and her bemusement when she is mistaken for a “sir.” She uses these experiences—common to the one-in-eight women who will be diagnosed at some point with breast cancer—to illuminate larger issues of gender signifiers, sexuality, and the construction of community."

Abe Fortas: A Biography,"['Kalman, Laura , 1955-']","Abe Fortas was a New Dealer, a sub-cabinet official, the founder of an eminent Washington law firm, a lose adviser to Lyndon Johnson, and a Supreme Court justice. Nominated by Johnson to be Chief Justice, he was rejected by Congress and resigned from the Court early in the Nixon administration under a cloud of impending scandal. This engrossing book-the first full biography of Abe Fortas-tells his dramatic story.<br>
<br>
Drawing on Fortas's previously unavailable personal papers, on numerous archives, and on extensive interviews with his family and associates, Laura Kalman, a historian and lawyer illuminates Fortas's evolution from New Dealer to Washington lawyer to Great Society liberal, and in so doing also provides a unique view of American liberalism from the 1930s through the 1960s. <br>
<br>
""There was no single Abe Fortas,"" writes Kalman. ""There was a variety of personae, and Fortas moved comfortably from one to another."" <br>
<br>
Kalman describes Fortas's various personae:<br>
<br>
The boy who as ""Fiddlin' Abe"" played the violin in dance bands to earn spending money and who grew to consider chamber music the love of his life; <br>
The Jew who cared more about Israel than Judaism; <br>
The civil libertarian who worked for irascible Harold Ickes as Under Secretary of the Interior during the New Deal, who defended those charged with disloyalty by Joseph McCarthy, and who promoted social justice on the Court; <br>
The urbane corporate lawyer whose friends became clients and whose clients became friends; <br>
The brilliant legal tactician who secured Lyndon Johnson's Senate seat in 1948 and whose successful defense of the Gideon case was described by William O. Douglas as ""the best singleargument"" he heard in all his years on the Supreme Court; <br>
The Supreme Court justice who willingly risked compromising his judicial integrity to advise President Johnson; <br>
The man who hobnobbed with the powerful yet was powerless to combat the attacks against him when he was a Supreme Court justice, and whose resignation from the Court contributed to the destruction of the liberal agenda for social reform.<br>
Reflecting on the various aspects of Fortas's enigmatic personality and the events of his life, Kalman creates a new portrait of the man that is more insightful and complete than any yet published. Engagingly written and superbly researched, this is the authoritative account of Fortas and the legal and political history he helped to shape."
Teaching Hospitals And The Urban Poor,['Eli Ginzberg'],"Academic health centers (AHCs) have played a key role in propelling the United States to world leadership in technological advances in medicine. At the same time, however, many of these urban-based hospitals have largely ignored the medical care of their poor neighbors. Now one of the leading experts in American health policy and economics ponders whether current and proposed changes in the financing and delivery of medical care will result in a realignment between AHCs and the poor.Basing his discussion on an analysis of the nation's twenty-five leading research-oriented health centers, Eli Ginzberg and his associates trace the history of AHCs in the twentieth century. He claims that AHCs are once again moving toward treating the poor because these hospitals need to admit more Medicaid patients to fill their empty beds, and their medical students need opportunities to practice in ambulatory sites. He also assesses some of the more important trends that may challenge the AHCs, including financial concerns, changing medical practice environments, and the likelihood of some form of universal health insurance.
<p>Author Biography: Eli Ginzberg is director of The Eisenhower Center for Conservation of Human Resources, Columbia University.

"Three Architects From The Master Class Of Otto Wagner: Emil Hoppe, Marcel Kammerer, Otto Schönthal",['Iain Boyd Whyte'],"Adolf Loos, Josef Hoffmann, and Otto Wagner have been widely acclaimed in recent celebrations of turn of the century Viennese art, architecture, and furniture design. But until now little has been known about the other architects who gave meaning to the term ""Viennese style."" This collection of drawings and sketches by Otto Wagner's three most gifted students provides a fascinating new source of documentary material on the early modern period. Published for the first time, the drawings include projects and executed designs ranging from apartment houses to villas, furniture, textiles and glassware, and achieve a graphic quality that has rarely been equaled.
<p>Emile Hoppe, Marcel Kammerer, and Otto Schonthal were the outstanding students in Otto Wagner's special class at the Akademie in Vienna - the famous Wagnerschule - and upon graduation were invited to join his studio, where they collaborated on some of his most important projects before establishing their own firm in 1909. The works presented here mark a climax in Viennese architectural design in which a highly developed consciousness is combined with the structural and material innovations characteristic of the Wagnerschule. The drawings are noteworthy not only for their intrinsic qualities, but also as a rich source of inspiration and a refreshing vocabulary for contemporary architects and designers.</p>
<p>An extended essay by Iain Boyd Whyte on the three architects' development and practice accompany this exciting catalog of drawings. Whyte is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and has written extensively on 20th-century German architecture, including the book <i>The Crystal Chain Letters: Architectural Fantasies by Bruno Taut and His Circle.</i></p>"

Borneo Log: The Struggle For Sarawak's Forests,['William W. Bevis'],"After a year as exchange professor at a Tokyo university, William Bevis spent part of the next year traveling in Sarawak, a Malaysian state located on the northern part of the island of Borneo. About the size of New York, it has a population of 1.7 million people living, outside of a few towns, in a world of jungle and brown rivers. There the rainforest is being cut rapidly, local corruption and greed siphon off most of the profit, native rights and land uses are being obliterated, and much of the fine timber is shipped to Japan to become plywood forms for concrete that are thrown away after two uses. This book is a travel narrative and also a serious environmental study of exploitation of third-world resources. During his stay in Sarawak, the author lived with both native activists and timber camp managers, seeking to understand the motives and actions of Japanese companies, Chinese entrepreneurs, and the native population most affected by the timber trade. Borneo Log is not simply a book about environmental politics in a far-away place. The power of the book lies in the author's extraordinary ability to bring home the related global disasters of the destruction of the world's rainforests and its indigenous peoples. This is a personal and passionate account of how ordinary men and women are fighting to defend a way of life that is rapidly disappearing along with their country's resources, and how the problems of their lives echo in our own."
Economic Development And Women In The World Community,"['Kartik C. Roy', 'Clement A. Tisdell', 'Hans C. Blomqvist']","After reviewing theories about how women are likely to fare as a result of economic development, the editors and their contributors focus on the socioeconomic status of women and changes in it as a result of processes of economic development in individual countries in five continents. Economic development is supposed to remove impediments to the improvement in women's status. In some developing countries researchers have found that instead of lessening the forces of restrictions, economic development may, in fact, have strengthened them. The editors call for a greater involvement of women as active participants in the process of dismantling social, legal, and institutional barriers to women's development."
Against the Tide: The Battle for America's Beaches,"['Cornelia Dean', 'Juan J.

With harrowing accounts of natural disasters, lucid explanations of the physics of the beach and coastal ecology, reports of unwise construction, and a clear-eyed elucidation of public policy and conservation issues, this book illustrates in rich detail the conflicting interests, short-term responses, and long-term imperatives that will shape the future of the American coast.                        <p>A New York Times Book Review Notable Book of the Year; Library Journal, Honorable Mention for Best Book of the Year; Delta Kappa Gamma Society Educator's Award 2000; American Association for the Advancement of Science, Best Books and Films of 1999; ;</p>"
"Agrippina: Sex, Power, And Politics In The Early Empire",['Anthony A. Barrett'],"Agrippina the Younger attained a level of power in first-century Rome unprecedented for a woman. According to ancient sources, she achieved her success by plotting against her brother, the emperor Caligula, murdering her husband, the emperor Claudius, and controlling her son, the emperor Nero, by sleeping with him. Modern scholars tend to accept this verdict. But in his dynamic biography-the first on Agrippina in English-Anthony Barrett paints a startling new picture of this influential woman.
<p>Drawing on the latest archaeological, numismatic, and historical evidence, Barrett argues that Agrippina has been misjudged. Although she was ambitious, says Barrett, she made her way through ability and determination rather than by sexual allure, and her political contributions to her time seem to have been positive. After Agrippina's marriage to Claudius there was a marked decline in the number of judicial executions and there was close cooperation between the Senate and the emperor; the settlement of Cologne, founded under her aegis, was a model of social harmony; and the first five years of Nero's reign, while she was still alive, were the most enlightened of his rule. According to Barrett, Agrippina's one real failing was her relationship with her son, the monster of her own making who had her murdered in horrific and violent circumstances. Agrippina's impact was so lasting, however, that for some 150 years after her death no woman in the imperial family dared assume an assertive political role.</p>"
The Cassell dictionary of slang,"['Green, Jonathon , 1948-']","All types of slang terms and expressions are included: criminal jargon, the language of sex, drink and drugs, slang associated with different ways of life, insults, swear words and expletives, rhyming slang and back slang. They are drawn from a vast range of sources, oral and written, and from all parts of the English-speaking world, from London to the Bronx and from Australia to South Africa. In every case, Jonathon Green painstakingly supplies a wealth of annotation and background detail. He explains precisely what each slang word or phrase means, where it originated, when it was first coined and whether it is still in use. He draws the reader's attention to comparable words and expressions. And, wherever possible, he traces the often tortuous routes by which slang words evolved and then either became common currency or faded away. Throughout, he conveys a sense of the vibrancy of slang, its wit and humour, and the fascinating insights it offers into the attitudes and obsessions of successive generations. In effect, his dictionary provides over 65,000 snapshot views of the life and development of a language and of the very varied cultures that nourish it."
Clouds: Biography Of A Country House,['Caroline Dakers'],"Almost before it was completed in 1886, Clouds was being described as 'the house of the age'. Designed by Philip Webb, one of Britain's greatest architects, this country house in Wiltshire was commissioned by Percy and Madeline Wyndham, an aristocratic couple with a sophisticated taste in design. In this handsomely illustrated book Caroline Dakers tells the story of Clouds: its planning and creation; the art commissioned to adorn its walls; the activities and interests of the three generations of Wyndhams who lived in it; the famous people who visited it; the sale of the house in the 1930s; and its eventual transformation into a charitable institution. Dakers vividly recreates the lives and personalities of Clouds' colourful owners. Percy and Madeline Wyndham were at the heart of late Victorian cultural life, and their guests were talented writers and artists such as Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, John Singer Sargent, Leighton, Whistler, and Watts. The Wyndhams' eldest son George, Secretary of State for Ireland and tipped as a future prime minister, died tragically early at the age of 49. For his nephew, Dick, the last Wyndham to own Clouds, economic forces had turned the 'palace of art' into a vast white elephant. The unique collection of art treasures was divided and sold, the estate broken up, and the house dynamited to a more convenient size. The book not only shows the significance of Clouds within the history of architecture, art, and design, but also uses the house to trace the changing relation between patrons and artists and the decline of the political and economic power of the landed class. A tale of achievement and tragedy, the story of Clouds chronicles an era of moneyed taste and leisure probably unparalleled this century."
"Capitol Women: Texas Female Legislators, 1923-1999","['Jones, Nancy Baker.']","Along with bar rooms and bordellos, there has hardly been a more male-focused institution in Texas history than the Texas Legislature. Yet the eighty-six women who have served there have made a mark on the institution through the legislation they have passed, much of which addresses their concerns as citizens who have been inadequately represented by male lawmakers.
<p>This first complete record of the women of the Texas Legislature places such well-known figures as Kay Bailey Hutchison, Sissy Farenthold, Barbara Jordan, Irma Rangel, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Susan Combs, and Judith Zaffirini in the context of their times and among the women and men with whom they served. Drawing on years of primary research and interviews, Nancy Baker Jones and Ruthe Winegarten offer concise biographies and profiles of all eighty-six women who have served or currently hold office in the Texas Legislature.</p>
<p> The biographies describe the women lawmakers' lives, campaign strategies, and legislative successes and defeats. Four introductory essays provide historical and cultural context for the biographies, which are arranged chronologically to give a sense of the passage of time, of relationships among and between women, and of the issues of their eras.</p>"
Strategies For Change: The Future Of French Society (organization,['Michel Crozier'],"Although Crozier's specific focus in this book is on the workings and nonworkings of French society, the essence of his analysis is valid for all advanced societies in their search for revitalization and strategies for change. Indeed, his opening chapter addresses ""The Crisis of Western Society"" and its increasing complexity, uncertainty, and anarchy, and later passages in the book will strike American readers as pertinent to their own recent and ongoing political debates.
<p><i>The Future of French Society</i> expresses a spirited opposition to the practices and goals of the bureaucracy-its enthusiasm for indiscriminate regulation, its passion for monopolizing power, its craze for self-aggrandizement and special privileges. It identifies the three main sources impeding change in French society: the systems of education, public administration, and recruitment of leaders. The book then proposes strategies for change that are strictly anti-utopian and self-limiting, thus avoiding the opposing extremes of centralized technocracy and revolution.</p>
<p>Michel Crozier is Director of the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations in Paris, and one of the world's leading authorities on modern social organization. The book is the second volume in the MIT Press Series on Organization Studies, edited by John Van Maanen.</p>"
"Boys Together: English Public Schools, 1800-1864","['Chandos, John.']","Although English public schools project an image of clean, polite, and uniformed boys living together in collective worship of God, team games, and academic standards, the early years of these schools had a reality that was far different. The public school that existed before the Clarendon Commission reforms of 1862-64 was a jungle inhabited by a warlike tribe of self-governing boys, into whose social, sporting, and moral lives the masters were not admitted. Boys were chiefly educated by street fighting, poaching, and rioting, and, according to the political enemies of the schools, acquiring a taste for liquor and ""a passion for female society of the most degraded kind.""<br>
In this engrossing book, John Chandos examines the public schools in the last half century before their reform. Using journals, letters, and autobiographies of the time, he provides revealing anecdotes about all aspects of public school life-from academics and sports to vice, discipline, fagging, and religion. Chandos not only illuminates the harsh treatment boys experienced but also shows why parents continued to commit their sons to this system. Parents were persuaded-the fathers usually from personal experience-that the public schools gave a realistic preparation for the wicked and treacherous world that lay ahead, and that a boy who had weathered the ordeal of a public school was a confirmed survivor. <br>
Boys Together is essential reading for students of life and values in nineteenth-century England; it is also enthralling entertainment for the general reader."
The Quiet Revolution: Central Banking Goes Modern,['Alan S. Blinder'],"Although little noticed, the face of central banking has changed significantly over the past ten to fifteen years, says the author of this enlightening book. Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System and member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, shows that the changes, though quiet, have been sufficiently profound to constitute a revolution in central banking.<p>Blinder considers three of the most significant aspects of the revolution. The first is the shift toward transparency: whereas central bankers once believed in secrecy and even mystery, greater openness is now considered a virtue. The second is the transition from monetary policy decisions made by single individuals to decisions made by committees. The third change is a profoundly different attitude toward the markets, from that of stern schoolmarm to one of listener. With keenness and balance, the author examines the origins of these changes and their pros and cons.</p>"
Controlling Environmental Policy: The Limits Of Public Law In Germany And The United States,"['Rose-ackerman, Susan.']","Although many people feel that Germany provides a model for environmental policymaking, this book shows that it does not. German administrative law, which focuses on individuals' complaints against the state for violating their rights, does not deal adequately with the broad issues of democratic legitimacy and accountable procedures raised in American courts. Susan Rose-Ackerman compares regulatory law and policy in the United States and Germany and argues that the American system can provide lessons for those seeking to reform environmental policymaking in Germany and the newly democratic states of eastern Europe. Democratic governments, says Rose-Ackerman, face the problem of balancing the desires and expertise of conflicting interest groups, such as those that concern themselves with environmental protection. Under German law, however, environmental associations with policy agendas have no enforceable legal right to participate in federal policymaking, and regulation writing is much less open and accountable than in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court is moving in the direction of the German system - away from review of the rulemaking process and toward a focus on individual rights. Those who support this trend should look critically at the German solution."
A History Of Ukraine,['Paul Robert Magocsi'],"Although the new state of Ukraine came into being as one of many formed in the wake of the Revolution of 1989, it is hardly a new country. Paul Robert Magocsi tells its story from the first millennium before the common era to the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1991, with a balanced discussion of political, economic, and cultural affairs."
Origins Of The Bill Of Rights,['Leonard W. Levy'],"Americans resorted to arms in 1775 not to establish new liberties but to defend old ones, explains constitutional historian Leonard W. Levy in this history of the origins of the Bill of Rights. Unencumbered by a rigid class system, an arbitrary government, or a single established church squelching dissent, colonial Americans understood freedom in a far more comprehensive and liberal way than the English, Levy shows. He offers here a panoramic view of the liberties secured by the first ten amendments to the Constitution - a penetrating analysis of the background of the Bill of Rights and of current legal understandings of each of its provisions."
Legends In Their Own Time: A Century Of American Physical Scientists,"['Serafini, Anthony.']","America's scientific giants of the 20th century have transformed the world in terms of scientific understanding, military preparedness, and the quality and comfort of our daily lives. In this exquisitely written book, Anthony Serafini - a respected historian and philosopher of science - regales the reader with vivid descriptions of the lives and contributions of the men and women who explored the depth of molecular structure, relativity, astronomy, quantum mechanics, nuclear research, and much, much more. These evocative and stunning portrayals of some of the greatest scientists who ever lived delve into the personalities and opinions of these pioneers. Furthermore, Serafini makes their significant discoveries accessible and meaningful to everyone. You will meet the indefatigable Lee De Forest, whose passion for wireless telegraphy resulted in the Audion Radio Tube, which broadcasted radio to thousands of America's living rooms. The roster of distinguished scientists continues with Ernest Lawrence, who began his academic career with the hope of becoming a physician. He later succumbed to the enticement of physics, becoming the first to discover how to unleash the unimaginable power within the nucleus. This discovery ultimately led to the creation of the atomic bomb. In addition, Robert Millikan astounded the scientific community by measuring the charge of an electron and convincing even the most hardened skeptics of the validity of the atomic theory of matter. Legends in Their Own Time recounts the most exciting events that took place during the Manhattan Project. It also explores the ongoing search for a Unified Field Theory of the cosmos - a goal that eluded even Albert Einstein. Serafini traces the evolution of scientists in America from a group of lackluster journeymen to world-renowned professionals, rivaling the scientific titans of Europe. This perceptive author portrays how the combination of politics and war has ironically contributed to the advancemen"
Amulets Of Ancient Egypt,['Carol Andrews'],"Amulets are ornaments believed to endow the wearer by magical means with the properties they represent. They were first made in Egypt as early as 4000 BC and were essential adornments for both the living and the dead. Crafted from gold and silver, semiprecious stones, and less valuable materials, they are fine examples of Egyptian art as well as a source of evidence for religious beliefs. In this book, Carol Andrews offers the first comprehensive account of the types of amulets made, their symbolism, and their protective powers. An amuletic foot could be worn to ensure fleetness of foot, a hand for dexterity. The desert-dwelling hare symbolized keenness of the senses, and the hedgehog, which hibernated and survived outside the fertile valley, held connotations of rebirth and triumph over death itself. The ubiquitous amulet in the shape of the dung beetle, known as a scarab, was symbolic of new life. Amulets in the image of powerful gods would be worn for protection, and malevolent creatures, like the male hippopotamus, would be worn to ward off the evil they represented. Both a reference book and an informative account of Egyptian magical belief, this is the most complete survey of the subject to date."

Computer chips will be inserted into the nervous systems of both the author, a professor of Cybernetics, and his wife. The experiment is to determine if emotions such as intoxication, anger, lust, can be read by the computer in terms of patterns of nervous excitement. Can these recorded emotions be beamed back to the chip in the body and experienced all over again? Will the emotions be communicable between two people – if one feels desire in New York, will the other be able to feel it in London? Will it change forever what it means to be human?"

The last cannibals,"['Basso', 'Ellen B.']","An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper XingÃº society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society.<br> This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent.<br> From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.                        <p>Third book in a series on Kalapalo narrative discourse uses nine stories collected between 1967-82 to interpret Kalapalo history.

For more than 50 years Kaufmann has studied this famous American architect - as a member of the Taliesin Fellowship, as a participant in the building of Fallingwater (perhaps Wright's best known work it was inherited by the author), and as a writer, editor, and teacher.
<p>Collected here for the first time, Kaufmann's essays provide an in depth investigation of particular aspects of Wright's works and ideas. They are amply documented by texts and drawings, many of which have been unexamined until now.</p>
<p>The essays begin with an unexpected view of Wright's Froebel kindergarten training, which he acknowledged as having awakened his delight in the play of color and design Kaufmann then takes up Wright's initial exposure to a great concept of architecture in Louis Sullivan's office. He examines the nature of Wright's break from the Prairie School, his attitude toward precedents in architecture, his responses to the machine and to idealistic modernism as conceived around the 1930s, the impact on Wright of the Great Depression, and Wright's evolution toward an architecture of space and of unique integral ornamentation—both crucial contributions to a humane architecture of the future.</p>"
Ernest Flagg: Beaux-arts Architect And Urban Reformer (architectural History Foundation Book),['Mardges Bacon'],"Architect of the United States Naval Academy, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Scribner Building, and model tenement houses, Ernest Flagg (1857-1947) advanced the cause of classicism while demonstrating a deep concern for architecture's social responsibility. This study of one of the most innovative practitioners of the Beaux-Arts movement in America covers Flagg's early training and Beaux-Arts works, his town and country houses, his commercial and utilitarian buildings, the Singer Tower (which established a new height record while setting a precedent for New York City skyscraper restrictions in scale and density), urban housing reform, and his small houses of modular design.
<p>Flagg, the author notes, combined French nineteenth century aesthetics and the principles of academic classicism with American structural technology to create significant buildings during the Progressive Era from 1890 to 1917. His contributions to zoning and height regulations were essential to New York's first laws governing this aspect of the city's architecture. A confirmed individualist, Flagg produced highly original writings and ingenious inventions for construction techniques in low-cost housing and railroad cars.</p>
<p>Flagg's adaptation of classicism and his concern for urban contextualism make this study of his work particularly timely. His designs have immediate relevance for contemporary architects and preservationists, as well as those interested in the social and architectural history of New York City.</p>

Solar Building Architecture (solar Heat Technologies),"['Anderson, Bruce']","Architectural integration was a rapidly maturing area of solar technology when federal funding was abruptly shut off in the early 1980s. This book clearly chronicles the exciting development of the variety of approaches that were explored and describes those that succeeded and which are being used today.
<p><i>Solar Building Architecture,</i> provides a useful summary of the successes and failures of both federally sponsored and private efforts to use solar technology in conjunction with the design of individual buildings and with overall urban planning. In particular, it focuses on a road not taken - the integration of solar techniques into the planning of communities.</p>
<p>Following a general overview, <i>Solar Building Architecture</i>, looks at the effect of solar thinking on site planning for individual buildings and communities. It covers the challenges in using natural energy systems in building design, including such areas as building envelopes, thermal energy storage, and thermal energy distribution in building interiors. It also discusses the integration of natural energy techniques into the overall design of smaller, envelope-dominated buildings and larger, interior load-dominated structures.</p>

"Fatherhood Politics In The United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, And Marriage",['Anna Gavanas'],"Are fathers being marginalized in the contemporary family? Responding to fears that they are, the self-proclaimed ""fatherhood responsibility movement"" (FRM) has worked since the mid-1990s to put fatherhood at the center of U.S. national politics. Anna Gavanas's Fatherhood Politics in the United States analyzes the processes, reveals the internal struggles, and traces the myths that drive this powerful movement. Unlike previous investigations that rely on literary or other secondary sources, Fatherhood Politics works from primary ethnographic material to represent a wider range of voices and actors. Interacting with and interviewing members of the most powerful and well-known national fatherhood organizations, Gavanas observed Promise Keeper rallies, men's workshops, and conferences on masculinity, fatherhood, and marriage.
<p> Providing a detailed overview of the different organizations involved and their various rhetorical strategies, Gavanas breaks down the FRM into two major wings. The ""pro-marriage"" wing sees marriage as the key to solving all social problems, while the ""fragile family"" organizations worry about unemployment, racism, and discrimination. Gavanas uses her extensive anthropological fieldwork as the basis for discussions of gender, sexuality, and race in her analysis of these competing voices. Taking us inside the internal struggles, tensions, and political machinations of the FRM, Gavanas offers a behind-the-scenes look at a movement having real impact on current social policy. Fatherhood Politics is an essential work for anyone interested in the politics of masculinity, parenthood, marriage, race, and sexuality.</p>"
#NAME?,"['Perry, Richard John , 1942-']","Around the globe, people who have lived in a place ""from time immemorial"" have found themselves confronted by and ultimately incorporated within larger state systems. During more than three decades of anthropological study of groups ranging from the Apache to the indigenous peoples of Kenya, Richard J. Perry has sought to understand this incorporation process and, more importantly, to identify the factors that drive it. This broadly synthetic and highly readable book chronicles his findings.<br>
 Perry delves into the relations between state systems and indigenous peoples in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Australia. His explorations show how, despite differing historical circumstances, encounters between these state systems and native peoples generally followed a similar pattern: invasion, genocide, displacement, assimilation, and finally some measure of apparent self-determination for the indigenous people--which may, however, have its own pitfalls.<br>
 After establishing this common pattern, Perry tackles the harder question--why does it happen this way? Defining the state as a nexus of competing interest groups, Perry offers persuasive evidence that competition for resources is the crucial factor in conflicts between indigenous peoples and the powerful constituencies that drive state policies.<br>
 These findings shed new light on a historical phenomenon that is too often studied in isolated instances. This book will thus be important reading for everyone seeking to understand the new contours of our postcolonial world.<br>"
Two Early Tudor Lives: The Life And Death Of Cardinal Wolsey By George Cavendish; The Life Of Sir Thomas More By William Roper,"['George Cavendish', 'William Roper']","Around the year 1557, George Cavendish and William Roper fashioned masterful biographies of two figures who played major roles in the dramatic sequence of events that transformed the face of England. Each author knew his subject intimately; Cavendish served Wolsey as the Cardinal's gentleman usher, and Roper was More's son-in-law. Each biography has recently been edited from the manuscripts for the Early English Text Society, and the modernized versions presented here are based upon these authoritative editions."

The  Responsive Workplace,"['Sheila B. Kamerman', 'Alfred J. Kahn']","As the American workforce has changed in recent years to accommodate an increasing number of working parents, the workplace itself must also adapt. Sheila Kamerman and Alfred Kahn, two of the most respected authorities on work and the American family, explore in this study the ways in which the workplace has responded to social change. They examine the latest innovations in the workplace as well as enduring concerns -fringe benefits, day care and other services, and employers' policies at the workplace. And, they assess employers' adequacy in assisting parents of young children to manage simultaneously their work and family roles. In doing so, Kamerman and Kahn separate over-optimistic ""wish lists"" from reality, and mere claims of certain effects from observed results. They also look at some critical benefits and services in detail, delineating which are useful and practical . The authors consider whether a workplace-based pattern of provision will meet everyone's needs and, if not, what alternatives are possible. While endorsing a serious role for employers, they stress that government must also take a role in respect to families of working parents.<br>

"Visions Of Schooling: Conscience, Community, And Common Education","['Professor Rosemary C. Salomone', 'Rosemary C. Salomone']","At no time in the past century have there been fiercer battles over our public schools than there are now. Parents and educational reformers are challenging not only the mission, content, and structure of mass compulsory schooling but also its underlying premise -- that the values promoted through public education are neutral and therefore acceptable to any reasonable person. In this important book, Rosemary Salomone sets aside the ideological and inflammatory rhetoric that surrounds today's debates over educational values and family choice. She offers instead a fair-minded examination of education for democratic citizenship in a society that values freedom of conscience and religious pluralism. And she proposes a balanced course of action that redefines but does not sever the relationship between education and the state.
<p> Salomone demonstrates how contemporary conflicts are the product of past educational and social movements. She lays bare some of the myths that support the current government monopoly over education and reveals how it privileges those of economic means. Through a detailed case study of a recent controversy in a suburban New York school district, the author explores the legal and policy issues that arise when widely disparate worldviews stand in the way of political compromise on educational materials, techniques, and programs. Salomone builds a case for educational governance that places the developmental needs of the child at the center of family autonomy. She advances a plan that respects diverse values and visions of schooling while preserving the core commitments that bind our nation.</p>"
"Dutch Flower Painting, 1600-1720",['Mr. Paul Taylor'],"At the time of the great tulip speculation of the 1630s in Holland, the most desirable tulip bulbs were auctioned for more money than the most expensive houses in Amsterdam. At the same time flower paintings which were remarkable for their apparent realism were produced all over Holland and purchased by Dutch families as enduring substitutes for the real thing. This beautiful book reveals the fascinating genesis and growth of a whole genre of paintings that has rarely been studied. Paul Taylor begins by discussing Holland's 'tulipomania' and its effect on the way people thought about floral still lifes. He then considers the religious messages associated with the flower paintings, exploring how religious writers spoke of flowers as moral signposts from God and how some flower paintings were meant to remind viewers of the transience of earthly existence. Flower paintings were not bought only as records of luxury objects or for moral edification, however. They were also enjoyed as works of art, as masterpieces of illusion, composition and colour harmony, so Taylor analyses the art-theoretical writings of the time in order to understand how artists and connoisseurs responded to flower pieces. He concludes by analysing the paintings themselves, tracing the development and refinement of the actual practice of flower painting."
Black Business In The New South,['Walter B. Weare'],"At the turn of the century, the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company became the ""world's largest Negro business."" Located in Durham, North Carolina, which was known as the ""Black Wall Street of America,"" this business came to symbolize the ideas of racial progress, self-help, and solidarity in America. Walter B. Weare's social and intellectual history, originally published in 1973 (University of Illinois Press) and updated here to include a new introduction, still stands as the definitive history of black business in the New South. Drawing on a wide range of sources—including personal papers of the company's leaders and oral history interviews—Weare traces the company's story from its ideological roots in the eighteenth century to its economic success in the twentieth century."
The Gospel Of Gentility: American Women Missionaries In Turn-of-the-century China,"['Hunter, Jane , 1949-']","At the turn of the century, women represented over half of the American foreign mission force and had settled in ""heathen"" China to preach the lessons of Christian domesticity. In this engrossing narrative, Jane Hunter uses diaries, reminiscences, and letters to recreate the backgrounds of the missionaries and the problems and satisfactions they found in China. Her book offers insights not only into the experiences of these women but also into the ways they mirrored the female culture of Victorian America.<br>
""A subtle and finely written book... [on] an aspect of the mission world in China that has never before received such probing, affectionate, detailed treatment.""-Jonathan Spence, New York Review of Books<br>
""An important and often entertaining work....New angles on imperialism and gentility alike.""-Martin E. Marty, Reviews in American History<br>
""A triumph of sophisticated subtle intelligence. Though quite cognizant of the dark side of the confluence of American nationalism and the missionary enterprise, Hunter's interest is in moving beyond that understanding to explore how the meeting of two cultures affected, and was shaped by, a female angle of vision.""-Regina Morantz-Sanchez, Signs<br>
""Jane Hunter writes better than most novelists, and she has a topic more demanding and rewarding than the subjects many novelists deal with. Her story of the valiant and ofttimes guilt-ridden women who ventured to China, singly or with spouses, to win the country for Christ creates a world and beckons readers into it.""-Christian Century"
Disputes and democracy: the consequences of litigation in ancient Athens,"['Johnstone, Steven , 1959-']","Athenians performed democracy daily in their law courts. Without lawyers or judges, private citizens, acting as accusers and defendants, argued their own cases directly to juries composed typically of 201 to 501 jurors, who voted on a verdict without deliberation. This legal system strengthened and perpetuated democracy as Athenians understood it, for it emphasized the ideological equality of all (male) citizens and the hierarchy that placed them above women, children, and slaves.
<p>This study uses Athenian court speeches to trace the consequences for both disputants and society of individuals' decisions to turn their quarrels into legal cases. Steven Johnstone describes the rhetorical strategies that prosecutors and defendants used to persuade juries and shows how these strategies reveal both the problems and the possibilities of language in the Athenian courts. He argues that Athenian ""law"" had no objective existence outside the courts and was, therefore, itself inherently rhetorical. This daring new interpretation advances an understanding of Athenian democracy that is not narrowly political, but rather links power to the practices of a particular institution.</p>"

"A Sephardi Life In Southeastern Europe: The Autobiography And Journals Of Gabriel AriÃ , 1863-1939","['Benbassa', 'Esther']","Autobiographical texts are rare in the Sephardi world. Gabriel Arie's writings provide a special perspective on the political, economic, and cultural changes undergone by the Eastern Sephardi community in the decades before its dissolution, in regions where it had been constituted since the expulsion from Spain in 1492. His history is a fascinating memoir of the Sephardi and Levantine bourgeoisie of the time. For his entire life, Arie - teacher, historian, community leader and businessman - was caught between East and West. Born in a small provincial town in Ottoman Bulgaria in 1863, he witnessed the disappearance of a social and political order that had lasted for centuries and its replacement by new ideas and new ways of life, which would irreversibly transform Jewish existence. A Sephardi Life in Southeastern Europe publishes in full the autobiography (covering the years 1863-1906) and journal (1906-39) of Gabriel Arie, along with selections from his letters to the Alliance Israelite Universelle. An introduction by Esther Benbassa and Aron Rodrigue analyzes his life and examines the general and the Jewish contexts of the Levant at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries."
A Theory Of Good City Form,['Kevin Lynch'],"Available in paperback under the title <i>Good City Form</i>
<p>With the publication of <i>The Image of the City,</i> Kevin Lynch embarked on the process of exploration of city form. <i>A Theory of Good City Form,</i> his most important book, is both a summation and an extension of his vision, a high point from which he views cities past and possible.</p>
<p>The central section of the book develops a new normative theory of city form—an identification of the characteristics that good human settlements <i>should</i> possess. This follows an examination of three existing normative theories—those which see the city as a model of the cosmos, as a machine, and as a living organism—which are shown to be finally inadequate and unable to hold up under sustained analysis. In addition, an appendix demonstrates the inadequacies of a number of functional theories—those whose aim is simply to describe <i>how</i> settlements work rather than to evaluate how they ought to work. Among these theories are models of cities as ecological systems, as fields of force, as systems of linked decisions, or as areas of class conflict.</p>
<p>Lynch puts forth his own theory by searching out the qualities that produce good settlements, qualities that allow ""development, within continuity, via openness and connection."" He identifies five interrelated dimensions of performance—vitality, sense, fit, access, and control—and two ""meta-criteria,"" efficiency and justice. As in all of Lynch's writing, the theory flows from and leads back to specific examples and everyday realities. The final section of the book is concerned with applications of the theory.</p>"

52nd Street: The Street Of Jazz (da Capo Paperback),['Arnold Shaw'],"Back in the thirties and forties, when New York City was the capital of the jazz world—you could hail a cab, ask the driver to take you to ""The Street,"" and find yourself on 52nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Musicians, jazz lovers, college students, big businessmen—everybody knew that this was ""The Street that Never Slept,"" the Street where every night was New Year's Eve, the Street that <i>Variety</i> editor Abel Green so aptly dubbed ""America's Montmartre."" Here, for the price of a drink or two, you could walk through the whole history of jazz. Hot jazz was born and raised on The Street, as were the big swing bands of the thirties and the modern ""cool"" jazz combos of the forties. Comics like Alan King and Joey Adams got their start on the Street, as did musicians like Erroll Garner, Jack Teagarden, and Coleman Hawkins. Bessie Smith performed on the Street, and so did Count Basie, Charlie ""Bird"" Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Art Tatum, Sarah Vaughn, the Dorsey Brothers, Artie Shaw, and other jazz greats.Arnold Shaw was there—as musician, composer, PR man, and just plain listener—and he recreates for us the three swinging decades that were the history if the Street: its birth in Prohibition-era speakeasies, where musicians jammed for gin or just for the fun of it; its post-Repeal blossoming as the center of the jazz universe, lined up and down on both sides with tiny, smoke-filled rooms where black and white musicians played to capacity crowds; its postwar decline as the Street became a tawdy tenderloin of strip and clip joints."
"American Indians, American Justice","['Vine Deloria', 'Clifford M. Lytle']","Baffled by the stereotypes presented by Hollywood and much historical fiction, many other Americans find the contemporary American Indian an enigma. Compounding their confusion is the highly publicized struggle of the contemporary Indian for self-determination, lost land, cultural preservation, and fundamental human rights--a struggle dramatized both by public acts of protest and by precedent-setting legal actions. More and more, the battles of American Indians are fought--and won--in the political arena and the courts.<p>American Indians, American Justice explores the complexities of the present Indian situation, particularly with regard to legal and political rights. It is the first book to present an overview of federal Indian law in language readably accessible to the layperson. Remarkably comprehensive, it is destined to become a standard sourcebook for all concerned with the plight of the contemporary Indian.</p><p>Beginning with an examination of the historical relationship of Indians and the courts, the authors describe how tribal courts developed and operate today, and how they relate to federal and state governments. They define such key legal concepts as tribal sovereignty and Indian Country. By comparing and contrasting the workings of Indian and non-Indian legal institutions, the authors illustrate how Indian tribes have adapted their customs, values, and institutions to the demands of the modern world. Describing the activities of attorneys and Indian advocates in asserting and defending Indian rights, they identify the difficulties typically faced by Indians in the criminal and civil legal arenas and explore the public policy and legal rights of Indians as regards citizenship, voting rights, religious freedom, and basic governmental services.<br></p>"

Beauty And The Book: Fine Editions And Cultural Distinction In America,"['Benton, Megan.']","Beauty and the Book is a cultural history of the craze for fine books which began after WWI and ended with the Depression. Benton begins by describing the massive public demand for fine editions, and the anxieties about class, literacy and culture which this craze reflected. She goes on to tell the stories of a range of publishers (from Bennet Cerf at Random House to owners of small, private presses) who catered to this demand by producing absurdly expensive editions, whose prices were justified both by the materials used (vellum, gold leaf, etc.) and the labor intensive processes by which they were created. Ostensibly, these limited editions were an antidote to the rise of mass literacy, and the consequent decline in literary taste. Unlike cheap romances and magazines, these limited editions (usually of classic works) embodied a pre-industrial ideal of ""high"" culture. Using fine editions as a jumping off point, Benton highlights the many aspirations and investments that swirl around book reading and book buying. Particularly at time in which the book as physical object is being challenged by new technologies, Beauty and the Book describes an extreme version of the materialistic concerns and attachments that are always one aspect of book buying and reading."
Oology And Ralph's Talking Eggs: Bird Conservation Comes Out Of Its Shell,"['Henderson, Carrol L.']","Before modern binoculars and cameras made it possible to observe birds closely in the wild, many people collected eggs as a way of learning about birds. Serious collectors called their avocation ""oology"" and kept meticulous records for each set of eggs: the bird's name, the species reference number, the quantity of eggs in the clutch, the date and location where the eggs were collected, and the collector's name. These documented egg collections, which typically date from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, now provide an important baseline from which to measure changes in the numbers, distribution, and nesting patterns of many species of birds.<br>
 In Oology and Ralph's Talking Eggs, Carrol L. Henderson uses the vast egg collection of Ralph Handsaker, an Iowa farmer, as the starting point for a fascinating account of oology and its role in the origins of modern birdwatching, scientific ornithology, and bird conservation in North America. Henderson describes Handsaker's and other oologists' collecting activities, which included not only gathering bird eggs in the wild but also trading and purchasing eggs from collectors around the world. Henderson then spotlights sixty of the nearly five hundred bird species represented in the Handsaker collection, using them to tell the story of how birds such as the Snowy Egret, Greater Prairie Chicken, Atlantic Puffin, and Wood Duck have fared over the past hundred years or so since their eggs were gathered. Photos of the eggs and historical drawings and photos of the birds illustrate each species account. Henderson also links these bird histories to major milestones in bird conservation and bird protection laws in North America from 1875 to the present."
Roger Tory Peterson: A Biography,"['Carlson, Douglas , 1943-']","Beginning with his 1934 Field Guide to the Birds, Roger Tory Peterson introduced literally millions of people to the pleasures of observing birds in the wild. His field guide, which has gone through five editions and sold more than four million copies, fostered an appreciation for the natural world that set the stage for the contemporary environmental movement. When Rachel Carson's Silent Spring sounded a warning about the threat to birds and their habitats in the 1960s, the Peterson field guides had already prepared the public and the scientific community to heed the warning and fight to save habitat and protect endangered species--a result that Peterson wholeheartedly approved.<br>
 In this authoritative, highly readable biography of Roger Tory Peterson (1908-1996), Douglas Carlson creates a fascinating portrait of the complex, often conflicted man behind the brand name. He describes how Peterson's obsession with birds began in boyhood and continued throughout a multifaceted career as a painter, writer, educator, environmentalist, and photographer. Carlson traces Peterson's long struggle to become both an accomplished bird artist and a scientific naturalist--competing goals that drove Peterson to work to the point of exhaustion and that also deprived him of many aspects of a normal personal life. Carlson also records Peterson's many lasting achievements, from the phenomenal success of the field guides, to the bird paintings that brought him renown as ""the twentieth century's Audubon,"" to the establishment of the Roger Tory Peterson Institute to carry on his work in conservation and education."

Flink writes about the formation of an American automobile culture during the period from the introduction of the motor vehicle into the United States in 1895 to the opening of the Ford Motor Company's Highland Park plant on January 1, 1910. He concludes that Americans by 1910 were committed to automobility and that, with the development of a mass market for motorcars, the automobile industry in America had reached a critical turning point. From then on, the automobile and the automobile industry ""called the tune and set the tempo of modern American life.""
<p>In contrast to earlier historians of the automobile, Professor Flink avoids narrow concentration on the automobile industry and its product. He focuses instead on the automobile as a factor influencing and influenced by American civilization. The molding of a favorable public opinion of the automobile by the press, the growth of automobile clubs, the evolution of legislation intended to regulate the motor vehicle, the development of roads and services for the motorist, and regional, class, and occupational differences in automotive innovativeness—these are some of the topics that are dealt with adequately for the first time in this authoritative volume. Forty-six full-page illustrations augment the text.</p>
<p>Familiar topics are also viewed from a fresh perspective. Having made an exhaustive study of the automobile trade journals and popular periodicals of the period, Professor Flink was able to relate the developments in automotive technology and in the automobile industry to the sociocultural milieu within which these developments took place. He reaches some novel conclusions. He demonstrates, for example, that from the first the organization of the automobile industry and the industry's technological accomplishments lagged behind the public's expectations that a reliable, cheap car for the masses would soon appear and inaugurate a utopian horseless age. Well before Henry Ford came out with his legendary Model T, popular opinion of the automobile was overwhelmingly favorable, and many people thought that automobility was a panacea for society's ills.</p>
<p><i>America Adopts the Automobile, 1895-1910,</i> is the first comprehensive, scholarly account of the origins of the American automobile revolution. It adds a new dimension to our understanding of twentieth century American civilization.</p>"
Black Paris: The African Writers' Landscape,['Bennetta Jules-rosette'],"Black Paris documents the struggles and successes of three generations of African writers as they strive to establish their artistic, literary, and cultural identities in France.

"Llamas, Weavings, And Organic Chocolate: Multicultural Grassroots Development In The Andes And Amazon Of Bolivia",['Kevin Healy'],"Bolivia, like most developing countries around the world, strove for decades to imitate Western and particularly U.S. methods of development, importing the latest technologies, institutions, crops, and livestock. Finally, beginning in the 1970s, faced with many striking instances of failure in the application of the North American modernization paradigm, diverse sectors of Bolivian civil society turned inward to rediscover the country's own multicultural identities and agrarian wisdom as sources of strength upon which to build their own socioeconomic development. The shift spawned a proliferation of development projects grounded in a new ""indigenization"" or revitalization of cultural traditions. 
<p><i>Llamas, Weavings and Organic Chocolate: Multicultural Grassroots Development in the Andes and Amazon of Bolivia</i> is the story of Bolivian rural development and cultural change in three parts. Part I provides an overview of the history of rural development in Bolivia—the long history of anti-indigenous discrimination, the introduction of aid programs in the Western development paradigm, the rise of grassroots movements challenging this paradigm, and the array of initiatives now contributing to the revitalization of indigenous cultural resources. Part II consists of in-depth narratives of nine projects, giving an inside view of the processes that interweave cultural recuperation and developmental strategies. These stories illustrate the cultural barriers that must be overcome and the setbacks often faced by grassroots federations. The projects range from successful agro-exports such as organic chocolate and quinoa to the groundbreaking work of indigenous artists and artisans. In Part III, author Kevin Healy attempts to identify the numerous factors that helped engender successful outcomes in these projects and discusses the effects of globalization on Bolivian culture and development patterns.</p>
<p>This inspirational story of social change led by idealism will be valuable for international policy makers, analysts, and aid officials, as well as native North and South Americans, and non-Native Americans who strongly identify with their struggles.<br>

Confessions of a Concierge: Madame Lucie's History of Twentieth-Century France,['Bonnie G. Smith'],"Bonnie Smith weaves biography and oral history into this vivid life of Madame Lucie, concierge of a Paris [apartment building] and witness of nearly a century of French history. Both Smith and Madame Lucie are brilliant, flexible storytellers who present life as a continual flux between the poles of tradition and scandal, politics and private life, truth and memory. The garrulous and sometimes manipulative Madame Lucie seems more real than most subjects of biography and history; she steps out of these pages as full-bodied as a character in a novel. ---Ms."

The Gershwin Years: George and Ira,['Lawrence D.

Emperor Maximilian Ii,['Paula Sutter Fichtner'],"By virtually all standards, including his own, Emperor Maximilian II (1527–1576) was a failure. His challenges were many, his achievements few. So Paula Sutter Fichtner begins the introduction to this book, the first full biography in English of Maximilian. The Habsburg leader, though gifted, was never able to drive the Turks from Hungary, rationalize his government, or reunite Christendom or even its German components. By bringing the failures of Maximilian’s reign into clear focus, Fichtner illuminates the abilities and qualities of this complex man as well as the weaknesses of the expanded Habsburg empire and the problems of ruling in an age of confessional turmoil. Fichtner examines the dynamics of military, institutional, cultural, and family affairs in the early modern Habsburg empire and considers the reasons why Maximilian was unable to shape them to his own purposes. She describes a man of tolerant disposition who allowed Protestants free exercise of their religion yet struggled both publicly and privately with the difficult religious currents of his time. From her extensive research in the primary sources, she provides a fresh portrait of Maximilian, his role in Reformation history, and his era of war, religious division, political conflict, and administrative stress.

Cardinal De La Rochefoucauld: Leadership And Reform In The French Church,"['Bergin, Joseph , 1948-']","Cardinal Richelieu (1585-1642) did more than anyone else to lay the foundations of French hegemony in Europe and of absolute monarchy in his own country. He was a spokesman for power politics, the idea of raison d'etat, and the right of rulers to the unquestioning obedience of their subjects. He was, in addition, one of the richest men in the entire history of France. Joseph Bergin's study of his wealth-the first full-scale analysis of the fortune of a leading political figure of the ancien regime-reveals the multiple connections that existed at that time between the tenure of political office and the accumulation of individual and family wealth. 
<p>""Bergin's study of Richelieu's fortune achieves the unexpected feat of adding substantially to our knowledge of one of the most important figures in French history, largely through the exploitation of a group of hitherto unused documents. . . .

She was both the historian and the critic of her period ... in painting that has few rivals in her day or ours."" Yet today Stettheimer remains an oddity, known largely as an eccentric, upper-middle-class German-Jewish spinster who lived in New York with her two sisters and mother and who accomplished her best work when she was over fifty years old. In this book, Barbara Bloemink presents the first full account of Stettheimer's life and art, showing that her bold and inventive paintings provide biting social commentary on American culture of her period."
A–z Of Cat Health And First Aid: A Holistic Veterinary Guide For Owners,['Andrew Gardiner'],"Cats can be aloof, independent creatures, so when they fall ill or show signs of distress it can be particularly worrying for their owners. What should you do? Phone the vet immediately? Make a routine appointment? Or are there practical solutions which you can also carry out at home to alleviate your cat's discomfort? Keeping your cat fit and well can often be a matter of mutual cooperation` between vet and owner, and this clear and eminently sensible A-Z guide to cat's health shows that there is much that the owner can do in the way of first aid and nursing both before and after any treatment given by your vet. Andrew Gardiner is an experienced vet with an holistic approach and an advocate of complementary medicine. His introduction offers advice on how to keep a stock of remedies, both orthodox and homoeopathic, at home, what to do and how to handle your cat in the case of an accident, and how to administer treatments to a cunning cat, while the book itself gives detailed help on 220 common cat illnesses and worries, from accidents and anxiety to breathing difficulties, burns, coat contamination, feline leukaemia, fleas, lumps, overgrown nails, spaying, spraying and urination problems. Each entry explains the symptoms, tells you if the problem merits urgent attention, exactly what first aid and nursing care you can administer at home, homoeopathic remedies, the treatment the vet will administer, what aftercare should be given and other related symptoms and illnesses. This book will enable you to understand your cat's well-being better, and a thorough reading of its contents will give you a deep insight into your cat's health and behaviour. Its first aid sections will be especially useful when professional veterinary care is not readily available."
Celtic Myths,"['Aldhouse-green, Miranda J. (miranda Jane)']","Celtic Myths explores the mythology and beliefs of the pagan Celts between about 600 B.C. and A.D. 400. At their peak, the Celtic peoples inhabited a vast area of Europe, Great Britain, and Ireland. As non-literates, they have left no written record of their lives, their beliefs, and the stories which were such an important part of their culture; however, contemporary commentators from the Classical world, later Christian scribes recording oral traditions, and the archaeological evidence can give us fascinating, though fragmented, glimpses. Dr. Green draws on all these sources to discuss the myths and the religious beliefs and ritual which she believes inform them.<br>
 The heroic and magical tales of the Book of Invasions, the Fionn stories, the Ulster Cycle, and the Mabinogi are the subject of the first chapters. These stirring stories, though recorded in medieval times by Christian writers, preserve fascinating evidence of their pagan origins. Dr. Green then goes on to look at the evidence for Celtic religious beliefs and raises some interesting questions as to how far we can establish links and recognize common features between the story material and the archaeological record.<br>

Rebuilding Central Park: A Management And Restoration Plan,"['Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow , 1936-']","Central Park's legacy is unique. It was America's first great open space designed specifically for public use, inspiring the creation of hundreds of other municipal parks across the nation and spawning the profession of landscape architecture in the United States. This plan for the restoration, conservation, and management of the Park is the most comprehensive program of research, restoration, and management ever applied to a great historic landscape. It is significant in its broad concept of curatorship and provides a model for approaching and carrying out any work of scenic restoration; several of the projects it advocates to reverse the Park's steady decline are in progress or have already been completed.
<p>Illustrated throughout with 2-color and tinted maps and drawings and numerous photographs, <i>Rebuilding Central Park</i> is the first close examination of these invaluable 843 acres in more than a century. It unfolds a masterful design and management plan to overcome the effects of years of city budget cuts, natural aging, and human use and abuse.</p>
<p>The book opens with a discussion of the principles and philosophy of the original design by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux and a history of the Park's management. It assesses the Park's distinct but interrelated systems - circulation, topography, vegetation, and wildlife - and presents a sector-by-sector analysis of 21 project areas. Problems and their causes are discussed on every level as are proposals for solving them.</p>
<p>Sections of the book take up the restoration of such historic structures as the cast-iron bridges, stone arches and Victorian Gothic Belvedere and Dairy, which were features of the original Olmsted design; and the conservation of such varied landscapes as the Ramble, the East Meadow, the Great Hill, and Strawberry Fields. Maps reveal the kinds and pace of park activities, patterns of circulation - drives, paths, trails, lighting and visitor amenities - ground plans, vegetation, and historic and present tree canopy as well as the Park rebuilt. There are many recommendations, including recommendations for maintenance and security.</p>
<p>A separate chapter describes the methodology used for approaching and carrying out this, and any other, major work of landscape restoration.</p>

 Winner of the 1998 National Conference of Black Political Scientists Book Award; Winner of the 1998 C. Wright Mills Award, from the Society for the Study of Social Problems<br>
 This book chronicles the complex connections between race and class that have marked American social reform since the New Deal, revealing an aspect of the civil rights struggle that that has been too long overlooked or obscured: the struggle for policies to expand social and economic welfare for blacks and whites alike.<br>
 
<p>Documents that, contrary to popular misconception, the civil rights agenda is an American agenda and not African-American agenda. Organizations like the national Urban League and the NAACP have throughout their history labored to persuade this nation to live up to the edict in our Constitution that 'all men are created equal' and to honor the Preamble which calls upon government to 'promote the general welfare'. (Hugh B. Price, President, National Urban League)<br>
</p>
<p>The Hamiltons´ lucid study of the history of policy making in social welfare, from the New Deal to the present, is written from a black perspective and is meticulously researched and documented. Black civil rights organizations, seeking a universal social welfare system, jobs in the regular work force, and national hegemony over government programs, worked for policies that comprised a dual agenda: the pursuit of race-specific issues and the fight for a social welfare agenda that included all citizens regardless of race. Part of the story is that of the clash of the two agendas. . . . Highly recommended.(Choice)<br>

Child Witnesses: Fragile Voices In The American Legal System,"['Mcgough, Lucy S.']","Children are frequently called to testify in court in criminal prosecutions, divorce and child custody hearings, dependency abuse proceedings, and other disputes. But is their testimony reliable? This book carefully assesses research on the cognitive capabilities of children as well as the emotional, social, and moral influences that might affect children's potential reliability, and it recommends reforms in American legal processes that will protect child witnesses from trauma and ensure accurate testimony. Lucy S. McGough, a specialist in family law, examines the known developmental facts on perception, memory, and reporting that affect children's ability to serve as trial witnesses. She also analyzes many actual trials, including the McMartin Pre-School prosecution in California, the Morgan-Foretich custody and visitation controversy, and the five U.S. Supreme Court child sexual abuse cases, assessing how a child witness may be more prone to memory-fade, suggestibility, or fantasy than an adult witness. McGough also examines the legal processes and rules of evidence that affect how eyewitness accounts by children are received: trial processes for evaluating the credibility of witnesses; the hearsay rule and its exceptions; the Constitution's confrontation clause; and the use and abuse of expert witnesses. And she presents a proposal for the early videotaping of a child's eyewitness account in order to minimize the most serious potential reliability risks posed by child witnesses. The product of ten years of research and investigation, this book should help remedy the failure of American law to take into account all that we now know about the fragility of children's memories."

Regions And Resources: Strategies For Development,"['Kresge', 'David', 'Seiver', 'Daniel', 'Goldsmith', 'Oliver', 'Scott', 'Michael']","Citing decisions that show effective long-range planning policies, such as Alberta's Heritage Savings Trust Fund and Alaska's Permanent Fund, this book points out that even in our imperfect, non-self-regulating world, a state or region that is rich in valuable resources can design innovative policies that improve the welfare of residents and provide a cushion for boom and bust cycles of the future. It develops a general analytical description of a resource-based regional economy and uses that analysis to construct a model of a specific economy—Alaska—that can be used to evaluate current policy issues and aid planners in devising efficient and beneficial development plans for other resource-rich regions.
<p>The model is applied to Alaska's experience following development of its North Slope petroleum resources and projects trends of growth under different scenarios to the year 2000. The effects of specific policy actions such as direct distribution of oil revenues, income tax cuts, public investment programs, manpower training programs, local hire provisions, and subsidies for new industries are analyzed. And the question of what state and regional economies can do to exercise control over their own future through the use and conservation of their resources, is explored in a final chapter.</p>

An American Imperative: Accelerating Minority Educational Advancement,['Mr. L. Scott Miller'],"Closing the large educational gaps that exist between the majority population and several minority groups is increasingly important, owing to America's rapidly growing racial and ethnic diversity and the rising skill demands of our technological era. This book examines variations in minority and majority educational patterns, assesses underlying causes, and offers recommendations for increasing the rate of minority educational progress. L. Scott Miller argues that group educational advancement is an intergenerational process shaped by a complex interplay of economic, social, cultural, and institutional factors over time. The current generation of minority and majority students has very different amounts and mixes of home, school, and community resources to draw on, owing to divergent historical experiences and contemporary circumstances. A large-scale, long-term national effort is proposed to ensure that minorities reach educational parity with the majority as soon as possible."
Israel And The Bomb,"['Cohen, Avner , 1951-']","Cohen focuses on a two-decade period from about 1950 - 1970, during which David Ben-Gurion's vision of making Israel a nuclear-weapon state was realized. He weaves together the story of the formative years of Israel's nuclear program, from the founding of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission in 1952, to the alliance with France that gave Israel the sophisticated technology it needed, to the failure of American intelligence to identify the Dimona Project for what it was, to the negotiations between President Nixon and Prime Minister Meir that led to the current policy of secrecy. Cohen also analyzes the complex reasons Israel concealed its nuclear program -- from concerns over the Arab reaction and the negative effect of the debate at home to consideration of America's commitment to non-proliferation.

Re-made in Japan: everyday life and consumer taste in a changing society,"['Tobin', 'Professor Joseph J.']","Colonel Sanders, Elvis, Mickey Mouse, and Jack Daniels have been enthusiastically embraced by Japanese consumers in recent decades. But rather than simply imitate or borrow from the West, the Japanese reinterpret and transform Western products and practices to suit their culture. This entertaining and enlightening book shows how in the process of domesticating foreign goods and customs, the Japanese have created a culture in which once-exotic practices (such as ballroom dancing) have become familiar, and once-familiar practices (such as public bathing) have become exotic. Written by scholars in anthropology, sociology, and the humanities, the book ranges from analyses of Tokyo Disneyland and the Japanese passion for the Argentinean tango to discussions of the Japanese haute couture and the search for an authentic nouvelle cuisine japonaise. These topics are approached from a variety of perspectives, with explorations of the interrelations of culture, ideology, and national identity and analyses of the roles that gender, class, generational, and regional differences play in the patterning of Japanese consumption. The result is a fascinating look at a dynamic society that is at once like and unlike our own."

Pederasty And Pedagogy In Archaic Greece,['William Armstrong Percy Iii'],"Combining impeccable scholarship with accessible, straightforward prose, Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece argues that institutionalized pederasty began after 650 B.C., far later than previous authors have thought, and was initiated as a means of stemming overpopulation in the upper class. William Armstrong Percy III maintains that Cretan sages established a system under which a young warrior in his early twenties took a teenager of his own aristocratic background as a beloved until the age of thirty, when service to the state required the older partner to marry. The practice spread with significant variants to other Greek-speaking areas. In some places it emphasized development of the athletic, warrior individual, while in others both intellectual and civic achievement were its goals. In Athens it became a vehicle of cultural transmission, so that the best of each older cohort selected, loved, and trained the best of the younger. Pederasty was from the beginning both physical and emotional, the highest and most intense type of male bonding. These pederastic bonds, Percy believes, were responsible for the rise of Hellas and the ""Greek miracle"": in two centuries the population of Attica, a mere 45,000 adult males in six generations, produced an astounding number of great men who laid the enduring foundations of Western thought and civilization."

The Management Of Conflict: Interpretations And Interests In Comparative Perspective,['Marc Howard Ross'],"Complex social and political conflicts invariably have multiple roots rather than a single clear cause, and they are therefore difficult to manage effectively. Conflicts are about the interpretations of opponents' motives as well as the interests that antagonists pursue. Conflict management is most effective when it addresses not only the specific objects of contention but also adversaries' deeper, emotion-laden fears.
<p>Drawing on research and ideas delineated in his companion book, The Culture of Conflict, Marc Howard Ross offers a cross-cultural approach to conflict management. He identifies key features of constructive conflict management societies and evaluates three strategies of conflict management-self help, joint problem-solving, and third-party decision making-showing how each succeeds or fails in dealing with both disputants' interests and interpretations as causes of conflict. Exploring a wide variety of conflict management successes and failures-including the confrontation between MOVE and the city of Philadelphia, a public housing dispute in New York City, the return to warfare in post-colonial highland New Guinea, persistent hostility in Northern Ireland, and the Camp David Accords-Ross explains that how disputants' interests and interpretations are addressed affects the course of each dispute, its intensity, and the degree to which the dispute results in a constructive outcome. He offers the hypothesis that in bitter disputes modifying opponents' interpretations is a prerequisite for bridging differences in interests, stresses the need for models of successful conflict management, and suggests ways to expand constructive conflict management.</p>"

The Measurement Of Visual Motion (acm Distinguished Dissertation),['Ellen Hildreth'],"Computer scientists designing machine vision systems, psychologists working in visual perception, visual neurophysiologists, and theoretical biologists will derive a deeper understanding of visual function—in particular the computations that the human visual system uses to analyze motion—from the important research reported in this book.
<p>The organization of movement in the changing image that reaches the eye provides our visual system with a valuable source of information for analyzing the structure of our surroundings. This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial.</p>
<p>The author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation.</p>
<p><i>The Measurement of Visual Motion</i> is an ACM Distinguished Dissertation.</p>"
Building Lives: Constructing Rites and Passages,['Neil Harris'],"Conception and birth, growth and maturity, aging and death - these are important moments in the human life story. They are also stages in the existence of a building, says the author of this unconventional history of the rituals and practices that surround built structures in America. Drawing on sources as varied as Masonic manuals, promotional brochures, janitorial contracts, tourist guidebooks, and religious texts, the cultural historian Neil Harris explores the rites of building passage over the past one hundred and fifty years. In this generously illustrated volume, he offers new insights into the social and cultural roles of buildings."
Conquering High Blood Pressure: The Complete Guide to Manging Hypertension,"['Stephen Wood', 'Bert Griffith']","Conquering High Blood Pressure: The Complete Guide to Managing Hypertension is a remarkably comprehensive account of a common chronic illness affecting adults and children. Dr. Wood, a family and occupational medicine physician, and Mr. Griffith, a family medicine physician assistant, team up to clearly address many important issues, in particular the patient's role in co-managing his or her high blood pressure with a physician or other health care attendant; the important physical or emotional concerns of special at-risk groups (e.g., the elderly, African-Americans, children, and pregnant women); the potentially hazardous side-effects or interactions of the drugs used to treat high blood pressure; the tips to follow to become a savvy consumer of medications or devices to cope with hypertension; the invaluable role of family members and friends in helping the person cope with hypertension; and the relationship between high blood pressure and other chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol). Supported by compelling case histories and helpful appendixes, the authors' lucid explanation of the many facets of hypertension will enlighten and empower the millions of adults and children who suffer from this disease.                        <p>...clearly defines the scope and issues surrounding this common chronic illness that affects some 50 million adults &amp; 2 million children...a valuable reference for patients and medical professionals alike.</p>"
Rationing Medicine,['Robert A.

Blank traces four aspects of health care: organ transplantation, the treatment of seriously ill newborns, reproductive technologies, and fetal health.<br> <br>                        <p>In a timely and much-needed analysis, Robert Blank argues that the impending disaster in health care can be averted only by moderating public expectations and by emphasising lifestyle changes as a part of preventive health care.</p>"
Industrial Relations And Manpower In Construction,['Daniel Quinn Mills'],"Construction is one of the nation's most complex and important industries. In terms of employment, it is the largest single industry in the United States; yet there has been no reasonably comprehensive study of the labor market in construction since the 1920s. This work explores the sources of inflationary pressures in construction and the means of reducing them, attempting also to accurately reflect the enormous variety in this industry and in the relationships between contractors and their employees.
<p>The book is divided into four sections: <i>Collective Bargaining</i>—which describes the inflation that developed in the late 1960s; <i>Manpower Utilization</i>—including seasonality, manpower planning, and problems of racial imbalance; <i>Formal Training</i>—particularly apprenticeship; and <i>Problems of Public Policy</i>—especially in regard to housing.</p>
<p>The study ends early in 1971, at the time of the imposition of wage controls in construction. The author's thorough inquiry into a matter of national significance should lead to a better understanding of the industry and perhaps to a more stable full-employment sector of our economy.</p>"
The Challenge And Promise Of A Catholic University,['Theodore M. Hesburgh'],"Contemporary Catholic higher education finds itself at a crucial crossroad. The issues are many and complex. How is the Catholic character of the university to be preserved and fostered while avoiding secularization on the one hand and insular sectarianism on the other? Must a majority of the faculty in a college or department be Catholic? How is Catholic to be defined in terms of culture, belief, or practice? What is the level of commitment to intellectual inquiry and the possibility of dissent that must be present on a Catholic campus? These are some of the issues that prompted Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., to write a position paper and invite 29 distinguished members of the faculty and administration at the University of Notre Dame to address as they strive to envision and create a great Catholic university. The contributors explore these issues from a wide variety of religious and academic perspectives, and although their backgrounds and fields of study differ widely, they agree on a number of points. First, a great Catholic university must begin by being a great university that is also Catholic. Second, the catholicity, or universality, of a Catholic university fosters the centrality of philosophy and particularly theology as legitimate intellectual concerns, especially as they challenge the disintegration and turmoil of our modern predicament. Finally, how a Catholic university is seen as a community of service is also examined in both its intellectual and practical applications. Throughout, these essays describe a university community where reason and faith intersect and reinforce each other as they grapple with all the problems that face the transmission and growth of knowledge and the multiplication of new and complex moral problems."
Contemporary Desert Photography: The Other Side Of Paradise,"['Marilyn Cooper', 'Katherine Plake Hough']","Contemporary Desert Photography: The Other Side of Paradise, emphasizes the artist's view of the desert in a selection of visual woks. The differing viewpoints in these photographs provide us with a rich and deep experience and speak to the fragility of nature, to the sense of desolation, to the beauty of untouched land, to the ethereal quality of decaying structures, to the fleeting nature of perception, and to so many other ideas."

True Blue: The Carm Cozza Story,"['Carm Cozza', 'Rick Odermatt']","Cozza brings us behind the scenes for the famous 29-29 ""loss"" against Harvard in 1968; he recalls the antiwar protesters who were less than enthusiastic about a combat sport; and he marvels over the courage of 1989 captain Jon Reese, who played a game against Cornell with a broken jaw, enabling Cozza to win his tenth and last Ivy title. He tells stories about some of the outstanding men who played for him, among them Dick Jauron, Gary Fencik, Calvin Hill, Rich Diana, John Spagnola, Rudy Green, John Pagliaro, Kelly Ryan, Stone Phillips, and Jack Ford. He recounts how difficult it was to adhere to the highest standards of academic excellence and amateur purity while major college teams were lowering standards, abusing rules, and exploiting athletes in the quest for victories and revenue. And he offers thoughts on how Yale - and similar elite schools - can invigorate their football programs without succumbing to the excesses of the big-time conferences."
Building Cross-cultural Competence: How To Create Wealth From Conflicting Values,"['Mr. Charles M. Hampden-turner', 'Mr. Fons Trompenaars']","Cross-cultural competence is a skill that has become increasingly essential for the managers in multinational companies. For other business people, this kind of competence may spell the difference between surviving and perishing in the new global economy. This book focuses on the dilemmas of these managers and offers constructive advice on dealing with culture shock and turning it to business advantage. Opposing values can be understood as complementary and reconcilable, say Charles Hampden-Turner and Fons Trompenaars. A manager who concentrates on integrating rather than polarizing values will make much better business decisions. Furthermore, the authors show, wealth is actually created by reconciling values-in-conflict.
<p>Based on fourteen years of research involving nearly 50,000 managerial respondents and on the authors' extensive experience in international business, the book compares American cultural values to those of more than forty other nations. It explores six culture-defining dimensions and their reverse images (universalism-particularism, individualism-communitarianism, specificity-diffusion, achieved status-ascribed status, inner direction- outer direction, and sequential time-synchronous time) and discusses them as alternative ways of coping with life's—and business's—exigencies. With humor, cartoons, and an array of business examples, the authors demonstrate how the reconciliation of cultural differences can cause whole organizations to grow healthier, wealthier, and wiser.<br>

José Lezama Lima's Joyful Vision: A Study Of Paradiso And Other Prose Works (texas Pan American Series),['Gustavo Pellón'],"Cuba's José Lezama Lima became the most controversial figure in the flowering of the Latin American novel with the 1966 publication of Paradiso. Hailed as a seminal writer of breathtaking originality by Julio Cortázar, Octavio Paz, and Mario Vargas Llosa, Lezama was also attacked by the Castro regime and others for his stylistic obscurity, erotic descriptions, and violation of literary norms. Indeed, his experimental fiction, written on the very boundaries of the novelistic genre, resists classification. José Lezama Lima's Joyful Vision, a much-needed critical study of Paradiso, Oppiano Licario, and Lezama's essays, is thus an exploration in reading, one that highlights and preserves the essential and persistent contradictions in Lezama's theory and practice of literature.
<p>Gustavo Pellón focuses his study on Lezama's search for equilibrium, clarifying such oppositions in Lezama's writings as the mystical quest for illumination through obscurity, the calculated cultivation of naïveté, the Proust-like fascination with yet ultimate condemnation of homosexuality, and a modernist (even postmodernist) narrative style that conveys a mystical (essentially medieval) worldview. Above all, Pellón shares his wonder at Lezama who, in an age of pessimism, maintained his joyful vision of art and existence.<br>

"We the Poor People: Work, Poverty, and Welfare","['Yeheskel Hasenfeld', 'Joel F. Handler']","Current welfare reforms-including recently enacted federal legislation-are largely symbolic politics, argue two experts in this important new book. According to Joel F. Handler and Yeheskel Hasenfeld, the real problem we face is not the spread of welfare but the spread of poverty among the working poor, a group that includes most welfare recipients. The surest way to solve the problem is to create jobs and supplement low-wage work. The authors offer proposals that would make it possible for individuals to support themselves and their families through working and that would establish a safety net for those relatively few individuals who are unable to do so.<br>The authors discuss current policies, efforts, and programs designed to deal with the poor and analyze what works, what does not work, and why. Instead of income maintenance strategies, they promote policies that would facilitate leaving welfare for work-particularly in the case of single mothers. Their proposals range from creating jobs and supplementing income through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to raising the minimum wage to providing health insurance and child care support. These are not inexpensive solutions, but they must occur if we truly wish to live in a society that strives to provide opportunities for all."
Talking With Young Children About Adoption,"['Mary Watkins', 'Dr. Susan Fisher M.d.']","Current wisdom holds that adoptive parents should talk with their child about adoption as early as possible. But no guidelines exist to prepare parents for the various ways their children might respond when these conversations take place. In this wise and sympathetic book, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist, both adoptive mothers, discuss how young children make sense of the fact that they are adopted, how it might appear in their play, and what worries they and their parents may have. Accounts by twenty adoptive parents of conversations about adoption with their children, from ages two to ten, graphically convey what the process of sharing about adoption is like.<br>"

Imagining Literacy: Rhizomes Of Knowledge In American Culture And Literature,['Ramona Fernandez'],"Defining the ""common knowledge"" a ""literate"" person should possess has provoked intense debate ever since the publication of E. D. Hirsch's controversial book Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know. Yet the basic concept of ""common knowledge,"" Ramona Fernandez argues, is a Eurocentric model ill-suited to a society composed of many distinct cultures and many local knowledges.<br>
 In this book, Fernandez decodes the ideological assumptions that underlie prevailing models of cultural literacy as she offers new ways of imagining and modeling mixed cultural and non-print literacies. In particular, she challenges the biases inherent in the ""encyclopedias"" of knowledge promulgated by E. D. Hirsch and others, by Disney World's EPCOT Center, and by the Smithsonian Institution. In contrast to these, she places the writings of Zora Neale Hurston, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Leslie Marmon Silko, whose works model a cultural literacy that weaves connections across many local knowledges and many ways of knowing.<br>"
Democratic Justice,['Ian Shapiro'],"Democracy and justice are often mutually antagonistic ideas, but in this innovative book Ian Shapiro shows how and why they should be pursued together. Justice must be sought democratically if it is to garner legitimacy in the modern world, he claims, and democracy must be justice-promoting if it is to sustain allegiance over time. Democratic Justice meets these criteria, offering an attractive vision of a practical path to a better future. 
<p>Wherever power is exercised in human affairs, Shapiro argues, the lack of democracy will be experienced as injustice. The challenge is to democratize social relations so as to diminish injustice, but to do this in ways that are compatible with people's values and goals. Shapiro shows how this can be done in different phases of the human life cycle, from childhood through the adult worlds of work and domestic life, retirement, old age, and approaching death. He spells out the implications for pressing debates about authority over children, the law of marriage and divorce, population control, governing the firm, basic income guarantees, health insurance, retirement policies, and decisions made by and for the infirm elderly. This refreshing encounter between political philosophy and practical politics will interest all those who aspire to bequeath a more just world to our children than the one we have inherited.</p>"
Industrial Democracy At Sea: Authority And Democracy On A Norwegian Freighter,['Robert Schrank (ed.)'],"Democratization of the workplace is a much vaunted goal in European countries, especially Scandinavia. But can it be achieved? Do increased participation and autonomy improve the quality of work life? Can productivity be increased this way? These questions form the basis for the evaluations in this book, a case study of the experimental democratization of working life aboard the Norwegian freighter, the <i>Hoeg Mallard.</i>
<p>The book presents the accounts of three American merchant seamen who were taken on as crew members for the course of a voyage from the Pacific Northwest to Europe. Their reactions and adjustments to democracy at sea were observed and recorded by a fourth American, reporter Sidney Roger. One of Roger's findings was that despite more open mixing among ranks, having a voice in work-detail operations, and being able to use such cruise-ship amenities as swimming pool, sauna, library, and bar, the seamen's life aboard ship appeared to be as dull and unrewarding as it was on more autocratic and less lavishly appointed merchant vessels.</p>
<p>Robert Schrank relates these on-the-job observations to the general issues of industrial democracy and five scholars have contributed essays responding to the experiences recounted by Sidney Roger. These essays are by Richard E. Walton (Harvard Business School), William F. Whyte (New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations), Einar Thorsrud (Work Research Institutes, Oslo), Birger Viklund (Center for the Study of Working Life, Stockholm), and Shoshana Zuboff (Harvard Business School).</p>

Deregulation And The New Airline Entrepreneurs (regulation Of Economic Activity),"['John R. Meyer', 'Clinton V. Oster  Jr.']","Deregulation in the airline industry has spurred a major growth in entrepreneurs competing with established carriers. This book takes a close look at the phenomenon in two areas—commuter airlines using small propeller-driven aircraft to offer scheduled short-haul service in low density markets, and jet-equipped carriers like the now familiar Southwest Airlines, New York Air, and People's Express, offering simple, no-frills service and low fares in short to medium hauls.
<p><i>Airline Deregulation</i> focuses in particular on how these two relatively new segments of the industry will eventually be structured, and their impact on the rest of the industry. It points out that already, in their present structure, these carriers have played significant roles in rationalizing service to small communities, broadening the range of fare and service offerings, improving productivity, and lowering cost structures.</p>
<p>Chapters cover opportunities in a deregulated industry, entrepreneurial opportunities before deregulation, the demand for short-haul air service and its cost structure, commuter airline safety, financial strategies, competitive strategies of new entrant jets, and of commuters, airport congestion and new entrant access, small community service and the role of Federal subsidy, and airline industry structure and public policy.</p>

Continuum Electromechanics,['James R. Melcher'],"Designed to be used as a graduate-level text and as an engineering reference work, <i>Continuum Electromechanics</i> presents a comprehensive development of its subject—the interaction of electromagnetic forces and ponderable media, the mechanical responses to electromagnetic fields, and the reciprocal effects of the material motions produced by those fields. The author's approach is highly interdisciplinary, and he introduces fundamental concepts from such subjects as electrohydrodynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, electron beam engineering, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and physical chemistry.
<p>The applications of continuum electromechanics are also remarkably diverse, and many of them are treated in the book, both because of their intrinsic engineering importance and as a means of illustrating basic principles. Among these applications are the design of rotating machines and synchronous generators, polymer processing, magnetic melting and pumping in metallurgical operations, the processing of plastics and glass, the manufacture of synthetic fibers, inductive and dielectric heating, thermal-to-electrical energy conversion, the control of air pollution, the design of controlled-fusion devices, image processing and printing, the magnetic levitation and propulsion of vehicles, the study of films and membranes, and the analysis of the complex electrokinetic and physicochemical processes that underlie the sensing and motor functions of biological systems. Many of these applications are presented in the form of problems.</p>
<p>The book consists of eleven chapters, entitled Introduction to Continuum Electromechanics; Electrodynamic Laws; Approximations, and Relations; Electromagnetic Forces, Force Densities, and Stress Tensors; Electromechanical Kinematics; Energy-Conversion Models and Processes; Charge Migration, Convection, and Relaxation; Magnetic Diffusion and Induction Interactions; Laws, Approximations, and Relations of Fluid Mechanics Statics and Dynamics of Systems Having a Static Equilibrium; Electromechanical Flows; Electromechanics with Thermal and Molecular Diffusion; and Streaming Interactions.</p>"

This new edition of the Handbook furthers the goal of integrating developmental processes into the search for adequate categorical systems for understanding child mental health problems and the trajectories that lead to adult psychopathology. The editors respond to contemporary challenges to place individual behavior in a biological and social context. By including a range of approaches, this volume encompasses the complexity of the growing developmental literature. At the same time, it includes the most recent efforts to produce concise child diagnostic categories. In a thoroughgoing revision of the first edition of this classic text and reference, published by Plenum in 1990, the editors have assembled a distinguished roster of contributors to address such topics as issues and theories; context and mental health; biology and mental illness; disorders of early childhood; disruptive behavior disorders; emotional disorders; control disorders; pervasive developmental disorders; and trauma disorders. Clinicians, researchers, and students in such diverse fields as developmental and clinical psychology, child and adolescent psychiatry, social work, and educational and counseling psychology will benefit from the concepts, investigations, and challenges presented in this state-of-the-art compendium."
Contracts In Trade And Transition: The Resurgence Of Barter,"['Marin, Dalia.']","Difficulties in contract enforcement impede international transactions in the world economy and domestic transactions in transition economies. In <i>Contracts in Trade and Transition</i>, Dalia Marin and Monika Schnitzer explain how barter as an economic institution can facilitate contract enforcement across national borders in international trade and within borders in transition countries. The authors show that international countertrade--tying an export to an import--emerged in the 1980s in response to the international debt crisis when Western creditors refused to finance imports to developing countries and Eastern Europe. Barter--the exchange of goods without the use of money--reemerged in transition economies in the 1990s in response to a domestic debt crisis when banks in transition countries were reluctant to provide finance to firms. Countertrade and barter introduce a deal-specific form of collateral that addresses the lack of creditworthiness of countries and firms.
<p> Drawing on contract theory, the authors argue that parties might want to pay in goods rather than cash or link an export with an import as in countertrade to solve incentive problems that otherwise would prevent any trade from taking place. The incentive problems they discuss are the technology transfer problem to developing countries and the ""lack of trust"" problem in the former Soviet Union.</p>"

The Power Of Kings: Monarchy And Religion In Europe 1589-1715,['Professor Paul Kleber Monod'],"Discussing monarchies throughout Europe, from Britain to Russia, Monod tells how sixteenth-century kings and queens were thought to heal the sick with a touch, were mediators between divine authority and the Christian self in quasi-religious ceremonies, and were seen as ideal mirrors of human identity. By 1715, the sacred authority of the monarchy had been supplanted by an ideology fusing internal moral responsibility with external obedience to an abstract political authority. Subjects were expected to identify not with a sacred king but with the natural person of the ruler. No longer divine, the kings and queens of the Enlightenment took up a new, more human place in the hearts and minds of their subjects."
Disease,"['Filer, Joyce.']","Disease and sickness were among the more unpleasant facts of life in ancient Egypt and Nubia, where many of the illnesses we encounter today, such as tuberculosis, leprosy and malaria were already flourishing. Drawing extensively on the evidence provided by human remains, texts, statuary and other works of art, Joyce Filer describes some of the health problems suffered by king and commoner alike. She examines the case of individuals such as Seneb, an achondroplastic dwarf who achieved high status as a court official during the Old Kingdom, or the young child whose crippling bone disease was revealed by the mummified remains. Dental disease, chest complaints and parasitic infection from the waters of the Nile were a common part of Egyptian daily life."
Love's Mind: An Essay On Contemplative Life,['John S. Dunne'],"Do we love with a love we know, or with a love we do not know? This question, posed to author John S. Dunne in a dream, and its answer prompts Dunne to describe in Love's Mind the journey one takes in contemplating and coming to know love, a journey that involves moving from the loneliness and restless longing of the human heart through spiritual friendship to the ultimate spiritual destination of love of God and union of love with God. The compass one uses on this personal journey is the way of contemplation. For Dunne the contemplative life is a dimension of every human life and should not be limited to the monastic way of life; instead, he considers it the missing dimension in our lives and times - times where violence has supplanted spiritual contemplation and left individuals deprived of the joy and challenge of the spiritual journey that ultimately leads to a union of love with God. As Dunne describes this journey, three features of the contemplative way of life emerge: the way of words, the way of music, and the way of spiritual friendship. He explores each with characteristic eloquence and introspection, drawing on his experiences of giving spiritual retreats, his presentations on violence and the contemplative life, and his insights on contemplation as the missing dimension in American life. In addition, Dunne considers the contemplations of Aquinas, Aristotle, and Augustine, and draws on a rich store of literary sources, in harmony with his view that art, literature, and music point to God. Ultimately, his insights lead him to a vision, like Augustine's, of the city of God - a city of the heart where contemplation takes the place of violence. Love's Mind is the story of how unknowing love becomes knowing love when one comes to the realization that our being in love may be God loving in us, and that our blind love may be God's unconditional love in us."
Death By Powerpoint,['Michael Flocker'],"Does your manager talk endlessly about ""engineering synergy"" and ""bridging disconnects?""

<p>""These brilliant and provocative essays step back from the trees-the millions of studies of sex and gender difference, non-differences, and meta-differences-and show us instead a way through the forest: the meanings and inventions of gender in modern life.

Memories Of Resistance: Women`s Voices From The Spanish Civil War,['Shirley Mangini'],"During the Spanish Civil War, women - long oppressed in Spain - were active both on the front and in the rear guard. This book is the first to focus on Spanish women's contributions to the war effort and the social and psychological implications of this radical change in their traditional role. Quoting extensively from such ""memory texts"" as oral testimonies, diaries, autobiographies, and letters, Shirley Mangini considers the status of women before, during, and after the war. She discusses the factors that provoked the war and how they affected Spanish women - both the ""visible"" women who during the turbulent 1920s and 1930s tried to become part of mainstream politics and the ""invisible"" women who came to the fore during the revolutionary years of the Second Spanish Republic from 1931 to 1936 and became activists in the protest against the military insurrection of 1936. She describes the incarceration and exile of women after the war and examines how they dealt with their lives during the long years of persecution and silence under the Franco regime from 1939 to 1975."
Sin And Censorship: The Catholic Church And The Motion Picture Industry,['Frank Walsh'],"During World War I, the Catholic church blocked the distribution of government-sponsored V.D. prevention films, initiating an era of attempts by the church to censor the movie industry.

<p>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, coupled with racism and wartime hysteria, generated widespread support for violating the civil rights of Japanese Americans living along the Pacific Coast of the United States.

Slinging Doughnuts For The Boys: An American Woman In World War Ii,"['Madison, James H.']","Elizabeth Richardson was a Red Cross volunteer who worked in a Clubmobile unit during World War II until her death in a plane crash in July 1945. Her job was to provide free doughnuts and coffee, cigarettes and gum to American soldiers on duty in England, and later in France. More importantly, she and her colleagues provided a slice of home. They were American girls with whom soldiers could talk, flirt, dance, and perhaps find companionship. For the most part, the job was not hazardous-except when V-1 rockets rained down on London-but it required physical endurance as well as the honed skills of a counselor. Liz Richardson was a witty writer and astute observer. Her letters and diaries reveal an intelligent, independent, and personable woman. In his commentary, James H. Madison provides fascinating insight into her life, the activities of the Red Cross Clubmobiles, and the war. This book is an exceptional window into a past that is all too quickly fading from memory."

The Reconfigured Eye: Visual Truth In The Post-photographic Era,['William J Mitchell'],"Enhanced? Or faked? Today the very idea of photographic veracity is being radically challenged by the emerging technology of digital image manipulation and synthesis: photographs can now be altered at will in ways that are virtually undetectable, and photorealistic synthesized images are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from actual photographs. Continuing William Mitchell's investigations of how we understand, reason about, and use images, The Reconfigured Eye provides the first systematic, critical analysis of the digital imaging revolution. It describes the technology of the digital image in detail and looks closely at how it is changing the way we explore ideas, at its aesthetic potential, and at the way we explore ideas, at its aesthetic potential, and at the ethical questions it raises.

Ernst Cassirer,['Seymour W. Itzkoff'],"Ernst Cassirer: Scientific Knowledge and the Concept of Man by Seymour W. Itzkoff is one of the few books currently available in the English language that discusses the philosophy of twentieth-century German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Itzkoff's study brings Cassirer's perspective directly into the contemporary debate over the evolution of human thought and its relationship to animal life. Further, Itzkoff places Cassirer directly in the context of recent philosophical thought, arguing for the importance of his Kantian perspective, a significance that is amply vindicated by the current interest in Cassirer's ideas. For this second edition, Itzkoff has written a new introduction and has added a new retrospective essay."

African Rain Forest Ecology And Conservation: An Interdisciplinary Perspective,"['Weber, William']","Extending from west Africa to Madagascar, from the vast lowland Congo Basin to the archipelago of forest islands on its eastern rim, the African rain forest is surpassed in size only by the Amazon. This book sheds light on the current efforts to understand and conserve the African rain forest, an area in need of urgent action to save its biological wealth, cultural heritage, and economic potential. 
<p>Written by conservation scientists and practitioners based in the African rain forest, the book offers a multidisciplinary perspective that integrates many biological and social sciences. Early chapters trace the forces-from paleoecological factors to recent human actions-that have shaped the African forest environment. The next chapters discuss the dominant biological patterns of species ranging from the distinctive elephants, gorillas, and okapi to the less well known birds, butterflies, and amphibians. Other chapters focus on how such different groups as hunter-gatherers, forest farmers, bushmeat hunters, recent immigrants, and commercial foresters have used the forests. Several authors stress the need for tighter links between research and conservation action. The final section draws lessons from the collective experience of those working in an Africa wracked by political strife and economic hardship.</p>"
The Short Stories Of F. Scott Fitzgerald: New Approaches In Criticism,['Jackson R. Bryer'],"F. Scott Fitzgerald produced 179 short stories in his prolific literary career. Although consistently popular with the reading public and widely anthologized, these works have suffered a strangely stony critical reception. Disparaged by some as mere potboilers and dismissed by others as a listless footnote to the novelist’s oeuvre, they remain the most seriously neglected aspect of Fitzgerald scholarship. It is in response to this absence of worthwhile commentary that editor Jackson R. Bryer sets forth here to redress what he calls a deplorable imbalance. Gathering together a variety of insightful essays on Fitzgerald’s short stories in a volume sure to excite students of American and contemporary literature, Bryer and his distinguished contributors begin to fill an unjustifiable critical void. The result is a unique collection, one that focuses attention on an unexplored body of work and becomes, in the process, eloquent witness to the depth, artistry, and resonant beauty of Fitzgerald’s short fiction."
Ferdinand Braun: A Life Of The Nobel Prizewinner And Inventor Of The Cathode-ray Oscilloscope,"['Friedrich Kurylo', 'Charles Susskind']","Ferdinand Braun was one of the great scientists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and one of the most productive. He discovered the rectifier effect, the basis of modern solid-state electronics—the seed from which grew today's semiconductors, transistors, silicon chips. He invented the cathode-ray oscilloscope, one of the most useful and versatile scientific instruments of the twentieth century—and the basis for our indispensible TV tubes. And he made pioneering and fundamental contributions to ""wireless telegraphy""—the work for which he and the universally remembered Marconi were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1909 and which led to today's radio, radar, and television transmissions. Add to this Braun's further accomplishments in pure science—his thermodynamic studies, his development of magnetic compounds—and it becomes clear that Braun has been unjustly neglected in the modern era whose technological foundation owes so much to his work.
<p>This scientific biography, however, does considerably more than restore Braun to his proper reputation: it has a fascinating story to tell. Of particular interest is its account of the early days of radio transmission, and the competition of Braun and his associates with Marconi and company to extend the range and improve the reception of radio signals. The technical basis of Braun's contributions are clearly explained.</p>
<p>The book follows Braun from his birth in 1850 through his university years in Marburg and Berlin, his teaching positions in Würzberg, Leipzig, Marburg, and Strasbourg, his most productive, creative years at Karlruhe, Tübingen, and again Strasbourg with their commercial ventures and succession of honors, to his death in 1918 in New York, where he was stranded as an enemy alien by World War I.</p>"
Hindu Festivals In A North Indian Village (anthropological Papers Of The American Museum Of Natural History),"['Stanley A. Freed', 'Ruth S. Freed']","Festivals are the most visible feature of village Hinduism. All common ritual practices are on display. The relationship of festivals to family life, the agricultural year, and to the everyday concerns of village people are clearly seen in offerings to deities, gifts exchanged between relatives, songs, drama, and storytelling. Festivals are the best point of entry into the study of Hinduism in ethnographic context. In Hindu Festivals in a North Indian Village the authors describe each festival, tracing its relationship to other important village institutions, such as caste, kinship, and seasonal agricultural activities. Their analysis goes beyond the festivals as practiced in Shanti Nagar to include comparisons with practices in other villages and references to Indian and Hindu history, mythology, astronomy, and astrology. They note differential participation in festivals by caste, sect, age, and gender. The study covers a period of two decades. Although the festivals continued almost unchanged during this time, the authors point out the few discernible differences."
"Official Truth, 101 Proof: The Inside Story Of Pantera",['Rex Brown'],"Few heavy metal acts survived the turmoil of the early 1990s music scene. Pantera was different. Instead of humoring the market, the band instead demanded that the audience come to them by releasing a series of fiercely uncompromising, platinum albums, including <i>Vulgar Display of Power</i> and <i>Far Beyond Driven</i>—two #1 albums that, like Metallica’s <i>And Justice for All</i>, sold millions of copies despite minimal airplay.
<p>Rex Brown’s memoir is the definitive account of life inside one of rock’s biggest bands, which succeeded against all odds but ultimately ended in tragedy when iconic lead guitarist Darrell “Dimebag” Abbott was murdered mid-performance by a deranged fan.</p>
<p>This is a lucid account of the previously untold story behind one of the most influential bands in heavy metal history, written by the man best qualified to tell the truth about those incredible and often difficult years of fame and excess.<br>

School Choice: The Struggle For The Soul Of American Education,['Mr. Peter W. Cookson  Jr.'],"Few school reform movements have aroused more public passion than school choice. Should families have a voice in deciding which schools their children attend? Is it true that increased competition leads to better schools? How do the various school choice proposals differ? Are school choice policies logistically feasible and economically viable? In this book, the educational sociologist Peter Cookson discusses the practice and politics of school choice objectively and comprehensively. Cookson illuminates the philosophical and historical origins of the school choice movement, examines a variety of school choice plans around the nation, and analyzes the outcomes of school choice in terms of student achievement, school improvement, and the rights of the citizenry. Drawing on his own observations, interviews, and analyses of school choice research, Cookson clarifies a number of issues surrounding this hotly debated topic. He discusses, for example: programs in Minnesota, Cambridge and Fall River, Massachusetts, and East Harlem and White Plains, New York, that demonstrate how choice can solve fundamental educational problems; a voucher system in Milwaukee that allows children to enroll in private as well as public schools; whether establishing an educational marketplace might result in fraudulent representation and other business malpractices; whether choice policies will overcome or intensify social stratification and segregation. Cookson argues that school choice can be a useful tactic of educational reform, but that without good schools to choose among and full access to information about the options, the ability to choose is meaningless. He concludes by offering a proposal that would make school choice an innovative mechanism in the creation of a school system that is at once more egalitarian and superior."
When Baby Boom Women Retire:,['Nancy Dailey'],"Fewer than 20% of Baby Boom women will experience a secure retirement. Marriage, education, occupation, home ownership--these variables predict their future. Possession of all four indicates retirement security, and absence of any increases risk of old-age poverty. These and other findings about Baby Boom women's retirement are outlined in this book."
Figure Skating: A History,"['Hines, James R. (james Robert) , 1937-']","Figure skating, unique in its sublimely beautiful combination of technical precision, musicality, and interpretive elements, has undergone many dramatic developments since the only previous history of the sport was published in 1959. This exciting and information-packed new history by James R. Hines explains skating's many technical and artistic advances, its important figures, its intrigues and scandals, and the historical high points during its long evolution. Hines divides his history into three periods separated by the World Wars. In the first section, he follows functional and recreational ice skating through its evolution into national schools, culminating in the establishment of the International Skating Union and the ascendancy of an international style of skating. The second section explains the changes that occurred as the sport expanded into the form we recognize and enjoy today, and the final section shows how skating became increasingly athletic, imaginative, and intense following World War II, as the main focus turns to skaters themselves. The profiles include some 148 World and Olympic Champions as well as others who, in Dick Button's words, ""left the sport better because they were in it."" Beginning with mythological tales from twelfth- and thirteenth-century Scandinavians, Hines describes hundreds who have contributed to the sport. They include figure skating's patron saint Lydwina of Schiedam, whose late-fourteenth-century skating tumble has been documented in a woodcut; Ulrich Salchow and Axel Paulsen, who gave their names to distinctive jumps; Madge Syers, who entered and medaled at the previously all-male World Championships in 1902; and Sonja Henie, who took skating to the silver screen. The history ends with the 2002 skating season, when Maria Butyrskaya and Michelle Kwan commanded the most attention and an unfortunate judging decision rocked the pairs' competition, resulting in the adoption of a new judging system.Beyond the contributions of individual skaters, <i>Figure Skating</i> also traces the growth of competitions and show skating (professional and amateur), and discussions of relevant social, political, and ethical concerns that have affected the sport. Along with over seventy magnificent historical pictures spread throughout the book, a very special gallery features the picture of every world and Olympic champion. <i>Figure Skating</i> is an informative and inspiring resource, sure to be enjoyed by anyone who has ever skated recreationally or in competition as well as by the many fans who have this beautiful sport as spectators."

History And Society In Central America (translations From Latin America Series),['Edelberto Torres Rivas'],"First published in Chile in 1969 as Interpretación del desarrollo social centroamericano, this classic is now available in English. The first attempt at an integrated analysis of modern Central America's socioeconomic structure, Torres Rivas's work traces the social development of Central America from independence (1871) up to the 1960s.<br>
 Using a dependency framework, but not limited by it, Torres Rivas describes the various divisions of Central American society and their evolution within the liberal development model that has been so much a part of the past century of Central American economic history. The book is compelling in its explanation of the relationship between foreign and native elements in the social development of the region. Torres Rivas describes and analyzes the resulting long-term problems this development has posed for Central America. With a new chapter added for the English edition, History and Society in Central America remains vital for readers interested in the region."

A Life Of James Boswell,"['Martin, Peter , 1940-']","For almost one hundred and fifty years after his death in 1795, James Boswell was considered to be a foolish failure, and his masterful biography, The Life of Samuel Johnson, was regarded as an accidental work of genius by a man who was primarily a drinker, gambler, and womanizer. When Boswell's personal journals were discovered in the 1920s and 1930s, however, it became necessary to reassess him. With the publication of the journals, Boswell has emerged not only as a writer of the highest order but also as a man of geniality and high spirits who was unjustly mocked and chastened.
<p>In this moving biography, Peter Martin assesses Boswell's literary achievements and uncovers the dynamic world in which he lived, from royal courts and drawing rooms to London's unsavory underworld. He reveals a man plagued by hypochondria and melancholia, equally candid about his pursuit of pleasure and the guilt that often followed—a complex, infuriating, yet ultimately appealing character who produced much more than one superbly crafted work of literature.<br>

The Electronic Design Studio: Architectural Education In The Computer Era,['M Mccullough'],"For centuries architects have carried out shape computations by hand, using informal procedures and the simplest of tools. Over the last two decades, however, they have made increasing use of more formal procedures executed by computers, a development that raises challenging questions of architectural theory and perplexing issues for those concerned with the future of architectural education. In four parts - theoretical foundations, electronic media in the design studio, information delivery systems for design, and knowledge based design systems - this book frames those issues and provides a diversity of perspectives on them.
<p><i>The Electronic Design Studio</i> contains over thirty extensively illustrated contributions that discuss the experiences of universities in the United States, Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada, and Australia with computer-aided architectural (CAAD) design, articulate current theoretical and practical concerns, provide criticism of media and methods, and suggest directions for the future. Architectural educators and architects concerned with the effect of computer technology on the design process will find this book an indispensable reference. As a current review of the state of the art of CAAD and an overview of the major issues, this is the most comprehensive source available.</p>"

The Disobedient Writer: Women And Narrative Tradition,"['Walker, Nancy A. , 1942-']","For centuries, women who aspired to write had to enter a largely male literary tradition that offered few, if any, literary forms in which to express their perspectives on lived experience. Since the nineteenth century, however, women writers and readers have been producing ""disobedient"" counter-narratives that, while clearly making reference to the original texts, overturn their basic assumptions.<br>
 This book looks at both canonical and non-canonical works, over a variety of fiction and nonfiction genres, that offer counter-readings of familiar Western narratives. Nancy Walker begins by probing women's revisions of two narrative traditions pervasive in Western culture: the biblical story of Adam and Eve, and the traditional fairy tales that have served as paradigms of women's behavior and expectations. She goes on to examine the works of a wide range of writers, from contemporaries Marilynne Robinson, Ursula Le Guin, Anne Sexton, Fay Weldon, Angela Carter, and Margaret Atwood to precursors Caroline Kirkland, Fanny Fern, Mary De Morgan, Mary Louisa Molesworth, Edith Nesbit, and Evelyn Sharp.<br>"
"The Contingency Of Theory: Pragmatism, Expressivism, And Deconstruction",['Mr. Gary Wihl'],"For contemporary pragmatists, the study of literature supports the development of liberal, pluralist societies. As the product of multiple interpretive communities, works of literature promote cultural diversity, strengthen the expresssion of human agents' beliefs and values, and emphasize the ordinary rather than the theoretical context of interpretive practices. But what exactly is the relationship between pragmatism and theories of textuality in the literary disciplines? Pragmatists embrace the concept of textuality but do not concede that textuality changes anything about how we interpret literature in specific social contexts. Gary Wihl argues for the first time that theories of textuality contain an important expressivist philosophy of language that has been overlooked by pragmatists. According to Wihl, expressivism enriches the pragmatist concept of interpretive communities by focusing on forms of language that shape personhood and cultural value. Highly textual theories like deconstruction can refine and enhance the expressivist element in works of literature. Wihl offers the first direct comparison and synthesis of writings by Stanley Cavell, Paul de Man, Stanley Fish, and Charles Taylor. Brought together in this book, pragmatism, expressivism, and deconstruction restore the philosophical importance of literature by according it a formative role in the definition of human selves."
Wallace Nutting And The Invention Of Old America (wadsworth Atheneum Museum Of Art),['Thomas Andrew Denenberg'],"For devotees of American decorative arts, Wallace Nutting (1861-1941) needs little introduction. A Congregational minister turned author, photographer, and wildly successful entrepreneur, Nutting was the principal authority on early American furniture for much of the twentieth century and played an important role in the development of a colonial revival aesthetic and ideology. He collected, reproduced, and marketed colonial artifacts, and the goods and experiences he offered his middle-class customers promoted his idealized notion of a time and place that he called ""Old America."" This handsomely illustrated book is the first full-length study of Nutting's life and work. Thomas Andrew Denenberg describes Nutting's interrelated endeavors, from his varied writings (including Furniture of the Pilgrim Century and the monumental three-volume Furniture Treasury) to his photography (both amateur and professional), chain of restored museum houses, renowned collection of seventeenth-century furniture, reproduction colonial furniture business, and advertising program. By charting Nutting's activities, Denenberg creates a picture of an influential cultural critic who deftly combined myth and materialism, contributing significantly to both the growth of consumerism and the development of an antimodern world-view in the twentieth-century United States. Thomas Andrew Denenberg is the Richard Koopman Curator of American Decorative Arts at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford, Connecticut."
"The Last Days Of The Jerusalem Of Lithuania: Chronicles From The Vilna Ghetto And The Camps, 1939-1944",['Herman Kruk'],"For five horrifying years in Vilna, the Vilna ghetto, and concentration camps in Estonia, Herman Kruk recorded his own experiences as well as the life and death of the Jewish community of the city symbolically called ""The Jerusalem of Lithuania."" This unique chronicle includes many recovered pages of Kruk's diaries and provides a powerful eyewitness account of the annihilation of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. This volume includes the Yiddish edition of Kruk's diaries, published in 1961 and translated here for the first time, as well as many widely scattered pages of the chronicles, collected here for the first time and meticulously deciphered, translated, and annotated.
<p>Kruk describes vividly the collapse of Poland in September, 1939, life as a refugee in Vilna, the manhunt that destroyed most of Vilna Jewry in the summer of 1941, the creation of a ghetto and the persecution and self-rule of the remnants of the ""Jerusalem of Lithuania,"" the internment of the last survivors in concentration camps in Estonia, and their brutal deaths. Kruk scribbled his final diary entry on September 17, 1944, managing to bury the small, loose pages of his manuscript just hours before he and other camp inmates were shot to death and their bodies burnt on a pyre.</p>
<p>Kruk's writings illuminate the tragedy of the Vilna Jews and their courageous efforts to maintain an ideological, social, and cultural life even as their world was being destroyed. To read Kruk's day-by-day account of the unfolding of the Holocaust is to discern the possibilities for human courage and perseverance even in the face of profound fear.</p>"

Science As Writing,['David Locke'],"For many years it has been assumed that a great gulf exists between science and the humanities, that the writings of science are simply the record of things scientists do and find and are devoid of literary features. Recently this assumption has been challenged by those who regard science and literature as companion endeavors, working side by side to describe, in their respective ways, the world of human experience. Now David Locke, a professor of literature who has also been a scientist, joins the debate, arguing that scientific language can be highly imaginative, expressive, and self-conscious and demonstrating for the first time how the major modes of literary criticism can be keys to the reading of scientific texts. Locke takes up in sequence six critical perspectives on reading. These view literary texts as: essentially representation of the real world; an expression of its author's thoughts and feelings; an activator of response from its readers; a work of art, interesting in its purely formal properties; an artifact situated in a social milieu; or an instrument that brings the world of phenomena into being. Locke applies these perspectives to the reading of a variety of scientific texts, from works by Galileo and Darwin to writings in contemporary molecular biology and theoretical physics. Locke suggests that attention to the literary qualities of scientific discourse will aid in further opening up the literary canon and widening the practice of literary criticism, even as it sharpens science's growing interest in, and understanding of, its own mode of operation."
Friends Along The Way: A Journey Through Jazz,['Gene Lees'],"For more than half a century, jazz writer and lyricist Gene Lees has been the friend of many in the world of jazz music. In this delightful book he offers minibiographies of fifteen of these friends-some of them jazz greats, some lesser-known figures, and some up-and-comers.

Jump At The Sun: Zora Neale Hurston's Cosmic Comedy,"['Lowe, John , 1945-']","For the writer/anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston, humor offered ""a way out of no way,"" helping African American culture survive the harsh realities of life. The humor in Hurston's writing was a vehicle for subversive observations on intolerable conditions, yet it also provided a joyous commentary on the paradoxically creative and exuberant folk culture of an oppressed people. John Lowe explores the comic elements of Hurston's fiction in the first book-length critical study to draw on her entire body of work. Tracing connections between Hurston's life and the cultural, historical, and literary events that affected her, Lowe reveals the sources of her humor and its serious purposes by using social science humor theory, American studies, feminist theory, Bakhtin, and close readings of Hurston's fiction, nonfiction, manuscripts, and letters. Lowe also shows how Hurston balanced her levity with a resonant cosmic language drawn largely from African and African American religious imagery."
Cary Grant: A Class Apart,['Graham Mccann'],"For two movie-going generations, Cary Grant was class--an effortless embodiment of gentlemanly grace and humor. But Cary Grant's greatest achievement was in creating himself, and the irresistible character he became. In this savvy, fascinating portrait, Graham McCann tracks the transformation of a life and looks closely at the sources of Cary Grant's charms. They did not come easily: born Archie Leach to a poor working-class family in Bristol, England, Grant reveled in ambiguities and surprises. Trained early in the arts of vaudeville, he was a supremely physical leading man; in memorable films, he was the American hero with the ripe British accent or the intimate stranger who was often the seduced male; in life, he was a celebrated entertainer who also became a wealthy businessman.
<p> Graham McCann writes insightfully about Grant's work and life, including his turbulent relationships with women, his LSD therapy, and his rumored homosexuality. Generously filled with anecdotes about fellow actors and directors, a realistic portrait of a complicated man emerges. Alfred Hitchcock enjoyed casting Grant as the ""normal"" man to whom abnormal things happen in North by Northwest. Howard Hawks encouraged Grant to use his vaudeville experience to coach Katharine Hepburn on pratfalls and comic timing in Bringing Up Baby. And although Grant was criticized for remaining in Hollywood during World War II, it now seems, according to McCann, that he worked as a special agent for British Intelligence, reporting pro-Nazi activities in Hollywood. In 1947 Grant received the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom, an award that was not made public at the time. This biography yields a new appreciation of Cary Grant's work and his persona, one that was at once familiar, yet always enigmatic, even to those who knew him best. Equally compelling to general readers, scholars, and students of American film history, this book includes photos, detailed chapter notes, and a filmography.</p>"
Agenda For Reform: The Future Of Employment Relationships And The Law,['William B. Gould Iv'],"For years William Gould has argued for labor law reform that would facilitate trade union organization and collective bargaining. That position, which he expands upon in this latest book, is based on his belief in the value of pluralism, the importance of employee participation in the economy as well as the political process, and the effectiveness of unions in best advocating employee interests in the workplace. In the face of increased erosion in worker protection and weakening of the collective bargaining process, Gould proposes an agenda of reforms to balance the interests of management and workers, and to protect employee participation and job security.
<p>Each chapter presents in-depth summaries of developed areas of labor or employment law and related policies. At the core of Gould's discussion are the workings and usefulness of the National Labor Relations Act. Gould first provides a history of the past and current labor management relationships - how we got where we are today - and then reviews and evaluates such factors as the possible repeal or reform of the NLRA, the possible increase in worker participation plans, the change in the use of the strike weapon, wrongful discharge law, the protections afforded nonunion employees, and race relations as factors that will affect the future of the labor management relationship and, consequently, the future of industrial relations.</p>"
Forbidden Relatives: The American Myth Of Cousin Marriage,['Martin Ottenheimer'],"Forbidden Relatives challenges the belief - widely held in the United States - that legislation against marriage between first cousins is based on a biological risk to offspring. In fact, its author maintains, the U.S. prohibition against such unions originated largely because of the belief that it would promote more rapid assimilation of immigrants. A social anthropologist, Martin Ottenheimer questioned U.S. laws against cousin marriage because his research into marriage patterns around the world showed no European countries prohibit such unions. He examines the historical development of U.S. laws governing marriage, contrasts them with European laws, and analyzes the genetic implications of first cousin marriage. Modern genetic evidence, Ottenheimer says, doesn't support the concept that children of these unions are at any special risk."

Frames,"['Penny, Nicholas , 1949-']","Frames often catch the eye and arouse the curiosity of visitors to galleries and museums, yet labels and catalogues rarely comment on them and handy introductions are hard to come by. In this survey, Nicholas Penny conveys his passionate interest in the history of frames, the design and techniques of frame-making, what frames do for paintings and the part they play in the decoration and often the architecture of an interior. The emphasis is on their changing function and varied purpose as well as the different styles of ornament, materials, finishes and techniques employed. Severe ebony mouldings are included as well as elaborate gilded carvings, second-hand frames as well as original ones, frames to rest on altars but also frames to catch the eye in a dealer's window. The Pocket Guide is illustrated by frames from the National Gallery's magnificent collection, which has some of the finest examples of the frame-maker's craft, reflecting the taste of individual artists and collectors over the centuries."

"Seeing Red: Federal Campaigns Against Black Militancy, 1919-1925 (blacks In The Diaspo)",['Theodore Kornweibel'],"From 1918 into the early 1920s, any African Americans who spoke out forcefully for their race—editors, union organizers, civil rights advocates, radical political activists, and Pan-Africanists—were likely to be investigated by a network of federal intelligence agencies, most ruthlessly by the Bureau of Investigation (renamed the FBI in 1935). The ""crime"" which justified such surveillance was almost always the ideas these individuals expressed. Agents of the federal government watched them, tapped their phones, rifled their offices, opened their mail, infiltrated their organizations, intimidated their audiences, and caused them to suffer the prospect of prosecution, all because of their beliefs. 
<p><i>""Seeing Red"": Federal Campaigns against Black Militancy, 1919-1925</i>, by Theodore Kornweibel, Jr., is the gripping, painstakingly documented account of this neglected chapter in the history of American political intelligence.</p>
<p>Kornweibel has pieced together how the federal government's political intelligence system took shape during and after World War I. Despite the fact that the Bureau was ordered to cease political spying in 1924, it never did. Nor did the army or State Department halt their intelligence activities during the interwar years. World War II added a new urgency and additional targets to the domestic intelligence system, which then moved unchecked into the Cold War era.</p>
<p>Kornweibel documents the crucial and early role played by the young J. Edgar Hoover, then an ambitious Justice Department attorney. ""In spearheading the Bureau of Investigation's anti-radical crusade in 1919, [Hoover] fixated on the belief that racial militants were seeking to break down social barriers separating blacks from whites, and that they were inspired by communists or were the pawns of communists. These notions became imbedded in the FBI and its director. Hoover's hostility toward Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil rights movement of the 1960s was shaped by the fears which Hoover conjured up in 1919 and which he helped cement into the Bureau's institutional memory.""</p>
<p>Kornweibel's research discloses the Bureau's extensive use of black undercover informants and infiltrators, a practice necessitated by the inability of white agents to penetrate racial organizations and gain the confidence of black militants. His accounts of the Bureau's first black agents describe their accomplishments and failures but resist moral judgment on their activities. He points out that Marcus Garvey, the pan-Africanist who was a major target of the government's campaign, is widely honored today, but in the 1920s his sizable following was counterbalanced by many who sincerely believed he was dangerously misleading the race. Identifying for the first time informants and agents provocateurs, as well as conveying the dilemma of the first black federal investigators, Kornweibel has discovered a number of interesting figures.</p>
<p>Readers will learn for the first time about James E. Amos, the second African American agent hired by the Bureau of Investigation, but the first to operate publicly. He would serve the Bureau for over 30 years, earning the high regard of Hoover—who was otherwise hostile to hiring black agents. Before joining the Bureau, Amos had served with the Interior Department and Customs Office, and for 12 years worked as President Theodore Roosevelt's personal attendant, confidential messenger, and bodyguard. Amos was put in charge of the Marcus Garvey case, identifying and ""encouraging"" witnesses to testify against him. Says Kornweibel: ""As a pathfinder, Amos has no peer: he, more than any of the other early black agents, 'proved' what should never have needed proving: that African Americans could serve the federal government in sensitive positions with objectivity, intelligence, and professionalism.""</p>
<p>Strongly written and exhaustively researched, ""Seeing Red"" sheds new light on the federal injustice that prevailed after World War I, establishing a pattern of hostility to racial and civil rights progress that persisted for the next 50 years, until after the death of J. Edgar Hoover.</p>"

State Fair,"['Grace, Arthur.']","From prize-winning pigs to corn dog-eating contests, from beauty queens to marching bands, from gravity-defying midway rides to miracle machines for back pain, from butter sculptures to demolition derbies, state fairs are a mother lode of pure Americana.<br>
 State Fair is a visual distillation of Arthur Grace's photographic odyssey through fairs in ten states--California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. Time and again, regardless of geographical location, Grace's images deftly capture the strange mixture of the traditional, the kitsch, and the off-the-wall that is unique to these annual gatherings, which began as a celebration of rural American life and have evolved into super-sized extravaganzas. Whether the photographs show the beaming pride of 4-H egg champions, the intensity of a tattooed arm wrestler, or a forlorn alligator waiting to be ""wrestled"" in a wading pool, the authenticity of Grace's imagery is unmistakable. You can almost hear the shouts from the midway, smell the animals in the barns, and taste the cherry pie.<br>
 Sure to bring back vivid memories for anyone who's ever attended a state fair, and bound to entice the uninitiated, State Fair reminds us how much we still crave to go out and have real experiences beyond the fantasies we see on our computer, TV, and movie screens. It shows that far from being an anachronism in the twenty-first century, state fairs are a vital, living tradition throughout America.<br>"
The French In Love And War: Popular Culture In The Era Of The World Wars,['Charles Rearick'],"From the bloodbaths of the First World War through the military defeat and Nazi occupation of the Second World War, the people of France struggled with the pain and anxieties of a nation in crisis. In this sophisticated cultural history of France from 1914 to 1945, Charles Rearick tells how the French discovered ways to cope and found reassurance and relief through songs, movies, and images of ordinary people that they took to heart. Augmenting this fascinating story with more than 125 illustrations, Rearick reveals the power of popular myths and symbols at work throughout a critical period of the twentieth century. In everyday life of this time, stories of ordinary French people carried important messages of gritty self-reliance and cheerful good humor. Images of common folk - the jovial infantryman and his devoted woman, the bantering working-class Parisian, the suntanned hiking youth, the militant striker - drew on shared experiences, wishes, fears, and interests. These were embodied in the songs and personas of such musical stars as Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Tino Rossi, Charles Trenet, and Edith Piaf; in the films of such directors as Rene Clair, Jean Renoir, Julien Duvivier, and Marcel Pagnol; and in movie characters played by Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Michele Morgan, and others. Rearick shows how these celebrities and characters influenced the ways in which the French redefined their lives and responded to adversity."
The Gardener's Year,['Karel Capek'],"From the internationally acclaimed Czech writer Karel Capek comes this beautifully written and marvelously apt account of the trials and tribulations of the gardener's life. First published in Prague in 1929, The Gardener's Year combines a richly comic portrait of life in the garden, narrated month by month, with a series of delightful illustrations by the author's older brother and collaborator, Josef. Capek's gardeners -- all too human, despite their lofty aspirations -- often look the fool, whether they be found sopping wet, victims of the cobralike water hose, or hunched over, hands immersed in the soil, ``presenting their rumps to the splendid azure sky.'' In their repeated folly, Capek gives us not only cause for laughter but also, in the end, ``testimony of the imperishable and miraculous optimism of the human race.''

Life On The Russian Country Estate: A Social And Cultural History,"['Roosevelt, P. R. (priscilla R.)']","From the reign of Peter the Great, Russia's country estates were oases of barbarian splendor and personal freedom in a vast, sparsely settled, and authoritarian land. This lavishly illustrated book is the first in any language to explore fully the vanished world of the Russian country estate. Priscilla Roosevelt brings to life these magnificent aristocratic dwellings, discussing their origins, their design and decoration, the social, family, and cultural life within their walls, and their physical demise after the 1917 revolution. The Bolshevik revolution destroyed both the world of the estate and much of the evidence about it. To recreate this lost world Roosevelt has drawn on many sources - including the physical remains of once-grand manor houses (many photographed for this book), the invaluable diaries and memoirs that chronicle a way of life that was to perish, and the Russian art and literature that estate life produced and in which it was portrayed. Juxtaposing images from art and from the novels of such literary giants as Turgenev and Tolstoy with the real milieu that inspired them, the book is a beautiful and vivid portrait of Russian country life.

Selected letters of Rebecca West,"['West, Rebecca , 1892-1983']","From the time that George Bernard Shaw remarked that ""Rebecca West could handle a pen as brilliantly as ever I could and much more savagely,"" West's writings and her politics have elicited strong reactions. This collection of her letters—the first ever published—has been culled from the estimated ten thousand she wrote during her long life. The more than two hundred selected letters follow this spirited author, critic, and journalist from her first feminist campaign for woman suffrage when she was a teenager through her reassessments of the twentieth century written in 1982, in her ninetieth year.
<p>The letters, which are presented in full, include correspondence with West's famous lover H. G. Wells and with Shaw, Virginia Woolf, Emma Goldman, Noël Coward, any many others; offer pronouncements on such contemporary authors as Norman Mailer, Nadine Gordimer, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.; and provide new insights into her battles against misogyny, fascism, and communism. West deliberately fashions her own biography through this intensely personal correspondence challenging rival accounts of her groundbreaking professional career, her frustratinglove life, and her tormented family relations. Engrossing to read, the collection sheds new light on this important figure and her social and literary milieu.</p>

Places For Dead Bodies,['Gary J. Hausladen'],"From Tony Hillerman's Navajo Southwest to Martin Cruz Smith's Moscow, an exotic, vividly described locale is one of the great pleasures of many murder mysteries. In fact, the sense of place, no less than the compelling character of the detective, is often what keeps authors writing and readers reading a particular series of mystery novels.<br>
 This book investigates how ""police procedural"" murder mysteries have been used to convey a sense of place. Gary Hausladen delves into the work of more than thirty authors, including Tony Hillerman, Martin Cruz Smith, James Lee Burke, David Lindsey, P. D. James, and many others. Arranging the authors by their region of choice, he discusses police procedurals set in America, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Europe, Russia, Asia, and selected locales in other parts of the world, as well as in historical places ranging from the Roman Empire to turn-of-the-century Cairo.<br>"
Mussolini's Shadow: The Double Life Of Count Galeazzo Ciano,['Ray Moseley'],"Galeazzo Ciano was a brilliant, ambitious and ruthless young Italian.Throughout his period in office Ciano kept a diary so detailed and revealing that both Mussolini and Hitler sought to impound and destroy it. The diary was smuggled out of Italy by Edda, who sought, unsuccessfully, to trade it for Ciano's life. The diary was later acquired by the American spy, Allen W. Dulles (later head of the CIA) and extracted in the Chicago Daily News. It remains one of the classic insider accounts of the workings of the Fascist governments. Ciano's glamorous, violent, and promiscuous life was acted out at the highest levels of European politics and society. There has never been a biography of him in English: this one is a gripping read."

A Voice Of Thunder: A Black Soldier's Civil War (blacks In The New World),['Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz'],"George E. Stephens, the most important African-American war correspondent of his era, served in the famed black Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment, subject of the film Glory. His letters from the front, published in the New York Weekly Anglo-African, brilliantly detail two wars: one against the Confederacy and one against the brutal, debilitating racism within his own Union Army."
Errata : An Examined Life,['George Steiner'],"George Steiner, one of the great literary minds of our century, now relates the story of his own life and the ways that people, places, and events have colored the central ideas and themes of his work. His most personal book, this volume reveals Steiner's thoughts on the meaning of the western tradition and its philosophic and religious premises, his pleasure in literature and music, and his regrets about the unopened doors and untapped resources in his past. Born in Paris in 1929 of Viennese Jewish parents, Steiner was raised speaking German, French, and English. He was educated and an educator himself in the United States and in Europe, crossing continents and cultures over the course of this troubled century. Steiner interweaves episodes from his past with thoughts about the present: he recalls, for example, how his father introduced him to the Iliad in Greek shortly before his sixth birthday, and muses about the genius of Homer; he describes the effect of the Holocaust on his family, and explores why Jews have been persecuted and have survived over the millennium; and he takes stock of science, reason, atheism, and religion in his own life and at the end of this century."
Castles Made Of Sound: The Story Of Gil Evans,['Larry Hicock'],"Gil Evans was once described by Miles Davis as ""the greatest musician in the world,"" yet he has remained one of the least known and most underrated innovators in jazz. Revered by generations of musicians, Evans created a unique sound, drawing from such diverse inspirations as Duke Ellington, Claude Debussy, Charlie Parker, Cecil Taylor, and Jimi Hendrix. Best known for his collaboration with Miles Davis on albums such as <i>Birth of the Cool</i> and <i>Sketches of Spain</i>, Gil Evans secured a crucial place in the history of modern jazz with his stunning orchestral arrangements. Now Evans's life and work are critically explored in this intimate, comprehensive biography of the arranger, composer, orchestrator, and bandleader. Hicock traces Evans’s early work with swing, bebop, and cool jazz (which he helped to create); examines his pathbreaking work with Miles Davis; sheds new light on his innovations of the 1960s and '70s; and recounts his great final flourish of activities in the 1980s. Drawing from more than seventy exclusive interviews and featuring the voices of many of Evans's fellow musicians, this portrait of a quiet innovator and a beloved free spirit will restore him to his rightful place in jazz history."
Mazzini,['Denis Mack Smith'],"Giuseppe Mazzini was one of the outstanding figures in the political history of nineteenth-century Europe. A vigorous proponent of nationalism, pre-eminent figure in the struggle for Italian independence and unity, and fascinating personality, his ideas were influential throughout Europe. Yet successive Italian governments, fearing the consequences of his belief in democracy and revolution, deliberately obscured his achievements: there have been few modern studies of Mazzini, and no biography in English since 1902. Denis Mack Smith's major new account re-examines Mazzini's ideological impact and his place in the political and intellectual world of the mid-nineteenth century. Based on profound scholarship and immense archival research, the book vividly re-creates Mazzini's long years of poverty and exile in London, and the networks of friends, associates and enemies that brought him into contact with the greatest European figures of the age, among them Marx, Carlyle, Mill, and Bakunin. Mazzini is revealed as an acute but largely unrecognised prophet of the idea of a European community: he saw nationalism as a step towards larger and more harmonious confederations. Adept at inspiring animosity, as well as admiration, Mazzini affronted the pope by his demand for religious reform, Karl Marx by his powerful critique of communism, and many of his less enlightened contemporaries by his campaigns on behalf of social security, universal suffrage, and women's rights. Yet he was universally venerated for his brilliance, humanity and wisdom, and even his critics agreed that he left an enduring mark on his time."

Raise up off me: a portrait of Hampton Hawes,"['Hawes, Hampton , 1928-1977']","Hampton Hawes [1928–1977] was one of jazz’s greatest pianists. Among his peers from California the self-taught Hawes was second only to Oscar Peterson. At the time of his celebration as New Star of the Year by downbeat magazine (1956), Hawes was already struggling with a heroin addiction that would lead to his arrest and imprisonment, and the interruption of a brilliant career. In 1963 President John F. Kennedy granted Hawes an Executive Pardon. In eloquent and humorous language Hampton Hawes tells of a life of suffering and redemption that reads like an improbable novel. Gary Giddins has called it “a major contribution to the literature of jazz.” This book includes a complete discography and eight pages of photographs."
Texian Iliad: A Military History Of The Texas Revolution,['Stephen L. Hardin'],"Hardly were the last shots fired at the Alamo before the Texas Revolution entered the realm of myth and controversy. French visitor Frederic Gaillardet called it a ""Texian Iliad"" in 1839, while American Theodore Sedgwick pronounced the war and its resulting legends ""almost burlesque.""<br>
 In this highly readable history, Stephen L. Hardin discovers more than a little truth in both of those views. Drawing on many original Texan and Mexican sources and on-site inspections of almost every battlefield, he offers the first complete military history of the Revolution. From the war's opening in the ""Come and Take It"" incident at Gonzales to the capture of General Santa Anna at San Jacinto, Hardin clearly describes the strategy and tactics of each side. His research yields new knowledge of the actions of famous Texan and Mexican leaders, as well as fascinating descriptions of battle and camp life from the ordinary soldier's point of view.<br>
 This in-depth coverage provides a balanced view of the Revolution that fairly assesses the conduct of both Texans and Mexicans. Texian Iliad belongs on the bookshelf of everyone interested in Texas or military history.<br>"

A decade into his relationship with Stu, an airline pilot from a fraught Jewish family, he fears heâs losing Stu to other men-and losing himself in their 'no rules' arrangement. Yearning for a baby and a deeper commitment, he pressures Stu to move from Manhattan to Cape Cod, to the cottage where Pat spent boyhood summers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As they struggle to adjust to their new life, they enlist a surrogate: Debora, a charismatic Brazilian immigrant, married to Danny, an American carpenter. Gradually, Pat and Debora bond, drawn together by the logistics of getting pregnant and away from their spouses. Pat gets caught between loyalties-to Stu and his family, to Debora, to his own potent desires-and wonders: is he fit to be a father?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In one of the first novels to explore the experience of gay men seeking a child through surrogacy, Michael Lowenthal writes passionately about marriages and mistakes, loyalty and betrayal, and about how our drive to create families can complicate the ones we already have. <i>The Paternity Test</i> is a provocative look at the new 'family values.'"
In the shadow of the swastika,['Mark Wygoda; foreword by Michael Berenbaum'],"He was known first as a Warsaw ghetto smuggler, then as Comandante Enrico. He traveled under false identity papers and worked at a German border patrol station. Throughout the years of the Holocaust, Hermann Wygoda lived a life of narrow escapes, unsavory masquerades, and battles that almost defy reason. In the Shadow of the Swastika tells the story of a Polish Jew whose harrowing wartime adventures reached their amazing end when he received the American Bronze Star from Gen. Mark Clark in June 1946. Wygoda kept a journal during the time he spent in the mountains of northern Italy, where he rose from commanding a platoon to leading a division of nearly twenty-five hundred partisans that ultimately liberated the city of Savona."

From Spirituals To Symphonies: African-american Women Composers And Their Music,"['Walker-hill, Helen.']","Helen Walker-Hill's unique study provides a carefully researched examination of the history and scope of musical composition by African-American women composers from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Exploding the assumption that black women's only important musical contributions have been in folk, jazz, and pop, From Spirituals to Symphonies focuses on the effect of race, gender, and class, and notes the important role played by individual personalities and circumstances in shaping this under-appreciated category of American art. The study also provides in-depth exploration of the backgrounds, experiences, and musical compositions of eight African-American women including Margaret Bonds, Undine Smith Moore, and Julia Perry, who combined the techniques of Western art music with their own cultural traditions and individual gifts. Despite having gained national and international recognition during their lifetimes, the contributions of many of these women are today forgotten.<br>

Herbert Butterfield: historian as dissenter,"['Mcintire, C. T.']","Herbert Butterfield (1900-1979) was an important British historian and religious thinker whose ideas, in particular his concept of a ""Whig interpretation of history,"" remain deeply influential. In this intellectual biography -- the first comprehensive study of Butterfield -- C. T. McIntire focuses on the creative processes that lay behind Butterfield's accomplishments. McIntire describes the career trajectory of a man whose intellectual achievements propelled him from a worker's cottage in an industrial village in West Yorkshire to the Regius Professorship of Modern History at Cambridge University and to a knighthood from the Queen. He discusses Butterfield's lifelong devotion to his Methodist faith and shows how his Christian spirituality animated his historical work. Drawing on his investigation into Butterfield's vast and diverse output of written work -- including his voluminous unpublished lectures, notes, letters, and diaries -- as well as on extensive interviews with him and those close to him, McIntire explores Butterfield's ideas and methods. He traces the theme of dissent that ran through Butterfield's life and work, presenting a man who found himself at odds with prevailing convictions about history, morality, politics, science, religion, and teaching. Butterfield's writing style was adversative, his thinking iconoclastic, and his teetotaler's option for ginger beer over fine wines countercultural. He elevated the notion of dissent into an ethic of living in tension with any established system. This thought-provoking book offers an unprecedented look at a man many regarded as the most original historian of his generation."
Three-legged horse,"['Zheng, Qingwen , 1932-']","Here are twelve moving short stories about Taiwan and its people by one of the island's most popular writers, Cheng Ch'ing-wen. Focusing primarily on village life and the effects of modernization on Taiwan in the postwar years, Cheng is one of the most respected of the island's ""nativist"" writers, yet this is his first book to be translated into English. This anthology represents the best of his fictional efforts across a forty-year span and encompasses his major themes: the tensions between men and women, parents and children, city and village, tradition and modernity. Taken individually, each story presents a moving portrait of paralysis, frustration, or self-realization. Together, they weave a complex tapestry of life in a rapidly changing country.
<p>Cheng Ch'ing-wen's stories tell of men grappling with their fears and frustrations, from ""The River Suite,"" in which a ferryman-championed throughout his small town for twice saving a drowning person-lacks the courage to confess his love to a young woman before she dies, to ""Spring Rain,"" in which a man struggles to come to terms with his seemingly rootless life as both an orphaned child and an infertile husband. Here too are illustrations of the changing place of women in Taiwan, as they take on more powerful roles and awaken to a sense of their own sexuality: a woman forcibly separated from her husband by her jealous mother-in-law walks for hours through the night to see him on his birthday, only to turn back and go straight home before her absence is noticed; a disappointed young female scholar with a deformed hand comes to realize--after many painful rejections--that loneliness is not reason enough to become intimate with a man. And generations clash in ""Thunder God's Gonna Getcha,"" as a mother's cruelty is repaid years later by a son's coldness.</p>
<p>Death reverberates throughout these stories as characters recall deceased spouses, lovers, relatives, and friends in vivid detail. The focus, however, is not on the dead but on the living. In the title story, an old man carves exquisite lame horses as both a penance for having terrorized a town as a police officer during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan in World War II and a memorial to his deceased wife, who was nobler and more courageous than he. This book is a kind of gallery of three-legged horses: portraits of people maimed and transformed-for better or worse-by the suffering that life brings.</p>
<p><i>-The subtle gestures of the esteemed Cheng's first translated collection summon the ghosts of Taiwan's past. In twelve wistful stories, Cheng sketches characters who must reconcile their literal or cultural memories of Taiwan's politically unstable history with the routines of their modern lives. . . . Cheng's eye is sharp and keenly trained on the details of a changing society.</i> -Publishers Weekly <i>-Chekhov . . . would have understood the compassionate sensibility animating these gently harrowing, unpretentious, absorbing tales.</i> -Kirkus Reviews <i>-This collection of simple stories, written in simple language yet rich with vivid details, presents a gallery of portraits of disorientation, distortion, and frustration.</i> -New York Times Book Review</p>

Film As Film: Understanding And Judging Movies,['V. F. Perkins'],"Here at last is an introduction to film theory and its history without the jargon. Noted film scholar V. F. Perkins presents criteria for expanding our understanding and enjoyment of movies. He employs common sense words like balance, coherence, significance, and satisfaction to develop his insightful support of the subtle approach and of the unobtrusive director. Readers will learn why a scene from the humbler movie <i>Carmen Jones</i> is a deeper realization of filmmaking than the bravura lion sequence in the classic <i>Battleship Potemkin.</i> Along the way Perkins invites readers to re-experience with clarity, directness, and simplicity other famous scenes by directors like Hitchcock, Eisenstein, and Chaplin. Perkins examines the origins of movies and embraces their use of both realism and magic, their ability to record as well as to create. In the process he seeks to discover the synthesis between these opposing elements. With the delight of the fan and the perception of the critic, Perkins advances a film theory, based on the work of Bazin and other early film theorists, that is rich with suggestion for debate and further pursuit. Sit beside Perkins as he reacquaints you with cinema, heightens your awareness, deepens your pleasure, and increases your return every time you invest in a movie ticket."

Hidden In The Blood: A Personal Investigation Of Aids In The Yucatán,"['Wilson, Carter , 1941-']","Hidden in the Blood offers American readers a glimpse of the AIDS crisis on the Mexican front. Hidden in the Blood explores the daily lives of staff and patients at a clinic where three-quarters of HIV-positive people in the region are treated. Readers will come to know these patients, who come from a soberingly wide range of social and economic backgrounds - middle-aged fathers, married couples, transvestites, truck drivers, folklore dancers, a young woman infected by a blood transfusion during plastic surgery. In readable, lucid prose, Wilson recounts the heroic efforts of the clinic staff - doctors such as Alejandro Guerrero and Russell Rodriguez and nurses like Jose Manuel Polanco - as they struggle to treat their SIDA patients while coping with their lack of some of the latest diagnostic technology. Through the stories of these brave, caring staff members, readers will find evidence to dispel the common notion that Third-World medicine is a chamber of horrors. Wilson also explores the broad social context of AIDS in the Yucatan. Hidden in the Blood tells the stories of still-closeted homosexual men profoundly worried for their own survival and privacy, a conservative hematologist who mounted the first SIDA research effort in the peninsula, and the young men and women the crisis has moved to become activists.

"Unwrapping a Mummy: The Life, Death, and Embalming of Horemkenesi (title page Only)",['John H. Taylor'],"Horemkenesi was an Egyptian priest and official who lived at Thebes in the eleventh century BC. The unwrapping and scientific examination of his mummified body (the last such investigation to have been carried out in Britain) provided a rare opportunity to study the remains of a known historical figure using the most sophisticated technology and methods of analysis. By combining the results of this study with information from inscriptions on Horemkenesi's coffin and rock-graffiti recording his work in the cemeteries of Thebes it is possible to build up a fascinating picture of the life, death and mummification of an ancient Egyptian. The first part of this book considers Horemkenesi's life and work against the backdrop of Upper Egypt in the troubled times of the early Twenty-First Dynasty. The second part concentrates on the unwrapping of the mummy: its careful planning, how the delicate operation was carried out, and what discoveries were made. What did Horemkenesi look like? How old was he at death? What was the state of his health? Why did the embalmers not remove his brain and why were his internal organs missing? These and other questions are answered in this stimulating book."

The Preschool Resource Guide: Educating And Entertaining Children Aged Two Through Five,['Harriet Friedes'],"How can you find books and magazines that nurture a child's love of reading? Safe and long-lasting toys that inspire the imagination? Audiotapes of superior musical quality? Computer software that is appealing and age-appropriate? Videotapes of educational value? The Preschool Resource Guide is an extraordinary resource for parents, educators, and caregivers who need to locate quality educational items for young children. With her invaluable experience in working closely with children and their families, Harriet Friedes, M.A., has been able to gather materials that, in age-appropriate fashion, educate and entertain, give the most value for the money, and engage a child's active intellectual capacities. With selection criteria based on endorsements from professional associations, members of the media, educators, and parents, this book is carefully designed to feature the following: the best, brand-specific books, magazines, toys and games, computer software, audiotapes, and videotapes; relevant insights on behavioral development; a helpful checklist of skills for kindergarten readiness; an extensive array of free and inexpensive materials to promote creativity; and an annotated listing of parenting literature and support groups devoted to preschool issues. The Preschool Resource Guide is an especially well timed publication in light of today's trend for children to begin school at earlier ages, the increased emphasis on preschool education, and the expensive products of dubious value pitched to the consumer. As a cost-conscious alternative to this approach, Ms. Friedes has conveniently designed individual chapters as self-contained units that feature prime preschool materials and vital information needed to enhance an appreciation and enjoyment of learning between child and parent. This engaging, comprehensive book will be referred to repeatedly by parents and other family members, teachers and administrators of early childhood education, nursery and kindergarte"

How is the world to understand and respond to Hamas, the militant Islamist organization that Palestinian voters brought to power in the stunning election of January 2006?<br>
<br>
This important book provides the most fully researched assessment of Hamas ever written. Matthew Levitt, a counter-terrorist expert with extensive field experience in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, draws aside the veil of legitimacy behind which Hamas hides. He presents concrete, detailed evidence from an extensive array of international intelligence materials, including recently declassified CIA, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security reports.<br>
<br>
Levitt demolishes the notion that Hamas' military, political, and social wings are distinct from one another and catalogues the alarming extent to which the organization's political and social welfare leaders support terror. He exposes Hamas as a unitary organization committed to a militant Islamist ideology, urges the international community to take heed, and offers well-considered ideas for countering the significant threat Hamas poses."

Holding the center: memoirs of a life in higher education,"['Johnson, Howard Wesley , 1922-']","Howard Wesley Johnson has been associated with MIT for more than forty years and been a major influence on the modernization and expansion of many of its programs. He will be most remembered as a management educator and as MIT's president during the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s. The title of his memoirs reflects his central, usually lonely position in those days, trying to hold together an institution often torn apart by the turmoil of the times.
<p>Johnson was more successful at navigating the minefields on campus than were many other college and university presidents, perhaps because he was always willing to listen to both sides and because his values were in the right place—against the war in Vietnam, in favor of increased participation in the university by women and minorities, and concerned about environmental issues.</p>

Richard Rodgers,"['Hyland, William , 1929-']","Hyland's portrait of Rodgers (1902-79) begins with his childhood in an affluent Jewish family living in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. During college years at Columbia University and early work on the amateur circuit and Broadway, Rodgers entered into a historic collaboration with the lyricist Lorenz Hart. The team produced a dozen popular shows and such enduring songs as ""The Lady Is a Tramp."" Rodgers' next partnership, with Oscar Hammerstein II, led to the creation of the musical play, a new and distinctively American art form. Beginning with Oklahoma! in 1943, this pair dominated Broadway for almost twenty years with a string of hits that remain beloved favorites: Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I, and The Sound of Music. When Hammerstein died in 1960, Rodgers began a new phase in his career, writing the lyrics to his own music, then joining lyricists Stephen Sondheim, Sheldon Harnick, and Martin Charnin. Despite depression, excessive drinking, hypochondria, and devastating illness at different points in his life, Rodgers' outpouring of music seemed little affected, and he continued to compose until his death at age seventy-seven. An icon of the musical theater, Rodgers left a legacy of timeless songs that audiences return to hear over and again."
Children Of The Waters (modern Middle Eastern Literature In Translation Series),['Ibtihal Salem'],"Ibtihal Salem's writing provides an excellent forum for studying both everyday life in Egypt and current literary experimentation in the Middle East. Her poignant pieces hover between the structure of story-telling, the visuality of vignettes, and the compression of poetry. They both record and evoke a literary ferment going on in Egypt today.<br>
 Salem's writing of the last thirty years is lauded for its social messages also. Finding the expression of sexuality necessary to explicate problems of Egyptian identity, Salem often links poverty to gender marginality. Her heroines, however, celebrate the heritages that have shaped them, even as they resist certain aspects of them. Like many writers in Egypt, Salem honors traditional folktales, even as she deals with contemporary problems from class and economic perspectives.<br>
 Marilyn Booth, one of the best translators of Arabic fiction working today, has dealt in her introduction to this collection with the unusual experimental form by examining Salem's craft as well as the contextual history surrounding the stories. Since Salem is writing ""across genres,"" Booth helps the reader also by opening each piece with an explanatory comment, often quoting the author, and thus further illuminating Salem's portrayals of lives bounded by Egypt's waters--the Canal, the Nile, and the Mediterranean.<br>"
Poletown: Community Betrayed,"['Wylie, Jeanie , 1956-']","If a foreign government obliterated 465 acres in the middle of a major American city, causing the destruction of 144 local businesses, sixteen churches, two schools, and a hospital, it would mean war. Poletown tells what happened when these same actions were carried out by the City of Detroit and General Motors. Poletown is the story of the only group in Detroit to oppose the construction plan: the Poles and blacks who fought side by side to save their neighborhood, one of the city's oldest integrated communities."

"Tree Of Liberty: Radicalism, Catholicism, And The Construction Of Irish Identity, 1760-1830 (critical Conditions: Field Day Essays And Monographs)",['Kevin Whelan'],"If the 1790s can be seen as the pivotal decade in the evolution of modern Ireland, then an understanding of it is not just of scholarly interest, but has repercussions for current political and cultural debates. Precisely because of that enduring relevance, the 1790s have never passed out of politics into history. These essays look again at the window of opportunity which opened towards a non-sectarian, democratic and inclusive politics, adequately representing the Irish people in all their inherited complexities. These four new essays by this gifted and authoritative writer explain why that project was defeated and remains uncompleted. Understanding the reasons for its momentous defeat in the 1790s can help in ensuring that history does not repeat itself in the 1990s. Relieved of the disabling weight of confused meanings, the 1790s cease to be divisive. As the bicentenary of 1798 approaches the creation of an hospitable approach to all that it symbolizes becomes both desirable and necessary."
Looking For Carrascolendas: From A Child's World To Award-winning Television (louann Atkins Temple Women & Culture Series),['Aida Barrera'],"If your childhood friends were Agapito, the bombastic, bilingual lion; Campamocha, the fix-it man; Caracoles, the restaurant owner; Uncle Andy, the shoe seller; Berta and Dyana, the life-size dolls; and Señorita Barrera, then you grew up watching Carrascolendas. This award-winning show, which originally aired on PBS in the 1970s and was subsequently broadcasted throughout the country in the 1980s and 1990s, was the first Spanish and English children's educational television program broadcast to national audiences in the United States. 
<p>In this engagingly written memoir, creator-producer Aida Barrera describes how the mythical world of Carrascolendas grew out of her real-life experiences as a Mexican American child growing up in the Valley of South Texas. She recalls how she drew on those early experiences to create television programming that specifically addressed the needs of Hispanic children, even as it remained accessible and entertaining to children of other cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition to her personal story, Barrera recounts the long-term struggles for network acceptance and funding that made the production of Carrascolendas something of a miracle. This off-camera story adds an important chapter to the history of Anglo-Mexican cultural politics during the 1970s. Given the fact that Latino characters are still under- and stereotypically represented on network television, Carrascolendas remains an important reminder of what is possible and what has been lost in authentically multicultural television programming.<br>

Down The Asphalt Path: The Automobile And The American City,"['Mcshane, Clay.']","Imagine a world without automobiles, traffic lights, and interstate highways. Or the words commuter and parking. For a nation that prides itself on the freedom of movement and the long weekend, this seems nearly impossible. In Down the Asphalt Path, Clay McShane examines the uniquely American relation between automobility and urbanization. Writing at the cutting edge of urban and technological history, McShane focuses on how new transportation systems - most important, the private automobile - and new concepts of the city redefined each other in modern America. We swiftly motor across the country from Boston to New York to Milwaukee to Los Angeles and the suburbs in between as McShane chronicles the urban embrace of the automobile. McShane begins with mid-nineteenth-century municipal bans on horseless carriages, a response to public fears of accidents and pollution. After cities redesigned roads to encourage new forms of transport, especially trolley cars, light carriages, and bicycles, the bans disappeared in the 1890s. With the advent of the automobile, metropolitan elites quickly and permanently established cars as status symbols. Down the Asphalt Path also explains the escapist appeal of the motor car to many Americans constrained by traditional social values. This book includes more than thirty photographs detailing the transformation of urban transportation. They bring to life chapters on modes of travel before the trolley; the push for parks, parkways, and suburbanization; the car in popular culture; and the battle for traffic safety and regulation. McShane's analysis of gender relations in the rise of automobility - in particular, definitions of gender in terms of mechanical skill and of driving as male power - is both timely and innovative. Wonderfully readable, this book will be a treasure for readers of urban history, popular culture, and technology - as well as car buffs."
"The Persistence Of Ethnicity: Dutch Calvinist Pioneers In Amsterdam, Montana (statue Of Liberty Ellis Island)",['Rob Kroes'],"Immigration and ethnicity have long been staples of American history and literature, yet ethnicity has rarely been explored as the complex process of acculturation and adaptation that it is. In an adept combination of theoretical analysis and narrative, Rob Kroes presents the story of Amsterdam, Montana, a small, century-old village in the Gallatin Valley. Through extensive use of archival material, interviews with community members, and several months of first-hand experience living there, Kroes depicts the village's struggles for survival, its development as an ""American"" community, and, most important, its ability to maintain a strong Dutch ethnicity and culture through its ties to the Christian Reformed church. The reader sees the community as a whole as it moves through time, developing its many forms of accommodation to the surrounding American environment. There is a pervasive sense of the religion-based internal stratification and strife which, in the end, have served to draw the community more closely together as a solidly ethnic enclave. Amsterdam, Montana, is in America, but not quite of it."
Art Of Kitchen Design,"['Grey, Johnny.']","In <i>The Art of Kitchen Design,</i> leading kitchen architect Johnny Grey sounds a rousing note of liberation for the kitchen and shows, fascinatingly, that a kitchen can be efficient and contemporary yet at the same time offer traditional comforts and style as an elegant living space. 
<p>Johnny Grey find his inspiration from many sources, including the traditional country kitchens of rural Scandinavia, the American Arts and Crafts Movement and the farmhouse kitchens of Britain which evolved naturally as family rooms providing warmth, comfort and company as well as hearty meals for healthy country appetites. In his approach to kitchen design, he demonstrates that timeless freestanding dressers and cupboards can do as good or better a job than lookalike commercial kits, while being more responsive to the individual space concerned.</p>
<p> Lavishly illustrated throughout with over 150 super colour photographs, the book shows 'unfitted' kitchen solutions working in every type of kitchen space -- from large and lofty to small and awkward. As well as presenting case studies, it is full of intriguing new ideas that will interest not only anyone planning a new kitchen but also designers, architects, decorators and craft enthusiasts. Beautifully designed and produced, <i>The Art of Kitchen Design</i> combines tradition and contemporary designs in ways that will help every reader make their kitchen a joy to be in.</p>"
The Story Of My Life,"['Darrow, Clarence , 1857-1938']","In <i>The Story of My Life</i> recounts, and reflects on, his more than fifty years as a corporate, labor, and criminal lawyer, including the most celebrated and notorious cases of his day: establishing the legal right of a union to strike in the Woodworkers' Conspiracy Case; exposing, on behalf of the United Mine Workers, the shocking conditions in the mines and the widespread use of child labor; defending Leopold and Loeb in the Chicago ""thrill"" murder case; defending a teacher's right to present the Darwinian theory of evolution in the famous Scopes trial; fighting racial hatred in the Sweet anti-Negro and the Scottsboro cases; and much more. Written in his disarming, conversational style, and full of refreshingly relevant views on capital punishment, civil liberties, and the judicial system, Darrow's autobiography is a fitting final summation of a remarkable life."
The adventures of a cello,"['Prieto, Carlos , 1937-']","In 1720, Antonio Stradivari crafted an exquisite work of art-a cello known as the Piatti. Over the next three centuries of its life, the Piatti cello left its birthplace of Cremona, Italy, and resided in Spain, Ireland, England, Italy, Germany, and the United States. The Piatti filled sacred spaces, such as the Santa Cueva de Cádiz, with its incomparable voice. It also spent time in more profane places, including New York City bars, where it served as a guarantee for unpaid liquor tabs. The Piatti narrowly escaped Nazi Germany in 1935 and was once even left lying in the street all night. In 1978, the Piatti became the musical soul mate of world-renowned cellist Carlos Prieto, with whom it has given concerts around the world.<br>
 In this delightful book, Mr. Prieto recounts the adventurous life of his beloved “Cello Prieto,” tracing its history through each of its previous owners from Stradivari in 1720 to himself. He then describes his noteworthy experiences of playing the Piatti cello, with which he has premiered some eighty compositions. In this part of their mutual story, Prieto gives a concise summary of his own remarkable career and his relationships with many illustrious personalities, including Igor Stravinsky, Dmitry Shostakovich, Pablo Casals, Mstislav Rostropovich, Yo-Yo Ma, and Gabriel García Márquez.<br>
 To make the story of his cello complete, Mr. Prieto also provides a brief history of violin making and a succinct review of cello music from Stradivari to the present. He highlights the work of composers from Latin America, Spain, and Portugal, for whose music he has long been an advocate and principal performer. Thus, The Adventures of a Cello offers not only the first biography of a musical instrument but also an inviting overview of cello music and its preeminent composers and performers.<br>"
The Paris Years Of Thomas Jefferson,['William Howard Adams'],"In 1784 Thomas Jefferson moved to the sophisticated and exhilarating city of Paris, where he spent the next five years as minister from the new United States of America. These were formative years for France, for the United States, and for Jefferson's cultural and intellectual development. This engaging book recreates in word and illustration the atmosphere and personalities of prerevolutionary Paris, and it reveals the profound impact they had on one of America's first transatlantic citizens. Adam's principal focus is on Jefferson's role as the preeminent American envoy in Europe after the departure of Benjamin Franklin, his participation in the cultural and political life of the city, and his private intrigues to help his friends bring the Bourbon monarchy to heel. Finally, Adams places the author of the Declaration of Independence in the middle of his second revolution and chronicles the dramatic events leading to the upheaval of 1788-1789. The book is richly illustrated with art of the period and with specially commissioned photographs of Parisian sites by Adelaide de Menil."
When Hens Crow: The Woman's Rights Movement In Antebellum America,['Sylvia D Hoffert'],"In 1852 the New York Daily Herald described leaders of the woman's rights movement as ""hens that crow."" Using speeches, pamphlets, newspaper reports, editorials, and personal papers, Hoffert discusses how ideology, language, and strategies of early woman's rights advocates influenced a new political culture grudgingly inclusive of women. She shows the impact of philosophies of republicanism, natural rights, utilitarianism, and the Scottish Common Sense School in helping activists move beyond the limits of Republican Motherhood and the ideals of domesticity and benevolence. When Hens Crow also illustrates the work of the penny press in spreading the demands of woman's rights advocates to a wide audience, establishing the competency of women to contribute to public discourse and public life."
"Thomas Morris Chester, Black Civil War Correspondent (da Capo Paperback)",['R.j.m.

The only black correspondent for a major daily during the Civil War, Chester covered the crucial final year of the war around Richmond. His dispatches constitute the most sustained and extensive first-hand account of black soldiers in existence. As the war came to a close, Chester richly described the responses of Confederate troops and civilians to encounters with black soldiers, as he joined the black troops of the 25th Army Corps as they led the victorious Union forces into Richmond. In this volume, R.J.M. Blackett provides a concise biography of Chester and reproduces in annotated form his Civil War dispatches, which are remarkable for their detail and their graphic accounts of the destruction, the excitement and the liberation of theCivil War experience."
Bursting Bonds: The Autobiography Of A New Negro (african American Intellectual Heritage Series),['William Pickens'],"In 1911, William Pickens published the first edition of his autobiography, The Heir of Slaves, in which he recounts the experiences that led him into public life and the importance of his education. The narrative discusses his family, the various teachers and mentors who helped guide him, and the incidents and methods by which he accomplished so much. Pickens's later works increasingly demanded the rights of full citizenship for African Americans. Bursting Bonds (1923), the second edition of his autobiography, clearly demonstrates this development by the inclusion of five new chapters on racial tensions. This important work, now back in print, marks a turning point in the evolution of African American autobiography from deference to confrontation."
Cole Porter: A Biography,['Charles Schwartz'],"In 1933 Irving Berlin wrote to composer-lyricist Cole Porter, ”I am mad about <i>Night and Day</i>.” Millions of others throughout the world have been ”mad about” that Porter gem, as well as dozens of others, including, to name just a few, <i>Begin the Beguine, From This Moment On, It’s De-Lovely, Just One of Those Things, Love for Sale</i>, and <i>My Heart Belongs to Daddy</i>. Cole Porter (1891-1964) set new standards for popular song-writing, and his lyrics and melodies are as bright and sophisticated today as when they first dazzled audiences decades ago. Porter’s own life matched that of his songs for urbanity, wit, and elegance, and in New York, Hollywood, and on the Continent he was an arbiter of taste and fashion and part of the glamorous international set of the Twenties and Thirties. He numbered among his friends Cary Grant, Noel Coward, Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Elsa Maxwell, Fanny Brice, and Monty Woolley, as well as many other stars of stage, screen, or society. <i>Cole Porter: A Biography</i> is a delightfully written and meticulously researched book that takes us from the composer’s Indiana childhood to his celebrity days, discussing with exceptional honesty his family and friends, his wife and his many lovers, and above all, his music. Charles Schwartz’s account of Cole Porter is the most revealing, comprehensive, and objective biography to date of an extraordinarily talented and fascinating man."
The Peenemünde Wind Tunnels: A Memoir (studies In British Art),['Peter P. Wegener'],"In 1943, on orders from the German Air Ministry, young physicist Peter P. Wegener left the Russian front and reported to the Baltic village of Peenemunde. His assignment was to work at the supersonic wind tunnels of the rocket laboratories of the German Army. Here Wernher von Braun led a team that developed the V2, the world's first large rocket-powered guided missile, and laid much of the groundwork for postwar rocket development. In this fascinating book, Wegener recounts his experiences during Hitler's time, World War II, and his years at Peenemunde. Shortly before the end of the war, Wegener visited Germany's underground V2 production plant to retrieve archival material on aerodynamics that had been stored in caves for safekeeping."
Theory Of Deductive Systems And Its Applications (foundations Of Computing),['S. Yu. Maslov'],"In a fluent, clear, and lively style this translation by two of Maslov's junior colleagues brings the work of the late Soviet scientist S. Yu. Maslov to a wider audience. Maslov was considered by his peers to be a man of genius who was making fundamental contributions in the fields of automatic theorem proving and computational logic. He published little, and those few papers were regarded as notoriously difficult. This book, however, was written for a broad audience of readers and describes elegant examples of applications in such fields as computer science, artificial intelligence, operations research, economic modeling, and biological modeling, among others.
<p>The book also brings to light the work by the American mathematician E. L. Post, which inspired Maslov's own work in the development of a general theory and which has been long neglected by mathematicial logicians and systems theorists in the United States.</p>
<p>The book's first chapter introduces the Rules of the Game. Part I, Mathematics of Calculi, covers E. L. Post's canonical systems, deductive systems and algorithms, and probabilistic calculi and deductive information. Part II, Horizonal Modeling, takes up a ""toy"" economy, the calculi of technological possibilities, and the development of rules. Part III, Vertical Modeling, deals with the topics of ""to fight and to search"" and the consequences of the asymmetry of cognitive mechanisms.</p>

Every tub must sit on its own bottom,['Deborah G Plant'],"In a ground-breaking study of Zora Neale Hurston, Deborah Plant takes issue with current notions of Hurston as a feminist and earlier impressions of her as an intellectual lightweight who disregarded serious issues of race in American culture. Instead, Plant calls Hurston a writer of resistance who challenged the politics of domination both in her life and in her work. One of the great geniuses of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston stands out as a strong voice for African American women. Her anthropological inquiries as well as her evocative prose provide today's readers with a rich history of African American folk culture - a folk culture through which Hurston expressed her personal and political strategy of resistance and self-empowerment. Through readings of Hurston's fiction and autobiographical writings, Plant offers one of the first book-length discussions of Hurston's personal philosophy of individualism and self-reliance. From a discussion of Hurston's preacher father and influential mother, whose guiding philosophy is reflected in the title of this book, to the influence of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Plant puts into perspective the driving forces behind Hurston's powerful prose."
Iron Triangles And Revolving Doors: Cases In U.s. Foreign Economic Policymaking,"['Debora L.

This unique volume provides a close-up view of the decisionmaking process within the U.S. establishment as it has wrestled with a series of highly controversial economic issues in recent years. The book presents a model of the U.S. foreign economic policy decisionmaking process and details five case studies, each covering a well-publicized economic issue--including the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the FSX fighter co-development, and the Toshiba-Kongsberg Affair."
"Cats Of Any Color: Jazz, Black And White",['Gene Lees'],"In a series of candid interviews with jazz players, composers, and critics, Gene Lees explores racism in the past and present of jazz—both the white racism that for decades ghettoized black musicians and their music, and the prejudice that Lees documents of some black musicians against their white counterparts. With subjects ranging from Horace Silver to Dave Brubeck to Red Rodney, and a new introduction analyzing recent developments, <i>Cats of Any Color</i> chronicles jazz as a multiethnic art.

                        <p>The acclaimed author of three previous collections of essays on jazz and popular music takes a long overdue look at the shocking pervasiveness of racism in jazz's past and present. At the heart of this work is a passionate plea to recognize jazz not as the sole property of any one group, but as an art form celebrating the human spirit.

The New Majority: Toward A Popular Progressive Politics,"['Stanley B. Greenberg', 'Theda Skocpol']","In an era of widespread and unsettling change in families, businesses, and communities, most Americans yearn for a government that will take their side. The contributors to this bold and visionary book argue that America is ready for a progressive politics with substance and bite. They contend that by embarking on a popular progressive course, the Democratic Party can become the moral voice and practical partner of American families striving for a better life. This provocative book is a dialogue among Stanley B. Greenberg, Theda Skocpol, and other well-known thinkers. They reject conservative answers to America's most pressing problems - fraying social ties, hard-pressed families, sluggish economic growth, and widening gaps between the circumstances of the most privileged and those of everyone else. They urge a renewal of the nation's social contract, explain how to revitalize American democracy."
Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising And The 1960s,['Gerald Horne'],"In August 1965 the predominantly black neighborhood of Watts in Los Angeles erupted in flames and violence following an incident of police brutality. The official death toll was thirty-four; property losses reached hundreds of millions of dollars; but the political results were even more profound. The civil rights movement was placed on the defensive as the image of rioting blacks in the West replaced the image of meek and angelic protestors in the South. A white backlash ensued that led directly to Ronald Reagan's election as governor of California in 1966.This is the first comprehensive treatment of the uprising, its causes, and its aftermath, and is based on hundreds of oral histories and unprecedented archival research. With a cast that includes Ronald Reagan, Tom Bradley, Martin Luther King, Jr., Edmund G. Brown, the NAACP, the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, and thousands of blacks and whites, <i>Fire This Time</i> is a compelling account of an event that changed the face of racial justice in America."

Effeminate England,['Joseph Bristow'],"In Effeminate England, Joseph Bristow explores the legacy of effeminacy in homoerotic literature that began more than a century ago with the 1885 Labouchere Amendment criminalizing male homosexual contact and Oscar Wilde's subsequent incarceration. This broad overview looks into the century that followed these defining moments in the history of gay literature, demonstrating how the effeminate behavior that came to be connected so solidly with male homosexual identity has manifested itself in the literature of gay male writers in England. Effeminate England focuses closely on the works and lives of several prominent British literary figures of the past century, including E. M. Forster, John Addington Symonds, and Quentin Crisp. In a concluding section, Bristow evaluates the impact of the AIDS epidemic on gay men's writing and offers a thoughtful, original reading of Alan Hollinghurst's highly regarded recent novel, The Swimming Pool Library."

"The Organization Of Reduction, Data Flow, And Control Flow Systems (computer Systems)",['Werner Kluge'],"In light of research over the last decade on new ways of representing and performing computations, this book provides a timely reexamination of computer organization and computer architecture. It systematically investigates the basic organizational concepts of reduction, data flow, and control flow (or state transition) and their relationship to the underlying programming paradigms.
<p>For each of these concepts, Kluge looks at how princip1es of language organization translate into architectures and how architectural features translate into concrete system implementations, comparing them in order to identify their similarities and differences. The focus is primarily on a functional programming paradigm based on a full-fledged operational λ-calculus and on its realization by various reduction systems.</p>
<p>Kluge first presents a brief outline of the overall configuration of a computing system and of an operating system kernel, introduce elements of the theory of Petrinets as modeling tools for nonsequential systems and processes, and use a simple form of higher-order Petri nets to identify by means of examples the operational and control disciplines that govern the organization of reduction, data flow, and control flow computations. He then introduces the notions of abstract algorithms and of reductions and includes an overview of the theory of the λ-calculus. The next five chapters describe the various computing engines that realize the reduction semantics of a full-fledged λ-calculus. The remaining chapters provide self-contained investigations of the G-machine, SKI combinator reduction, and the data flow approach for implementing the functional programming paradigm. This is followed by a detailed description of a typical control flow (or von Neumann) machine architecture (a VAX11 system). Properties of these machines are summarized in the concluding chapter, which classifies them according to the semantic models they support.</p>"
After 9/11: photographs,"['Lyons, Nathan.']","In response to the tragic events of September 11, photographer Nathan Lyons-known for his honest and often questioning depictions of American culture-has created a poignant portfolio of images. Photographing in small towns and large cities, Lyons has captured the extreme and often confusing variety of responses-from deep reverence to blatant commercialization-manifested by ordinary Americans. One will marvel, for instance, at the myriad uses of the American flag. This provocative sequence of images with multiple messages is powerfully coherent and strangely disturbing. In the tradition of Robert Frank's The Americans, these photographs will engage audiences to question the responses to this horrific event in the context of our complicated society, along with memorializing the tragic loss of so many innocent lives.

The Phoenix and the Flame: Catalonia and the Counter Reformation,['Henry Kamen'],"In sixteenth-century Europe, culture and religious belief were so enmeshed that they informed and underpinned every act, however mundane, of every ordinary man or woman. But while the Reformation is acknowledged to have brought revolutionary change to Western society, the people of Catholic Europe have usually been regarded as little affected. Spain, in particular, is supposed to have escaped the winds of change entirely. Now, by considering the life of one small, but lively and distinctive, rural community - the Catalan village of Mediona - and the broader Mediterranean society of which it was part, Henry Kamen shows that, in fact, the Counter Reformation led to powerful changes in the dally life, belief and culture of the common people. Drawing exclusively on unpublished documents and on the wealth of books published during the period, the author looks at the popular culture of Catalan Spain, at the changes wrought by the Counter Reformation, at administrative reforms, the place of the community in religious belief, attempts to change popular festivities and celebrations, the far-reaching innovations in marriage and sexuality, the role of the Inquisition and of the Jesuits, the problem of witchcraft, and the impact of new ideas - introduced from abroad - on local language and the printed word. This pioneering study, the first of its kind on any Catholic society of the pre-industrial period, offers important new perspectives on the basis of the evidence for Catalonia, Spain's most vital and individual province. Kamen's Catalonia was a traditional society in which official dogma and morality played little part in everyday life, in which church marriage and the concept of Purgatory were little known, a society where control by the Inquisition was scorned, and extensive freedom of the Press survived. By contemplating popular religion and culture from the bottom rather than from the top, Henry Kamen offers new insights into an epoch normally studied and assessed o"
Gay And Gray,['Raymond M. Berger'],"In the absence of accurate information, American culture has upheld a distorted view of what it means to be an older gay man. Gay and Gray is the first and only scholarly full-length treatment of older gay men in America today.

No Apaches were killed, and the U.S. suffered heavy casualties. For the Apaches could travel seventy miles a day on foot, lay a deadly ambush in country so open a white man could not find a hiding place, and elude pursuit by scattering in every direction, only to reassemble as soon as the force was gone.

Our Joyce: From Outcast To Icon,"['Kelly, Joseph , 1962-']","In the beginning of his literary career, James Joyce was an Irishman writing to protest the deplorable, volatile conditions of his native country. Today, he is an icon revered as a literary genius within the academic cottage industry known as ""Joyce studies."" Our Joyce explores his amazing transformation of a literary reputation, offering an unusually frank look into how and for whose benefit literary reputations are constructed. One of only a few studies of literary reputations, Our Joyce will appeal to a broad range of literary critics and to nearly anyone who is interested in biography. Writing from within the Joyce industry that he analyzes, Kelly challenges our current view of James Joyce and the debilitating term 'genius' that we use to canonize writers."
"Collaboration, Reputation, And Ethics In American Academic Life: Hans H. Gerth And C. Wright Mills","['Oakes, Guy.']","In the course of exploring the history of the Gerth-Mills association, Guy Oakes and Author J. Vidich consider themes central to questions of academic ethics, including how the distribution of knowledge and power in collaboration shapes the social production of authorship, academic reputation, and intellectual authority; how the dynamics of collaboration play into the competition over credit for scientific and scholarly work; and how concealment, secrecy, and deception contribute to the building of academic reputation. Thus the historic partnership of Gerth and Mills serves as a point of departure for a sustained discussion of essential issues in the ethics and politics of academic life."
Life after welfare: reform and the persistence of poverty,"['Lein, Laura.']","In the decade since President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 into law--amidst promises that it would ""end welfare as we know it""--have the reforms ending entitlements and moving toward time limits and work requirements lifted Texas families once living on welfare out of poverty, or merely stricken their names from the administrative rolls?<br>
Under welfare reform, Texas has continued with low monthly payments and demanding eligibility criteria. Many families who could receive welfare in other states do not qualify in Texas, and virtually any part-time job makes a family ineligible. In Texas, most families who leave welfare remain in or near poverty, and many are likely to return to the welfare rolls in the future.<br>
This compelling work, which follows 179 families after leaving welfare, is set against a backdrop of multiple types of data and econometric modeling. The authors' multi-method approach draws on administrative data from nine programs serving low-income families and a statewide survey of families who have left welfare. Survey data on health problems, transportation needs, and child-care issues shed light on the patterns of employment and welfare use seen in the administrative data.<br>
In their lives after welfare, the families chronicled here experience poverty even when employed; a multiplicity of barriers to employment that work to exacerbate one another; and a failing safety net of basic human services as they attempt to sustain low-wage employment."

In this innovative and entertaining book, Adelson examines who made policy, on what grounds, with what information, and with what results -- identifying the virtual invention of the modern Middle East and the origins of the ethnic and nationalistic antagonisms that characterize the region today."
Spirited Women,['Joanne Watkins'],"In the Himalayan highlands of northern Nepal, the small group of Tibetan Buddhists known as the Nyeshangte have maintained a gender egalitarian social organization over many years. Nyeshangte women own land, control household money, and have the right to initiate divorce. Most important, they participate equally with men in central social institutions: international trade and Buddhist ritual practice. Spirited Women explores how the traditional culture of the Nyeshangte has confronted the changes brought about by modernization and the transition to a market economy, as the community has experienced a diaspora extending from the Himalayan highlands to such urban areas as Kathmandu, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Watkins argues that, while many studies have shown that capitalist development tends to lead to subordination of women, the Nyeshangte case demonstrates a marked divergence from this pattern. Because women are symbolically aligned with the domain of the sacred, their importance has actually increased in recent years, as the Nyeshangte struggle to reconcile their peaceful Buddhist tradition with the aggressive demands of the free market economy. In addition to its far-reaching exploration of women's agency in this small cultural group, Spirited Women looks into the lives of individual Nyeshangte men and women, both in their native Nepal and in the various urban centers where some have settled. Supplemented with photographs and regional maps, the first anthropological study of this fascinating cultural group adds an important chapter to the ethnographic record of Nepal."

Danger All Around: Waste Storage Crisis on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast,['Joel B. Goldsteen'],"In the next twenty-five years, the equivalent of more than 3,000 Astrodomes will be needed to hold the compacted trash and garbage of the Houston area alone. Depending on the depth of the waste, as much as thirty square miles could be filled by the cities of Dallas and New Orleans. The problem of where to store waste has grabbed a lot of headlines recently, but people have been slow to realize that the environmental damage caused by storage sites is an even greater menace. This book makes the danger clear, as Joel Goldsteen offers the first comprehensive look at the selection and environmental impact of municipal and petrochemical waste storage sites along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Goldsteen has distilled a large landfill-worth of data into a highly readable account of the creation and regulation of waste disposal sites, the health issues that surround them, and the human and natural factors that affect how safe or dangerous they become. Chapters that describe industrial development along the Gulf Coast and the concurrent challenges of wastewater treatment, solid waste management, and hazardous waste control are followed by in-depth descriptions of nine Texas and four Louisiana sites. The strength of DANGER ALL AROUND lies in the connection Goldsteen draws between land use planning and environmental protection. He documents how industrial facilities are usually located with little, if any, consideration for their impact on people and the environment, even though such facilities almost always produce toxic discharges. He offers hard evidence to local governments seeking to initiate permanent local regulatory change. In addition to charting the scope of the problem and the failure of federal and state authorities to deal with the waste storage crisis in more than piecemeal fashion, DANGER ALL AROUND offers possible solutions. Revisions to current comprehensive plans, zoning and subdivision ordinances, capital budgeting, the creation of local review boards,"
"Between Memory And Reality: Family And Community In Rural Wisconsin, 1870-1970 (history Of American Thought And Culture)",['Jane Marie Pederson'],"In the small communities of Wisconsin a rich blend of European cultures and practices survive. These communities and their people are unique in the ways they have responded to change in the late nineteenth century and twentieth century.
<p>Jane Marie Pederson looks at two neighboring rural communities, Lincoln and Pigeon Falls, in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin. ""Here,"" Pederson writes, ""families still live on the farms settled over a century ago, often on the land first tilled by a distant ancestor."" Building upon Merle Curti's classic work of social history set in the same county, The Making of an American Community, she tells a dramatically different story. Whereas Curti focused on the frontier years of this region, Pederson shows how distinct local ethnic cultures ""between memory and reality"" were established as communities changed and settled over the course of a century. She demonstrates the dynamic process of change these two communities experienced during the post-frontier years. Rather than developing into undifferentiated modern communities or becoming poorer and less sophisticated versions of urban culture, Lincoln and Pigeon Falls created their own distinct communities and cultures from a variety of sources.</p>
<p> These rural ethnic cultures were sustained into the second half of the twentieth century by rural women and men who actively shaped their own political economy, institutions, and mentality out of their memories of earlier traditions and from the opportunities and challenges of the rural American environment. Pederson pays particular attention to gender as a category of analysis, tracing the adaptation of traditional peasant courtship patterns and social rituals into the contemporary pattern of culture, work, and community.</p>"

"Return Passages: Great American Travel Writing, 1780-1910 : American Travel Writing From Exploration To Art","['Ziff, Larzer , 1927-']","In this arresting book, Larzer Ziff traces the history of distinctively American travel writing through the stories of five great representatives. John Ledyard (1752-1789) sailed with Captain Cook, walked across the Russian empire, and attempted to find a transcontinental route across North America. John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852), who today is recognized as the father of Maya archaeology, uncovered hundreds of ruins in two expeditions to the Yucatan and Central America, and he also was one of the first Americans to reach the Arabia Petrae. Bayard Taylor (1825-1878) invented travel writing as a profession. The only writer on Commodore Perry's expedition to Japan, he traveled also to Europe, Africa, India, and the Arctic Circle solely for the purpose of producing books about these journeys. Finally, in Mark Twain's unabashed concentration on the haps and mishaps of the tourist and Henry James's strikingly different cosmopolitan accounts of European sites and societies, travel writing conclusively emerged as great art.
<p>Ziff explains the ways in which the American background of these writers informed their impressions of foreign scenes and shows how America served always as the final object of the critical scrutiny they brought to bear on other people and their lands.<br>

The Bolsheviks In Russian Society: The Revolution And The Civil Wars,"['Brovkin, Vladimir N.', 'Rossiĭskai︠a︡ Kommunisticheskai︠a︡ Partii︠a︡ (bolʹshevikov)']",In this book distinguished scholars from East and West draw on recently opened archives to challenge the commonly held view that the Bolsheviks enjoyed widespread support and that their early history was simply a march toward inevitable victory. They show instead that during this period Russian society was at war with itself and with the Bolsheviks.
The Holy War Idea In Western And Islamic Traditions (occasional Papers),['James  Turner Johnson'],"In this book James Turner Johnson explores the cultural traditions of the Christian West and Islam, in an effort to encourage a constructive dialogue on the nature of war for religion. No other issue highlights the difference between these two cultures more clearly or with more relevance for their interrelations throughout history and in the contemporary world.
<p>In the West, war for religion is most often dismissed as a relic of the past. By contrast, war for religion has an honored place in the Islamic world, associated with a perennial religious requirement: striving in the path of faith by heart, tongue, and hands, designated by the now familiar term jihad. According to Johnson, we must understand that in the West religion and politics are placed in separate spheres, while normative Islam regards religion as properly integral to the political order. From this perspective religious concerns should have a place in statecraft, including the use of military force.</p>
<p>Three questions form the heart of Johnson's inquiry: Is there a legitimate justification of war for religion? What authority is required? What is the proper conduct in such wars? In each case, he asks the question by comparing religious wars with other kinds of wars. The picture that emerges is of war for religion not as an expression of fanatical excess but as a controlled, purposeful activity. With an eye to the present day, Johnson examines cases in history where distinctive models of war for religion were implemented by rulers. This in turn sets the stage for critical judgment on contemporary appeals to the idea of jihad in relation to political aims.</p>
<p>Well known for his work on peace and just war, Johnson draws upon awide base of historical and comparative scholarship. While the book is anchored primarily on the historical development of the two traditions, he aims throughout to shed light on contemporary attitudes, ideals, and behaviors, especially as they bear on real problems that affect relations between Western and Islamic cultures in the world today.</p>"

"The Continuing Storm: Iraq, Poisonous Weapons, And Deterrence",['Avigdor Haselkorn'],"In this book strategic analyst Avigdor Haselkorn provides an important reassessment of the 1991 Gulf War. Haselkorn's step-by-step narrative - in which he reviews the events of the war with Iraq, examines intelligence and planning during the war, discusses why President Bush abruptly terminated it, and analyzes the strategic consequences - is absorbing and frightening. He reveals that the war was not the splendid high-tech victory that many Americans perceive, but a nearly catastrophic event. The threatened use of weapons of mass destruction during the Gulf War has redefined the meaning of deterrence, Haselkorn contends, and has set in motion trends that portend great danger to world peace. This book focuses on the role played by biological and chemical weapons in the Gulf War and scrutinizes the dynamics of deterrence. It supplies the grim facts about anthrax, botulinum toxin, and poison gases and traces the terror of their use. Haselkorn shows that President Bush had little choice about ending the war when he did, given the failure of U.S. intelligence and severe flaws in strategic planning. Indeed, leaders on both sides of the conflict either were dangerously uninformed or did not fully understand the information they had. This book provides a key to the continuing stalemate with Iraq, and it offers new insights into how the spread of weapons of mass destruction will affect world politics and future battlefields."
"Education, Society, And Economic Opportunity: A Historical Perspective On Persistent Issues",['Maris A. Vinovskis'],"In this book, an eminent educational historian examines some important aspects of American schooling over the past centuries, illuminating the relation between education and other broad changes in American society and providing a historical perspective for contemporary efforts at school reform.
<p>Maris Vinovskis critically reviews and integrates recent work in educational history and provides new research on neglected topics. He discusses such issues as: the gradual shift from the family to the public schools in the responsibility for educating the young; the rise and fall of infant schools between 1840 and 1860; the crisis in the teaching of morality in the public schools of the mid-nineteenth century; early efforts to provide schooling for impoverished children; and the evolution of the belief that education improves individual economic and social mobility. He also studies school attendance and discovers that a much higher percentage of children may have attended public high schools in the nineteenth century than has been assumed, investigates when the practice of placing children in grades according to their age became widespread, and assesses whether different age groups in previous eras varied in their support for schooling-as they seem to be doing now.</p>"
Small Change,['Andrea H. Beller'],"In this book, Andrea H. Beller and John W. Graham discuss what went right and what went wrong with child support payments during the 1980s, investigating the socioeconomic and legal factors that determined child support awards and receipts, documenting why few gains were made in child support overall, and offering policy recommendations for the future."
New Schools For A New Century: The Redesign Of Urban Education,"['Diane Ravitch', 'Joseph P. Viteritti']","In this book, distinguished scholars discuss recent controversial innovations - charter schools, contracting arrangements, and choice - designed to liberate educators from burdensome bureaucratic controls and raise the level of opportunity for all children. The authors focus on the problems in cities, where far too many children have been denied access to quality institutions. Various essays explore the lessons to be learned from Catholic schools, site-based management, and private entrepreneurs, as well as specific developments in three cities - New York, Milwaukee, and Chicago. The contributors, though realistic about the political and institutional obstacles that stand in the way of meaningful change, foresee the demise of the ""one size fits all"" approach to schooling. They envision a system of schools that is dynamic, diverse, performance-based, and accountable - one that is supportive of professionals, responsive to creativity, intolerant of failure, and committed to high educational standards for all children."
Psychology And Religion,"['Jung, C. G. (carl Gustav) , 1875-1961']","In this book, Dr. Jung, who has been the author of some of the most provocative hypotheses in modern psychology, describes what he regards as an authentic religious function in the unconscious mind. Using a wealth of material from ancient and medieval gnostic, alchemistic, and occultistic literature, he discusses the religious symbolism of unconscious processes and the possible continuity of religious forms that have appeared and reappeared through the centuries."
The Nature Of Work: Sociological Perspectives (american Sociological Association),"['Kai T. Erikson', 'Steven P. Vallas']","In this book, leading authorities discuss the changing nature of work in America.

Gobi: Tracking The Desert,"['Man', 'John']","In this book, MacMullen investigates the transition from paganism to Christianity between the fourth and eighth centuries. He reassesses the triumph of Christianity, contending that it was neither tidy nor quick, and he shows that the two religious systems were both vital during an interactive period that lasted far longer than historians have previously believed.<br>"
"The Invisible Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, The Personal Computer Is So Complex, And Information Appliances Are The Solution",['Donald A. Norman'],"In this book, Norman shows why the computer is so difficult to use and why this complexity is fundamental to its nature. The only answer, says Norman, is to start over again, to develop information appliances that fit people's needs and lives. To do this companies must change the way they develop products. They need to start with an understanding of people: user needs first, technology last - the opposite of how things are done now. Companies need a human-centered development process, even if it means reorganizing the entire company. This book shows why and how."

Bridge Across Broken Time: Chinese And Jewish Cultural Memory,"['Schwarcz, Vera , 1947-']","In this book, Vera Schwarcz explores the meanings of cultural memory within the two longest surviving civilizations on earth. Schwarcz finds a bridge between the vastly different Chinese and Jewish traditions in the fierce commitment to historical memory they share. Focusing on the transmission of cultural memory in these two cultures, the author examines how metaphor becomes an aid to memory, how personal remembrance plays a role in public commemorations, and how historical wounds are healed."
Portraits From The Desert: Bill Wright's Big Bend,['Bill Wright'],"In this book, Wright combines photographs with text to offer an intimate portrait of the people and the land of the Big Bend. Covering an almost-fifty-year span, his words and images capture both the timeless quality of the region and the changes that have followed in the wake of increasing tourism and human settlement. The heart of the book is Wright's portraits of the people who have added unique chapters to the Big Bend story. From artist Donald Judd, who found the perfect setting for his work in Marfa, to Terlingua and Lajitas residents who gladly forego urban amenities, to the Mexican villagers who have offered him hospitality, Wright explores why so many people have developed an almost mythic attachment to the Big Bend."
Reading Dante's Stars,['Alison Cornish'],"In this brief, tightly composed book Cornish examines Dante's frequent use of descriptions of the heavens and analogies based on astronomy throughout the Divine Comedy.

He tells how he first became interested in architecture, describes the country houses which he visited as a boy, provides an authoritative interpretation of the origins of English rococo art, analyzes the formation of an English seaside resort, recreates the Georgian architecture and polite society of Jane Austen's world, and traces changing attitudes toward the landscape in architecture from eighteenth-century Britain to twentieth-century America. Old Slaughter's Coffee-House in the mid-eighteenth century; Holdenby, an Elizabethan great house built by a royal favourite who was called by one of his contemporaries ""a mere vegetable of the court that sprung up at night and sank again at noon""; Belvedere, the eighteenth-century Irish country house that was witness to a tragic story of adultery and revenge: these are just a few of the buildings described by Girouard in these delightful essays on architecture and society in bygone eras in England and Ireland. Written with his customary wit and elegance, this collection of Girouard's finest essays illuminates not only architecture and social history but also the man who has explored both with such elan."
The American Paradox: Spiritual Hunger In An Age Of Plenty,['David G. Myers'],"In this compelling book, well-known social psychologist David G. Myers asks why in an era of great material wealth America suffers from such a disturbing array of social problems and a deep spiritual poverty.

"When Toys Come Alive: Narratives Of Animation, Metamorphosis, And Development",['Lois Rostow Kuznets'],"In this extraordinary book, Lois Rostow Kuznets studies the role of toy characters in works ranging from older classics like Pinocchio, Winnie the Pooh, and The Velveteen Rabbit, through modern texts like The Mouse and His Child and the popular comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, to the latest science fiction featuring robots and cyborgs. He examines how toys can often take on a secret, sensual, even carnivalesque life of their own and how they tend to evoke a romantic nostalgia that supports the underlying values and hierarchies of a patriarchal society."
Kenneth And John B. Rayner And The Limits Of Southern Dissent,"['Cantrell, Gregg , 1958-']","In this fascinating story of two nineteenth-century southern political mavericks, Gregg Cantrell details their fate as dissenters, telling a human story at once heroic and shameful, hopeful and tragic. The two mavericks were the slaveholding congressman and planter Kenneth Rayner of North Carolina and his illegitimate mulatto son, John B. Rayner of Texas. Born in 1808, Kenneth served in the North Carolina legislature for twenty years and in Congress for six as a Whig. In 1854 he became a major leader of the American Know-Nothing party. His staunch Unionism and a willingness to cooperate with Republicans incurred the wrath of his fellow southerners. After supporting secession, working for a peace settlement during the war, writing a biography of Andrew Johnson, and going broke in a grandiose cotton-planting venture, he joined the Republican parry and held federal offices in the Grant, Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur administrations. Kenneth Rayner's son, John, was born in 1850. His mother was a slave. The elder Rayner acknowledged his paternity and provided a college education. John held local offices in North Carolina during Reconstruction, then led a migration of black farmworkers to Texas in 1880. There he preached, taught school, and took part in his adopted state's prohibition battles. A master orator, he joined the Populist party in 1892 and soon became its preeminent black leader. After the turn of the century blacks were disfranchised and Rayner, like his father before him, found his political career in ruins. He spent the rest of his days working for black education and trying to preserve some voice for blacks in southern politics. Both men were out of step with the rapidly changing politics of their time. Each eventually compromised his principles and personal dignity in futile efforts to salvage a way of life that earlier actions had jeopardized. Both were devoted to traditional republican principles, which estranged them from the South's major politica"
"The Road To Stalingrad: Stalin`s War With Germany, Volume One",['John Erickson'],"In this first volume of John Erickson's monumental history of the grueling Soviet-German war of 1941-1945, the author takes us from the pre-invasion Soviet Union, with its inept command structures and strategic delusions, to the humiliating retreats of Soviet armies before the Barbarossa onslaught, to the climactic, grinding battle for Stalingrad that left the Red Army poised for its majestic counteroffensive.<br>"
The Princes Of Naranja: An Essay In Anthrohistorical Method,['Paul Friedrich'],"In this groundbreaking study, Paul Friedrich looks closely at the strong men of the Tarascan Indian village of Naranja: their leadership, friendship, kinship, and violent local politics (over a time depth of one generation), and ways to understand such phenomena. What emerges is an acutely observed portrait of the men who form the very basis of the grass-roots power structure in Mexico today.<br>
 Of interest to historians, sociologists, and political scientists, as well as Latin Americanists and anthropologists, The Princes of Naranja is a sequel to Friedrich's now classic Agrarian Revolt in a Mexican Village. It begins with biographical character studies of seven leaders--peasant gunmen, judges, politicos; here the book will grip the reader and provoke strong emotional response, from laughter to horror. A middle section places these ""princes"" in relation to each other, and to the contexts of village society and the larger entities of which it forms a part. Friedrich's synthesis of anthropology, local (mainly oral) history, macrohistory, microsociology, psychology, and literature gives new insight into the structure of Mexican politics from the local level up, and provides a model for other scholars doing analogous work in other parts of the world, especially in the developing world. The concluding section raises vital questions about the dynamic relations between the fieldworker, fieldwork, field notes, the villagers, the writing of a fieldwork-based book, and, implicitly, the audience for such books."
Medicine's Dilemmas: Infinite Needs Versus Finite Resources (yale Fastback Series),['William Kissick'],"In this important book on the American health care system, a physician and expert in health care management, who helped draft the Medicare legislation, discusses the dimensions of the current crisis and the financial and medical implications of alternative proposals and offers long term strategies for addressing the problem.<br>

Surviving Freedom. After The Gulag.,"['Janusz And Gleeson, Kathleen: Bardach']","In this important book, a distinguished United States Army officer and scholar traces the rise and fall of the Soviet military, arguing that it had a far greater impact on Soviet politics and economic development than was perceived in the West. General Odom asserts that Gorbachev saw that dramatically shrinking the military and the military-industrial sector of the economy was essential for fully implementing perestroika and that his efforts to do this led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union."
"Like Subjects, Love Objects: Essays On Recognition And Sexual Difference",['Ms. Jessica Benjamin'],"In this important book, a well-known psychoanalyst and feminist makes a case for what she calls ""gender heterodoxy""-a highly original view of the similarities and differences between the sexes-and, in the process, illuminates aspects of love, sexuality, aggression, and pornography.<br>"
Deliberative democracy and human rights,['Harold Koh'],"In this important collection of writings, leading legal and political thinkers address a wide array of issues that confront societies undergoing a transition to democratic rule. Bridging the gap between theory and practice in international human rights law and policy, the contributors continue discussions that were begun with the late Argentine philosopher-lawyer Carlos Santiago Nino, then extend those conversations in new directions inspired by their own and Nino's work.
<p>The book focuses on some of the key questions that confront the international human rights movement today. What is the moral justification for the concept and content of universal human rights? What is the relationship among nation-building, constitutionalism, and democracy? What are the political implications for a conception of universal human rights? What is the relationship between moral principles and political practice? How should a society confront what Kant called radical evil? And how does a successor regime justly and practically hold a prior regime accountable for gross violations of human rights?</p>"

The Ancients And The Moderns: Rethinking Modernity,['Professor Stanley Rosen'],"In this insightful and controversial book, the eminent philosopher Stanley Rosen takes a new look at the famous 'quarrel' that the moderns have with the ancients, analyzing and comparing ancient philosophers and modern Continental and analytical thinkers from Plato, Descartes, and Kant to Fichte, Nietzsche, and Rorty. He urges that we do not dismiss the classical heritage but appropriate it, for this appropriation is an indispensable step in the process of legitimizing our historical experience."
Lbj And The Presidential Management Of Foreign Relations (administrative History Of The Johnson Presidency),['Paul Y. Hammond'],"In this insightful study, Paul Y. Hammond, an experienced analyst of bureaucratic politics, adapts and extends that approach to explain and evaluate the Johnson administration's performance in foreign relations in terms that have implications for today's post-Cold War era. The book is structured around three case studies of Johnson's foreign policy decision making. The first study examines economic and political development. It explores the way Johnson handled the provision of economic and food assistance to India during a crisis in India's food policies. This analysis provides lessons not only for dealing with African famine in recent years but also for assisting Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The second case study focuses on U.S. relations with Western Europe at a time that seemed to require a major change in the NATO alliance. Here, Hammond illuminates the process of policy innovation, particularly the costs of changing well-established policies that embody an elaborate network of established interests. The third case study treats the Vietnam War, with special emphasis on how Johnson decided what to do about Vietnam. Hammond critiques the rich scholarship available on Johnson's advisory process, based on his own reading of the original sources. These case studies are set in a larger context of applied theory that deals more generally with presidential management of foreign relations, examining a president's potential for influence on the one hand and the constraints on his or her capacity to control and persuade on the other. It will be important reading for all scholars and policymakers interested in the limits and possibilities of presidential power in the post-Cold War era."
Sir Francis Drake: The Queen`s Pirate,['Mr. Harry Kelsey'],"In this lively and engaging new biography, Harry Kelsey shatters the familiar image of Sir Francis Drake. The Drake of legend was a pious, brave, and just seaman who initiated the move to make England a great naval power and whose acts of pirac against his country's enemies earned him a knighthood for patriotism. Kelsey paints a different and far more interesting picture of Drake as an amoral privateer at least as interested in lining his pockets with Spanish booty as in forwarding the political goals of his country, a man who became a captain general of the English navy but never waged traditional warfare with any success.
<p>Drawing on much new evidence, Kelsey describes Drake's early life as the son of a poor family in sixteenth-century England. He explains how Drake dabbled in piracy, gained modest success as a merchant, and then took advantage of the hostility between Spain and England to embark on a series of daring pirate raids on undefended Spanish ships and ports, preempting Spanish demands for punishment by sharing much of the his booty with the Queen and her councillors. Elizabeth I liked Drake because he was a charming rogue, and she made him an integral part of her war plans against Spain and its armada, but she quickly learned not to trust him with an important command: he was unable to handle a large fleet, was suspicious almost to the point of paranoia, and had no understanding of personal loyalty. For Drake, the mark of success was to amass great wealth---preferably by taking it from someone else---and the primary purpose of warfare was to afford him the opportunity to accomplish this.</p>"
"Husbands, Wives and Lovers: Marriage and Its Discontents in Nineteenth-Century France",['Patricia Mainardi'],"In this lively, interdisciplinary exploration of the cultural and social history of early nineteenth-century France, art historian Patricia Mainardi focuses on what was considered a major social problem of the time-adultery. In a period when expectations about marriage were changing, the problems of husbands, wives, and lovers became a major theme in theater, literature, and the visual arts. The author demonstrates that this intense interest was historically grounded in the post-Revolutionary collision between the new concept of the individual's right to happiness and the traditional prerogatives of family and state. The book examines the questions that permeated French culture and society: Is duty or happiness more important? Are arranged marriages doomed to be empty of love and poisoned by adultery? Should adulterous wives and their lovers be punished while husbands may commit adultery with impunity? Out of such legal, social, and cultural debates ultimately emerged modern bourgeois family values, Mainardi argues. And she illuminates how art, in all its varieties, both influences and is influenced by social change.<p>Author Biography: Patricia Mainardi is professor of art history and executive officer (chair) of the doctoral program in art history at the Graduate Center, The City University of New York.</p>"
The Rise and Fall of English: Reconstructing English As a Discipline,['Robert E.

What Johnny Shouldn't Read: Textbook Censorship In America,"['Delfattore, Joan , 1946-']","In this lucid, disturbing, and provocative book, Joan Delfattore offers a behind-the-scenes view of the ways in which special-interest groups influence the content of textbooks used in public and private schools throughout the country. Efforts to censor elementary and high school textbooks have proliferated in the past decade. Most challenges have come from ultraconservative activists who oppose evolution, racial and ethnic equality, nontraditional gender roles, pacifism, and a host of other issues that contradict their religious, political, or social views. Other protests originate with ultraliberal activists whose goal is to eliminate all negative or traditional descriptions of racial, ethnic, religious, or gender groups, without regard for accuracy or historical context. DelFattore focuses on recent federal lawsuits involving attempts to censor or ban biology, geology, history, home economics, literature, psychology, reading, and social studies textbooks. She vividly re-creates the story behind each lawsuit, describing how politically sophisticated national organizations turn local controversies into nationally publicized court cases. She also discusses how both ultraliberal and ultraconservative groups in Texas and California pressure their state Boards of Education to demand that sections of textbooks be eliminated or rewritten as a condition of selling the books in those states. Because California and Texas are such important markets, says DelFattore, publishers almost always make the required changes in the books, which are then sold nationwide. As a result, the content of American textbooks is heavily influenced by political and economic forces as well as by educational considerations. DelFattore's investigation has profound implications not only for education but also for freedom of thought in the larger society. Her book will be mandatory reading for parents, teachers, school administrators, lawyers, librarians, and other concerned citizens."
"Giordano Bruno And The Kabbalah: Prophets, Magicians, And Rabbis","['Deleón-jones, Karen Silvia.']","In this major new interpretation of the thought of the heretical philosopher Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), Karen de Leon-Jones depicts the influential thinker as mystic and Kabbalistic. She rejects the popular view of Bruno as Hermetic magus - a position initiated by Frances Yates and widely accepted by succeeding scholars. Bruno's interest in mysticism and the Kabbalah was not merely intellectual or satiric, de Leon-Jones contends: a close look at his study of the Kabbalah reveals him as a practicing believer. This book sets Bruno's thought in the context of the widespread interest in non-Christian religions in fifteenth- and sixteenth century Italy. His quest for an alternative model to the strict spirituality of post-Reformation churches, for a way to encompass both scientific and mystical views of the universe, led Bruno to the Kabbalah. De Leon-Jones argues that Bruno's dialogue Cabala del cavallo (Kabbalah of the pegasean horse) expressed his mystical, kabbalistic doctrine. For Bruno, the Kabbalah reconciled science with theology and provided a biblical support for theories such as metempsychosis that he wished to prove scientifically through atomic theory and physiognomy. Balancing his mystical Cabala dialogue with the Hermetic vein of his dialogue Spaccio della bestia trionfante and the Napoleonic emblems of De'li eroici furori, Bruno creates a solid syncretic trilogy, as well as a strikingly modern apology for scientific and philosophical debates still of interest today."
Crimes Of The Middle Classes: White Collar Offenders In The Federal Courts,"['Weisburd', 'David', 'Stanton Wheeler', 'Elin Waring And Nancy Bode']","In this major study of convicted white-collar offenders in America, Weisburd, Wheeler, Waring, and Bode show that, contrary to public assumption, the majority of white-collar criminals are not wealthy but come from the middle classes and that judges are not more lenient with these offenders but often punish them more harshly than less socially privileged criminals."
Migrant Song: Politics and Process in Contemporary Chicano Literature,['Teresa McKenna'],"In this pathfinding study of Chicano literature, Teresa McKenna specifically explores how these works arise out of social, political, and psychological conflict and how the development of Chicano literature is inextricably embedded in this fact."
Environmental Cancer_a Political Disease?,"['S. Robert Lichter', 'Stanley Rothman']","In this provocative book, S. Robert Lichter and Stanley Rothman examine the controversies surrounding environmental cancer and place them in historical perspective. Then, drawing on surveys of cancer researchers and environmental activists, they reveal that there are sharp differences between the two groups' viewpoints on environmental cancer. Despite these differences, a further comparison - between the views of the two groups and the content of television and newspaper accounts over a two-decade period - shows that press reports most frequently cite the views of environmental activists as if they were the views of the scientific community. These findings cast doubt on the objectivity of the news media and environmental activists. And, the authors conclude, misplaced fears about the risks of environmental cancer have seriously distorted public policy and priorities."
Probabilistic Similarity Networks (acm Doctoral Dissertation Award),['David Heckerman'],"In this remarkable blend of formal theory and practical application, David Heckerman develops methods for building normative expert systems—expert systems that encode knowledge in a decision-theoretic framework.
<p>Heckerman introduces the similarity network and partition, two extensions to the influence diagram representation. He uses the new representations to construct Pathfinder, a large, normative expert system for the diagnosis of lymph-node diseases. Heckerman shows that such expert systems can be built efficiently, and that the use of a normative theory as the framework for representing knowledge can dramatically improve the quality of expertise that is delivered to the user. He concludes with a formal evaluation of the power of his methods for building normative expert systems. David Heckerman is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California. He received his doctoral degree in Medical Information Sciences from Stanford University.</p>

"Dryden And The Problem Of Freedom: The Republican Aftermath, 1649-1680","['Haley, David , 1936-']","In this revisionary study of Dryden's thought, David Haley argues that Dryden was the first English poet after Shakespeare to engage in historical reflection upon his own culture. Addressing an audience for whom literature was bound up with religion and politics, Dryden exercised the moral integrity of a public poet and brought home to his readers the meaning of their historical experience."

"Life In The Ancient Near East, 3100-332 B.c.e.",['Daniel C. Snell'],"In this sweeping overview of life in the ancient Near East, Daniel Snell surveys the history of the region from the invention of writing five thousand years ago to Alexander the Great's conquest in 332 B.C.E. The book is the first comprehensive history of the social and economic conditions affecting ordinary people and of the relations between governments and peoples in ancient Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. To set Near East developments in a broader context, the author also provides brief contrasting views of India, China, Greece, and Etruscan Italy. Snell organizes his book chronologically in time spans of about five hundred years and considers broad continuities. Drawing on the latest scholarship in many fields and in many languages, he sets forth a detailed picture of what is known about the demography, social groups, family, women, labor, land and animal management, crafts, trade, money, and government of the ancient Near East. For general readers with an interest in historical events that have influenced the development of Europe and the Middle East, for specialists seeking a broader understanding of early periods of Middle Eastern history, and for anyone with an interest in the Bible, this book offers a fascinating tour of life in ancient Western Asia."
"The Shaping Of America: A Geographical Perspective On 500 Years Of History, Volume 3: Transcontinental America, 1850-1915",['D. W. Meinig'],"In this third volume of his acclaimed series, D. W. Meinig offers a riveting account of the expanding country's development from mid-nineteenth century to the onset of World War I. Beginning with the struggle over where to build the Pacific railway, the book details the settlement of the American West, the nation's increasing consolidation, and America's imperialist efforts in the Caribbean and Pacific. Forty superb new maps accompany the account. .<br>"
"Adoption, Identity, and Kinship: The Debate over Sealed Birth Records",['Katarina Wegar'],"In this thoughtful book, sociologist Katarina Wegar offers a new perspective on adoption and the search debate, placing them within a social context. She argues that Americans who are embroiled in adoption controversies have failed to understand how much the debate, adoption research, and the experience of adoption itself are affected by persistent social beliefs that adopted children are different from and somehow inferior to children reared by their biological families. Wegar begins by considering the historical and legal development of adoption and of sealed-records policies, showing how kinship ideology, the helping professions, and gender issues intersect to frame adoption policies and the ongoing debate. Drawing on articles in social work and mental health journals, activist newsletters, and autobiographies by search activists, as well as on popular images of adoption portrayed in talk shows and other media, she analyzes the rhetoric to reveal the unconscious biases that exist. She concludes with a discussion of ways in which adoption reformers can avoid perpetuating harmful and confining images of those who participate in adoption."
Democratic Vistas: Reflections On The Life Of American Democracy,"['Jedediah Purdy', 'Anthony T. Kronman', 'Cynthia Farrar']","In this thought-provoking collection, leading scholars explore democracy in the United States from a sweeping variety of perspectives. A dozen contributors consider the nature and prospects of democracy as it relates to the American experience-free markets, religion, family life, the Cold War, higher education, and more. These probing essays bring American democracy into fresh focus, complete with its idealism, its moral greatness, its disappointments, and its contradictions.Based on DeVane lectures delivered at Yale University, these writings examine large themes and ask important questions: Why do democratic societies, and the U.S. in particular, tolerate profound economic inequality? Has the United States ever been truly democratic? How has democratic aspiration influenced the development of practices as diverse as education, religious worship, and family life? With deep insights and lively discussion, the authors expand our understanding of what democracy has meant in the past, how it functions now, and what its course may be in the future."
"The Real Shakespeare: Retrieving The Early Years, 1564-1594",['Eric Sams'],"In this vivid and meticulous account of the first thirty years of Shakespeare's life, Eric Sams controverts all orthodox editions, biographies and reference books. He reveals how, in conventional Shakespeare scholarship, the reality of the playwright's youth has been concealed within a web of elaborate literary theories which misrepresent his life and work, and reject, ignore, or misdate his early plays. Pioneering a revolution in our understanding of the early years, Sams exposes the gulf between the accepted view and documented fact. Analysing the evidence carefully and thoroughly, he reveals Shakespeare to have been a disadvantaged country boy from an illiterate Catholic background, removed from school at the age of about thirteen to help on the family farm. Far from being a late developer, as conventionally portrayed, he was a husband and father at eighteen, and an actor and writer of popular plays soon afterwards. Sams traces the impact of Shakespeare's upbringing in the language and imagery of his early comedies, histories and tragedies, not only those of the Folio editions but others, including the so-called 'Bad Quartos', widely but wrongly assumed to have been the result of 'memorial reconstruction by actors'. Through detailed textual analysis, he argues compellingly against the established view that Shakespeare wrote nothing until his middle twenties, nor revised his own work."
"Australia, New Zealand, And The Pacific Islands Since The First World War",['William S. Livingston'],"In this volume, some of the most distinguished scholars of the Pacific region assess significant historical changes in Australia, New Zealand, and the adjacent islands from 1919 to 1970."
Building A Palestinian State: The Incomplete Revolution (indiana Series In Arab And Islamic Studies),['Glenn E Robinson'],"In this well-informed and accessibly written book, Glenn E. Robinson traces the emergence of a new political elite in the West Bank and Gaza in the 1980s and the grassroots political and social revolution that it launched during the Intifada. Local self-help organizations forged in this period - student groups, labor unions, women's committees, agricultural and medical-relief associations, and other voluntary works organizations - took power away from traditional landowners and began building popular institutions which organized Palestinian society and which Israel found impossible to eliminate. After the Intifada, however, power in the polity was captured by an outside political force: Yasir Arafat and the PLO. Robinson focuses on the resulting disjunction between the grassroots popular authority of the new institutions, the centralizing, authoritarian tendencies of the PLO, and the diminishing prospects for building a stable Palestinian state."
Oedipus At Thebes: Sophocles' Tragic Hero And His Time,['Bernard Knox'],"In this widely praised book, an eminent classicist examines Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus in the context of fifth-century B.C. Athens. In attempting to discover what the play meant to Sophocles' contemporaries-and in particular in disentangling Sophocles' ideas from Freud's psychoanalytical interpretations-Bernard Knox casts fresh light on its timeless and universal nature. For this edition, Knox has provided a new preface and a list of suggested readings.<br>
""What a joy it is to welcome this book back in print. As perennial as Sophocles' great play itself, Knox's work has never gone out of date, and never will.""-Robert Fagles Reviews of the earlier editions:<br>
""A superb analysis, demonstrating that when classical study is aware of Freud and the techniques of modern literary criticism, it can be as exciting nowadays as it must have been during the Renaissance.""-New Yorker<br>
""A superb critical and textual investigation.""-New York Times<br>
""One of the major contributions to Sophoclean and to Greek studies in recent years.""-Virginia Quarterly Review<br>
""A magnificent contribution ... which is really required reading.""-Cedric Whitman, American Journal of Philology<br>
""A brilliant piece of work combining the best of classical scholarship with the best of modern literary criticism.""-John E. Rexine, Hellenic World"
Seeing Like A State: How Certain Schemes To Improve The Human Condition Have Failed,['James C. Scott'],"In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. He argues that centrally managed social plans derail when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not -- and cannot be -- fully understood. Further the success of designs for social organization depends on the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against ""development theory"" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans."
Toward Commitment: A Dialogue About Marriage,"['Rehm, Diane.']","In Toward Commitment, Diane Rehm, the nationally known Public Radio broadcaster, and John, her lawyer-husband, open up for the reader their marriage of over forty years, revealing their passionate bond as well as their points of conflict and frustration. In a series of surprisingly honest dialogues, they grapple with their pronounced differences of background, attitude, and expectation. Addressing difficult and important issues-from love and sex and raising children to dependence and independence, from spiritual differences to financial and social needs-Toward Commitment gives readers the opportunity to eavesdrop on a husband and wife bravely analyzing their relationship and confronting the issues that inevitably strain a relationship. Refreshingly candid, these perceptive discussions will resonate with any two people who care enough about each other to resolve their difficulties. A practical guide for married couples as well as a must-read for couples considering that commitment, this thoughtful and ultimately hopeful book will help them become closer than ever."
How Free Can Religion Be?,['Randall P. Bezanson'],"In tracking the evolution of the First Amendment's Free Exercise and Establishment Clause doctrine through Key Supreme Court decisions on religious freedom, legal scholar Randall P. Bezanson focuses on the court's shift from strict separation of church and state to a position where the government accommodates and even fosters religion. Beginning with samples from the latter half of the nineteenth century, the detailed case studies present new problems and revisit old ones as well: the purported belief of polygamy in the Mormon Church; state support for religious schools; the teaching of evolution and creationism in public schools; Amish claims for exemption from compulsory education laws; comparable claims for Native American religion in relation to drug laws; and rights of free speech and equal access by religious groups in colleges and public schools."
Twenty Questions,['J. D. McClatchy'],"In Twenty Questions, one of America's finest poet-critics leads readers into the mysteries of poetry: how it draws on our lives, and how it leads us back into them. In a series of linked essays progressing from the autobiographical to the critical - and closing with a remarkable translation of Horace's Ars Poetica unavailable elsewhere - J. D. McClatchy's latest book offers an intimate and illuminating look into the poetic mind. McClatchy begins with a portrait of his development as a poet, and provides vibrant details about some of those who helped shape his sensibility - from Anne Sexton in her final days, to Harold Bloom, his enigmatic teacher at Yale, to James Merrill, a wise and witty mentor. All of these glimpses into McClatchy's personal history enhance our understanding of a coming of age from ingenuous reader to accomplished poet-critic. Later sections range through poetry past and present - from Emily Dickinson to Seamus Heaney and W. S. Merwin - with incisive criticism generously interspersed with vivid anecdotes about McClatchy's encounters with other poets' lives and work. A critical unpacking of Alexander Pope's Epistle to Miss Blount, for instance, is interwoven with a compassionate psychological portrait of a brilliant poet plagued by both romantic longings and debilitating physical deformities. There are surprising takes on the literary imagination as well: a look at Elizabeth Bishop through her letters, and a tribute to the Broadway lyrics of Stephen Sondheim."
The Spirit Of The Place: Indiana Hill Country,"['Jones, Darryl , 1948-']","In Walden Pond Henry Thoreau found a setting which inspired his famous musings on the nature of existence and the foibles of his society. Photographer Jones and writer Thom take similar inspiration from the hill country in Southern Indiana where they live and work and in consort provide a beautiful and insightful meditation on the meaning of place, the values of rootedness and community, and their different but similar paths toward personal harmony and spiritual understanding. Jones sees beyond the surface of nature to the basic elements - earth, air, water, and rock. His photographs are ""contemplative studies on the metaphysics of nature, the invisible made visible, God's mind revealed,"" the pre-existing harmony which exists in nature if only we can see it. Thom's text, taking its inspiration from Jones's images, traces the cycle of his life from birth in rural Gosport, to journalism in the big cities of the world, and then back home again, where he found both his voice as a writer and his spiritual rootedness.

"Windows and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital Art, and the Myth of Transparency","['Jay David Bolter', 'Diane Gromala']","In Windows and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital Art, and the Myth of Transparency, Jay David Bolter and Diane Gromala argues that, contrary to Donald Norman's famous dictum, we do not always want our computers to be invisible information appliances. They say that a computer does not feel like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner, it feels like a medium that is now taking its place beside other media like printing, film, radio, and television. The computer as medium creates new forms and genres for artists and designers, Bolter and Gromala want to show what digital art has to offer to Web designers, education technologists, graphic artists, interface designers, HCI experts, and, for that matter, anyone interested in the cultural implications of the digital revolution."
Life Histories Of North American Woodpeckers,['Arthur Cleveland Bent'],"Indiana is proud to publish this lavish book, the first properly designed and professionally illustrated edition of any of Arthur Cleveland Bent's Life Histories of North American Birds. For the first time in this century, one of Bent's books is now available in an appropriate format, handsome library bindings, a modern attractive typeface, and with magnificent original paintings. Eventually, Zimmerman and the Press expect to republish the entire series in this new format. Everyone who develops a serious interest in birds soon discovers Bent's Life Histories. He began work on the project in 1910 at the request of the Smithsonian Institution and continued gathering and publishing material until his death in 1954. The Histories provide the most comprehensive and interesting collection of field observations of North American birds ever made. Anyone observing a particular bird for the first time, at the backyard bird feeder or in the field, quickly wants more information than the standard field guides provide. Bent never disappoints. His books are a naturalist's delight. No ornithologist or nature lover of any stripe, professional or amateur, should be without these books. All of the woodpeckers seen in North America are covered in this volume. In enthusiastic, readable prose, Bent and his collaborators give us information about courtship, nesting habits, eggs, young, plumage, range, behavior, voice, enemies, distribution, migratory habits, and much, much more. Added to this handsome republication are the original paintings of one of America's finest bird painters. Zimmerman says:. ""In rereading Bent's Life Histories of North American Woodpeckers in preparation for illustrating this book, I became newly inspired by the vivid descriptions of how the Harris's Woodpecker takes cover during downpours in the rain forest of western Washington; the White-headed Woodpecker in California's pine-forested highlands coming down to drink from a mountain stream; the male and fem"
Shadows Of Treblinka,"['Miriam Kuperhand', 'Saul Kuperhand']","Inspiring and compelling, this husband-and-wife memoir traces two very different paths through uncertainty and horror ... to survival. Saul was the son of a poor shoemaker, Miriam the daughter of a prosperous furrier. Both grew up in Siemiatcyze, a small town near what became, in 1939, the Russian-German border - only forty miles away from the Treblinka death camp. Both waged courageous and daring fights for life that stand as rare counterexamples to the widely held belief that Jews offered minimal resistance to their persecutors. At the same time their stories provide startling evidence of the prior knowledge Jews in the region surrounding Treblinka had of the genocide taking place there. Saul's riveting ""Escape from Treblinka"" is one of the few accounts ever published of escape from this camp. On the run and forced to seek help from strangers, he was constantly in danger of being discovered or betrayed. In ""Long Days, Dark Nights,"" Miriam recounts her own harrowing tale: first hiding in an underground bunker and then, with her brother, searching the wild Polish countryside for their parents. Shadows of Treblinka draws the reader deep into the daily terrors and struggles of eluding capture and death at the hands of the Nazis. Ultimately, these separate tales of courage, faith, resourcefulness, and luck come together in a remarkable love story."
Here I Stand,['Norris Kelly Smith'],"Interpretations in Art is a series dedicated to the history, theory and criticism of art. Its aim is to make available interpretive essays that offer new insight into the complexities of art and the critical methods for understanding them.

"German Atrocities, 1914: A History Of Denial","['Associate Prof. John Horne', 'Dr. Alan Kramer', 'Alan Kramer']","Is it true that the German army, invading Belgium and France in August 1914, perpetrated brutal atrocities? Or are accounts of the deaths of thousands of unarmed civilians mere fabrications constructed by fanatically anti-German Allied propagandists? Based on research in the archives of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, this pathbreaking book uncovers the truth of the events of autumn 1914 and explains how the politics of propaganda and memory have shaped radically different versions of that truth.
<p>John Horne and Alan Kramer mine military reports, official and private records, witness evidence, and war diaries to document the crimes that have long been denied: a campaign of brutality that led to the death of some 6500 Belgian and French civilians. Contemporary German accounts insisted that the civilians were guerrillas, executed for illegal resistance. In reality this claim originated in a vast collective delusion on the part of German soldiers. The authors establish how this myth originated and operated, and how opposed Allied and German views of events were used in the propaganda war. They trace the memory and forgetting of the atrocities on both sides up to and beyond World War II.</p>
<p>Meticulously researched and convincingly argued, this book re-opens a painful chapter in European history while contributing to broader debates about myth, propaganda, memory, war crimes, and the nature of the First World War.</p>

"Private Antitrust Litigation: New Evidence, New Learning",['Lawrence J. White'],"Is private antitrust litigation out of control, encouraging frivolous suits and deterring companies from pursuing innovative manufacturing, organization, and distributional techniques? Or is it a fair and useful system, particularly during periods when government antitrust enforcement is lax and pro-business? The contributions in this book shed new light on the current debate over treble damage reform.<p>Using a unique collection of data on more than 2,350 antitrust cases filed in five districts between 1973 and 1983 - a research effort instigated by the Georgetown private treble damage project - prominent scholars analyze the key issues involved in reform proposals.  Steven Salop and Lawrence White present an analytic framework for studying private antitrust litigation, setting out the policy issues and providing an overview of the data collected by the project. Paul Teplitz discusses the nature of the data and their collection in greater detail.</p><p>Kenneth Elzinga and William Wood compare the cost of litigation to the size of settlements and awards in an attempt to gauge the degree to which the system compensates victims of antitrust violations as opposed to the system's effectiveness as a deterrent. Jeffrey Perloff and Daniel Rubinfeld focus on the incentives for litigants to settle, and Stephen Calkins notes the reaction of the legal system to treble damages in the light of motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment. Thomas Kauper and Edward Snyder look at those cases that followed on government cases (primarily price fixing), and George Benston takes up multi-party cases, considering the effects of class actions, joint and several liability, and various claim reduction reform proposals on deterrence and the incentives to settle.</p><p>The book's final section presents three interesting and diverse policy commentaries by George Garvey, Ira Millstein, and Donald Turner.</p><p>Lawrence J.

The Vindication Of The Big Bang: Breakthroughs And Barriers (artech House Materials Science),['Barry R. Parker'],"Is the Big Bang Theory more viable today than it was at its inception 70 years ago? The prolific and ever-curious author, Barry Parker, confronts the most controversial and significant debate of modern cosmology. Big Bang bashing has been indulged in since the birth of this magnificent theory. But is it justified? In an impartial and balanced presentation, Parker introduces the distinctive personalities responsible for the breakthroughs and advances in this burgeoning field."
Conversations With Isabel Allende,"['Allende, Isabel']","Isabel Allende is arguably the world's most popular living woman writer. Her major books-The House of the Spirits, Of Love and Shadows, Eva Luna, The Stories of Eva Luna, The Infinite Plan, and Paula-have been translated into nearly thirty languages and have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. The first two novels have been made into successful Hollywood films.
<p>A marvelous ability for storytelling, particularly the hidden stories of women's lives, is the secret of Allende's success. In this collection of thirty-four interviews spanning the 1980s and 1990s, she tells her own story in her own words, from her early years as a Chilean TV personality and niece of the late Chilean president Salvador Allende through the major transformations of her adult life, first as a political refugee in Venezuela, then as a United States visitor, permanent California resident, newly remarried wife, and renowned world writer.</p>
<p>The interviews spotlight issues in Allende's life, art, and working habits that have consistently fascinated her readers and critics. Five of the interviews have not been published before, and several that originally appeared in Spanish, German, and Dutch are here translated into English for the first time. As a collection, the interviews constitute a sharply focused, intimate short autobiography of Isabel Allende-the first to appear in any language. Family photographs selected by Allende (including some never before published) complement the text.</p>"
Israelis And Palestinians: Why Do They Fight? Can They Stop?,['Bernard Wasserstein'],"Israelis and Palestinians offers a startlingly new interpretation of the historical and contemporary realities of the conflict in the Middle East. Bernard Wasserstein challenges the conventional view of the struggle as driven primarily by irrational ethnic and religious hatreds. Instead he focuses on largely neglected forces -- including population, fertility rates, labor, and environmental pressures -- that have shaped politics in the region over the past century and which will inevitably determine its future. Wasserstein argues that Israelis and Palestinians live today in Siamese twin societies; however much they may wish to, neither side can escape the impinging presence and influence of the other. Demographic, economic, and social imperatives are driving Israelis and Palestinians toward mutual accommodation. At a time of diplomatic impasse and escalating bloodshed, Wasserstein offers a realistic and persuasive basis for optimism."
Most Humble Servants: The Advisory Role Of Early Judges,"['Jay, Stewart.']","It has long been assumed that throughout the history of the United States, the role of judges was limited to adjudicating cases and did not include performing other official functions for the executive and legislative branches of government. This book challenges that assumption, investigating the variety of duties judges performed until the end of the eighteenth century and exploring why a new separation of powers developed only after 1793. Stewart Jay shows that early judges in both the United States and Great Britain provided extrajudicial advisory opinions to the executive, took administrative assignments, assisted in legislative drafting, and even held offices in other branches of government. In 1793, however, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to answer the Washington administration's request for legal advice on American treaty relations with France. Jay argues that if we take into consideration late eighteenth-century theories of separation of powers and the probable intent of the Framers of the Constitution, no significant constitutional barriers prevented the Court from answering Washington's questions. The actual reasons for the Court's refusal were related to the practical consequences that would result if the Justices issued a formal advisory opinion during a foreign policy crisis. Similarly, says Jay, British judges of the same period also abandoned advisory opinions owing to pragmatic concerns. Jay thus offers a revisionary account of the 1793 political-legal crisis, a landmark event in the formation of the American judiciary and the doctrine of separation of powers."
Indiana From The Air,"['Fields, Richard.']","It is not often that a publisher or an author or an artist has the opportunity to do something no one else has done before, something that is wholly new and original. Indiana from the Air is such a project. Never before has there been a systematic effort to photograph Indiana from above ground level from north to south and east to west. From the Ohio River to Lake Michigan and from the Wabash to Richmond, Fields and Huffman have captured the full variety of the Hoosier state, including natural areas, cityscapes, farm scenes, towns, factories, unique landforms, waterways, industry, the impact of the seasons, the art of a plowed field or a parking lot, an eagle's eye view of an eagle, the immensity of the land and also its fragility, the meander at New Harmony, the countryside as 'dream ... and much more. Ninety-seven magnificent full-color illustrations provide a new visual perspective of Indiana. Anyone with the slightest curiosity about this place called Indiana will want to own and study this lavish volume. All of the images have been selected for their artistic quality as well as their content, and many of them go beyond mere representation to a philosophical and even spiritual dimension. See Indiana from the air and see it anew."
"How The News Media Fail American Voters: Causes, Consequences, And Remedies","['Dautrich, Kenneth.']","It is often noted that the public is frustrated with the news media. But what do American voters really think about how the media present political information? While studies have examined how the news shapes opinions as well as what people respond to and remember, this is the first book to provide an in-depth analysis of how voters use and evaluate the news media in political elections and the impact these trends have on their use of the news. Kenneth Dautrich and Thomas H. Hartley performed a four-wave national panel survey of voters during the 1996 presidential campaign and found that although voters are profoundly dissatisfied with the media's ability to help them with electoral decisions, they are unlikely to switch their source of information--thus giving the media no incentive to change. How the News Media Fail American Voters is an important contribution to the debate about the responsibilities of the news media raging among pundits and policymakers."
Presidential Impeachment,['John R. Labovitz'],"It is presumptuous, I suppose, to write a book whose primary audience one hopes will not be around for a long time to come. The author hopes, therefore, that this book will be of more interest to those who would like to know more about the constitutional procedure that the House of Representatives invoked in 1974."
Bat Bomb: World War Ii's Other Secret Weapon,['Jack Couffer'],"It was a crazy way to win World War II in the Pacific -S. All the United States had to do was to attach small incendiary bombs to millions of bats and release them over Japan's major cities. As the bats went to roost, a million fires would flare up in remote crannies of the wood and paper buildings common throughout Japan. When their cities were reduced to ashes, the Japanese would surely capitulate ... The plan made sense to a handful of eccentric promoters and researchers, who convinced top military brass and even President Roosevelt to back the scheme. It might have worked, except that another secret weapon - something to do with atoms - was chosen to end the war. Told here by the youngest member of the team, this is the story of the bat bomb project, or Project X-Ray, as it was officially known. In scenes worthy of a Capra or Hawks comedy, Jack Couffer recounts the unorthodox experiments carried out in the secrecy of Bandera, Texas, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and El Centro, California, in 1942-1943 by ""Doc"" Adams' private army. This oddball cast of characters included an eccentric inventor, a distinguished Harvard scientist, a biologist with a chip on his shoulder, a movie star, a Texas guano collector, a crusty Marine Corps colonel, a Maine lobster fisherman, an ex-mobster, and a tiger. Not to be defeated by minor logistical hurdles, the bat bomb researchers risked life and limb to explore uncharted bat caves and ""recruit"" thousands of bats to serve their country. Through months of personality conflicts, military snafus, and technical failures the team pressed on, certain that bats could end the war with Japan. And they might have - in their first airborne test, the bat bombers burned an entire brand-new military airfield to the ground. For everyone who relishes true tales of action and adventure, Bat Bomb is a must-read. Bat enthusiasts will also discover the beginnings of the scientific study of bats."
Zoning And Property Rights,['Robert H. Nelson'],"It's a deeply rooted American idea that an individual should be able to join with other persons of similar means and values to establish and maintain a preferred environment. Although not often recognized as such, zoning has major implications for the quality of physical environments, the distribution of income, transportation, housing, local taxation, and racial and class segregation. Zoning thus raises important issues concerning social inequalities and personal property rights.
<p>Robert Nelson contends that in effect zoning has created collective property rights, which are now held by local government. His book analyzes the development of zoning, its aims, fictions surrounding it, and its successes and failures. It examines recent environment land-use regulations, their probable outcomes, and future prospects of the regulatory system. Only by bringing together the disparate elements—the socioeconomic consequences of the changes zoning has wrought on property rights; zoning history, the role of planning; political pressures on zoning administration and law—can one understand the full complexities of the zoning problem.</p>
<p>The author maintains that recent environmental restrictions on land use have led to an undesirable feudal trend. In detail he outlines suggestions for ""major surgery."" He recommends that private tenure institutions resembling condominium ownership be developed to replace neighborhood zoning. Community zoning should be abolished, and decision-making should be returned to the private sector. Formal public planning organizations and government as a whole should play only a minimal role in determining specific uses of land.</p>
<p>For all professionals in the field—urban economists, political scientists, planners, zoning lawyers, students of urban and environmental affairs—and even general readers who have a particular interest in the topic, Nelson's critique, with its bold advocacy of reconstruction, will provide a valuable stimulus for discussion.</p>"

Six Days In Havana,"['James A. Michener', 'John Kings']","James A. Michener, one of the most celebrated writers of our time, has an extraordinary talent for finding the essence of a place. His books give readers an unmistakable ""you are there"" feeling, whether set in the South Seas, Alaska, Afghanistan, or Poland. Six Days in Havana has the same immediacy, providing glimpses of a city that has been terra incognita to most North Americans for thirty years. With his associate, John Kings, Michener visited Havana during research for a new novel on the Caribbean. He was only looking for a house and a sugar plantation in which to set the Cuban portion of his story, but he found much more to excite his interest. Fascinated initially by the spectacle of once-grand public buildings and ornate mansions slowing falling into ruin, Michener and Kings set out to explore all of Havana that they could see in six days.
<p> James Michener's insightful text and John Kings' evocative photographs record their impressions of Havana thirty years after the Revolution. The words and pictures beautifully complement each other, offering views of a city that many North Americans may never otherwise see. Michener and Kings visited residential districts, the downtown business and government zone, the old city, churches, museums, a distillery, coffee and sugar plantations in the outlying areas, La Vigia, the former home of Ernest Hemingway, and the fishing village Cojima, the setting for Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea.

"The Selected Papers Of Boulton And Watt, Vol. 1: The Engine Partnership, 1775-1825","['Boulton, Matthew , 1728-1809']","James Watt was granted his first patent on a steam engine in 1769, but he ran into financial difficulties in trying to exploit it. Fortunately, he was to find a solid businessman—Matthew Boulton—to handle the finances and marketing. In 1775, the firm of Boulton &amp; Watt was established and obtained a twenty-five-year extension of Watt's patent. Watt's inventive genius and Boulton's keen eye for new markets and applications was a successful combination, and their engines were a prime power source for the first Industrial Revolution.
<p>The company's papers, and the personal papers of the founders, are preserved in Birmingham, England, and are a unique source of information and insight regarding the emergence of the modern technological era. The most significant and revealing of these papers will be systematically edited and published in a series of volumes, of which this is the first. Some eight years of research have already been invested in this mammoth project, and the rewards should be substantial for historians, whether their interests center on science and technology, business and industrial development, or social and economic change.</p>
<p>The 213 documents in volume 1 trace the emergence of the partnership, describe the state of engine technology, cover the firm's patents and privileges at home and abroad and its difficulties with pirates, spies, and competitors, and reflect the development of the engine business: separate sections deal with subcontracting practices, customer complaints, profits and premiums, engineers and mechanics, the Soho foundry and engine manufactory, and engine sales (and after-sales service) in both the domestic and overseas markets.</p>"

"Last Cavalier: The Life And Times Of John A. Lomax, 1867-1948","['Porterfield, Nolan.']","John A. Lomax was an American original, a man of intellect, tireless ambition, visionary zeal, and vast contradictions. Perhaps best known as a pioneer American folklorist, he was also a successful businessman, an influential educator, and the patriarch of an extended family of artists, performers, and scholars whose work continues to influence American culture on both popular and academic levels. Last Cavalier is the never-before-told story of Lomax's long career, as colorful and lively as it was controversial. The book chronicles how this native Mississippian (although Lomax emphatically considered himself a Texan, having come to that state with his family as a child) collected folksongs on horseback, sold stocks and bonds, served at several major universities, lectured nationwide on many occasions, published a dozen books, helped legitimize comparative literature as an academic discipline, and played a major role in developing the Library of Congress's Archive of American Folk Song, now part of the American Folklife Center. This first full account of Lomax's life relies on eight years of research through the Lomax family letters and papers and many interviews with those who knew him."

Jonathan Sewall; Odyssey Of An American Loyalist,"['Berkin, Carol.']","Jonathan Sewall, an aristocratic Boston Loyalist, was born into a bankrupt branch of a prominent Massachusetts family in 1728. He developed a friendship with John Adams that survived the Revolutionary War personally but not politically.Sewall sought to avoid confrontation with his revolutionary friends while remaining independent in his appointed post as a publicist to the King of England, but was trapped in the political hierarchy of colonial Massachusetts. Unnerved by the Boston Massacre, Sewall retired to the country to avoid prosecuting the British soldiers. When the Revolution began in earnest Sewall took refuge in England, confident that a quick British victory would return him to Massachusetts.

His Album de zoologia, of which this is the English version, gives voice to myriad creatures who inhabit land, sea, air, and even (mythically) fire.

Contested Meanings: The Construction Of Alcohol Problems,"['Gusfield, Joseph R. , 1923-']","Joseph R. Gusfield has been for decades the most creative, penetrating, and far-sighted sociologist of alcohol's ambiguous place in American society. Combining in his work the perspectives and methods of historian, anthropologist, and sociologist, Gusfield brings together in this volume many of his most important articles from a span of twenty years, as well as several fascinating but little-known ethnographic studies of bars in San Diego and a previously unpublished study of court-mandated procedures involving convicted drinking-drivers. Gusfield begins by offering two new constructionist analyses of social problems, focusing on alcohol. His theme throughout Contested Meanings is the conflicting and changing ways society defines social problems (when does alcohol consumption cross the line from social activity to social problem?) and on the social and policy consequences of those definitions. He emerges in the course of the book as a thoughtful and realistic social critic who looks beyond analyses of drinking as pathological behavior to consider the place of alcohol in American popular and leisure culture."

Karen Horney: A Psychoanalyst's Search For Self-understanding,"['Paris, Bernard J.']","Karen Horney (1885-1952) is regarded by many as one of the most important psychoanalytic thinkers of the twentieth century. Her early work, in which she quarreled with Freud's views on female psychology, established her as the first great psychoanalytic feminist. In her later years, she developed a sophisticated theory of her own which provided powerful explanations of human behavior that have proved to be widely applicable. Yet through these years of intellectual achievement, Horney struggled with emotional problems. This engrossing study of Horney's life and work draws on newly discovered materials to explore the relation between her personal history and the evolution of her ideas. Bernard J. Paris argues that Horney's inner struggles - in particular her compulsive need for men - induced her to embark on a search for self-understanding, which she recorded first in her diaries and then in her covertly autobiographical psychoanalytic writings. Although this search brought Horney only partial relief from her problems, it led her to profound and original insights into the human psyche. Paris describes Horney's life - her childhood and adolescence in Germany, marriage to Oskar Horney, motherhood, analysis and self analysis, immigration to the United States, founding of the American Institute for Psychoanalysis, ostracism by the psychoanalytic establishment, and many romantic liaisons. At the same time he examines the various stages of Horney's thought, showing how her experiences influenced her ideas. Focusing particularly on Horney's later work, Paris shows her mature theory to be an important contribution to the study of literature, biography, gender, and culture, as well as to psychoanalysis and psychology."

King: The Bullitts Of Seattle And Their Communications Empire,['O. Casey Corr'],"King tells the dramatic story of how Dorothy Bullitt built a great company and used it to influence the largest city of the Pacific Northwest. Far from the media capital of New York City, Bullitt and the employees of her King Broadcasting Company were free to invent local television and use its command of a vast audience to define and shape public issues during Seattle's staggering growth and transformation after World War II. Starting in 1951 with a clumsy 15-minute news program, KING-TV soon added passionately committed journalists and gave them extraordinary freedom. KING's journalists attacked Seattle's powerful politicians, prodded its inept public agencies, and chided its provincial attitudes, winning a host of national awards in the process. Their activist agenda and confident, aggressive style created controversy, both within the community and within the company. In this independent account, author Casey Corr traces the origins and growth of the company's public spirit and follows KING's coverage of many fascinating stories of postwar Seattle, including McCarthyism in Seattle politics; Bullitt family friendships with Senators Henry Jackson and Warren Magnuson; the rise and fall of Republican Party leader Charles O. Carroll; the assassination of civil rights leader Edwin Pratt; the mayoral campaign of KING commentator Charles Royer; and the secret struggle within the Seattle news media to expose a corrupt judge."
Laud Humphreys: Prophet Of Homosexuality And Sociology,"['John F. Galliher', 'Wayne Brekhus', 'David P.

In graduate school during the late 1960s, he conducted extensive fieldwork in public restrooms in a St. Louis city park to discover patterns of impersonal sex among men. He published the results in <i>Tearoom Trade</i>. Three decades later the book still triggers many debates about the ethics of his research methods. In 1974, he was the first sociologist to come out as gay. <i>Laud Humphreys: Prophet of Homosexuality and Sociology</i> examines the groundbreaking work through the life of a complex man and the life of the man through his controversial work. It is an invaluable contribution to sociology and a fascinating record of a courageous life."
Preempting The Holocaust,['Lawrence L. Langer'],"Lawrence L. Langer, perhaps the most important literary critic of the Holocaust, here explores the use of Holocaust themes in literature, memoirs, film, and painting. Among the authors he examines are Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Cynthia Ozick, Art Spiegelman, and Simon Wiesenthal. He appraises the art of Samuel Bak, considered by many the premier Holocaust painter of our time, and assesses the ""Holocaust Project"" by Judy Chicago. He also offers a critical interpretation of Undzere Kinder, a neglected but important Yiddish film made in Poland after the war about Holocaust orphans. 
<p>Langer focuses his attention on a variety of controversial issues: the attempt of a number of commentators to appropriate the subject of the Holocaust for private moral agendas; the ordeal of women in the concentration camps; the conflicting claims of individual and community survival in the Kovno ghetto; the current tendency to conflate the Holocaust with other modern atrocities, thereby blurring the distinctive features of each; and the sporadic impulse to shift the emphasis from the crime, the criminals, and the victimized to the question of forgiveness and the need for healing. He concludes with some reflections on the challenge of teaching the Holocaust to generations of students who know less and less of its history but continue to manifest an eager curiosity about its human impact and psychological roots.</p>"

"Crazy Rhythm: From Brooklyn And Jazz To Nixon's White House, Watergate, And Beyond","['Garment', 'Leonard']","Leonard Garment was a successful Wall Street attorney when, in 1965, he found himself arguing a Supreme Court case alongside his new law partner—former Vice President Richard Nixon. It was the start of a friendship that lasted more than thirty years. In <i>Crazy Rhythm,</i> which the <i>New York Times</i> Book Review called ""an eloquent memoir,"" Garment engagingly tells of his boyhood as the child of immigrants, and the beginning of a life-long love affair with jazz. After Brooklyn Law School, Garment went on to Wall Street, where encountering Nixon changed the course of his life. <i>Crazy Rhythm</i> allows us a rare, intimate look at Nixon's extraordinary tenure in the White House.

All Shook Up: A Flash Of The Fifties,['Joseph Connolly'],"Life would never be the same again! When the war ended and prosperity began, a cultural revolution broke out: rock 'n roll was here to stay and restless youth exploded with newfound energy. From impudent teddy boys, screaming teenyboppers, and swooning bobby-soxers to a hip-swiveling Elvis, sexy Marilyn, brooding James Dean, and the swinging Buddy Holly, the 1950s gave birth to a fresh style in the home, the streets, and the entertainment world, too. Celebrate this unparalleled decade through evocative, extraordinary photographs (many formerly unseen) and witty, incisive text written by an acclaimed novelist and journalist. Coming alive on the pages are the most popular TV shows of the period; dancers letting the good times roll; a child's-eye view of the rapidly modernizing society; the fads and fashions, beatniks and bohemians, celebrities and cinematic successes, and gizmos, gadgets, signs, and ads that defined the age. You'll understand why these were the years when a whole lot of shakin' was going on! 7 1/2 X 9 3/4."
The House On The Beach: A Novel (texas Pan American Series),['Juan García Ponce'],"Like waves ebbing and flowing, love surges and subsides among four friends who share a vacation at the house on the beach. As they navigate the seas of love friendship, jealously and unfaithfulness, Elena, Marta, Eduardo, and Rafael are swept up in the opposing currents that flow between security and personal freedom, marriage and sexual liberation, family and work, provincial and city life, and traditional and unconventional gender roles. This deceptively simple novel, published in Mexico in 1966 as La casa en la playa and here translated into English for the first time, is an important work by one of Mexico's, and indeed Latin America's, major writers of the twentieth century. Juan Garcia Ponce helped Mexican arts and letters break out of the ossified styles and themes of the post-Revolutionary ""Mexican School"" with works that explore the conflict between individual desire and the demands of family and work. Written at a turning point in his career, The House on the Beach foreshadows his embrace of the erotic encounter as a means of undermining rigid, socially constructed personal identity. It supports feminist views and probes deeply into the contradictions, backwardness, and progress of modern Mexican society."
Honorable Exiles: A Chilean Woman In The Twentieth Century,['Lillian Lorca De Tagle'],"Lillian Lorca de Tagle is living proof of women's progress in the twentieth century. Born into a privileged, yet circumscribed world in 1914 as the daughter of a wealthy Chilean diplomat, she became a translator and journalist at a time when few women of her class held jobs. Ordered into exile in the United States by her disapproving mother, she became a successful reporter, translator, and editor, while raising two daughters as a single working mother."" ""In this memoir, de Tagle looks back over a fascinating, cosmopolitan life. She describes how her upbringing in various European capitals prepared her for a life of continual change. She remembers the restrictions that upper class Chilean society placed on women and how these ultimately propelled her to a career in the United States that included an editorship at Americas magazine and work for the State Department, as well as a series of posts with the USIA/Voice of America."" ""Woven throughout her memoir are vivid glimpses of family, friends, husbands, and lovers, including the artist Roberto Matta."
The Portable Kristeva,"['Kristeva, Julia , 1941-']","Linguist, psychoanalyst, and cultural theorist, Julia Kristeva is one of the most influential and prolific thinkers of our time. Acclaimed for her contributions over the past three decades in many areas of the humanities, her works have broken new ground in the study of the self, the mind, and the ways in which we communicate through language. The Portable Kristeva is the first up-to-date, fully representative selection of Kristeva's most important writings of the last two decades. Here are Kristeva's insights on depression and melancholy from Black Sun, on the highly influential study of abjection from Powers of Horror, and on the nation and territorial space at a time when foreigners can no longer be understood as an aberration, and the impact that has on both our national and our psychic identities in Strangers to Ourselves. Excerpts from New Maladies of the Soul consider psychoanalysis and its tropes in light of the dramatic overhaul of familial and sexual mores at the end of the millennium. Passages from the recent Time and Sense show that book to be much more than an illuminating meditation on Proust's work; it is also a commentary on how the experience of literature is manifested in time and sensation, feeling and language. The essays not only reflect Kristeva's most salient contributions to philosophy, literary and cultural theory, linguistics, psychoanalytic theory, and feminist theory but also testify to her erudition and prominence in those fields. Enriched by a lucid introduction that provides an overview of Kristeva's contributions to the intellectual life of our time, The Portable Kristeva will serve as an essential tool for those familiar with her oeuvre, and will provide a succinct and complete introduction for those new to her writings."
The Death Of Literature,['Alvin Kernan'],"Literature has passed through a crisis of confidence in recent decades-a radical questioning of its traditional values and its importance to humanity. In this witty and eloquent book, a distinguished professor of humanities looks at some of the agents that have contributed to literature's demise and ponders whether its vitality can be restored in the changing circumstances of late twentieth-century culture. 
<p>Other critics, such as E. D. Hirsch and Allan Bloom, have also explored the growing cultural illiteracy of modern society. Alvin Kernan probes deeper, relating the death of literature to potent forces in our postindustrial world-most obviously, the technological revolution that is rapidly transforming a print to an electronic culture, replacing the authority of the written word with the authority of television, film, and computer screens. The turn taken by literary criticism itself, in deconstructing traditional literature and declaring it void of meaning in itself, and in focusing on what are described as its ideological biases against women and nonwhites, has speeded the disintegration. Recent legal debates about copyright, plagiarism, and political patronage of the arts have exposed the greed and self-interest at work under the old romantic images of the imaginative creative artist and the work of art as a perfect, unchanging icon.</p>
<p>Kernan describes a number of the crossroads where literature and society have met and literature has failed to stand up. He discusses the high comedy of the obscenity trial in England against Lady Chatterley's Lover, in which the British literary establishment vainly tried to define literature. He takes alarmed looks at such agents of literary disintegration as schools where children who watch television eight hours a day can't read, decisions about who chooses and defines the words included in dictionaries, faculty fights about the establishment of new departments and categories of study, and courtrooms where criminals try to profit from bestselling books about their crimes.</p>
<p>According to Kernan, traditional literature is ceasing to be legitimate or useful in these changed social surroundings. What is needed, he says, if it is any longer possible in electronic culture, is a conception of literature that fits in some positive way with the new ethos of post-industrialism, plausibly claiming a place of importance both to individual lives and to society as a whole for the best kind of writing.</p>


                        <p>A distinguished writer and scholar explores literature's ""crisis of confidence."" Writing in anecdotal and witty style, Kernan relates the death of literature to a variety of agents and ponders whether literature's vitality can be restored in the changing circumstances of late 20th-century culture.

Control In The Police Organization (organization Studies),['Punch'],"Looking behind the facade of tightly structured tables of organization and chains of command, this group of studies addresses the key question of how the police go about policing themselves in the real world. The contributors' point of departure is the documented evidence that the men and women on the streets enjoy considerable autonomy and discretion that make strict accountability and close supervision the exception and mutual back-scratching in the lower ranks the rule, where the code of silence and the falsified report cover up widespread work avoidance, short-cut methods, illicit violence, and pay-offs.
<p>In spite of this, there are clearly constraints on police behavior-institutional controls, formal or informal, that keep the police under rein to a greater or lesser extent. The book probes the various sources of organizational control, including formal internal disciplinary regulations, the norms and values of the occupational culture, external legal constraints, and the overriding need to prevent scandals. It also suggests ways of improving organizational control through managerial reforms that bring to key positions not just proficient bureaucrats but leaders at all levels within the force who possess insight and empathy into the inescapable dilemmas of the men and women on the line where the real police decisions are made.</p>
<p>The book is interdisciplinary and international in its scope, representing the research and informed views of sociologists, students of management and public policy, and police from the United States, Great Britain, Belgium, and The Netherlands.</p>

Birth Or Abortion?: Private Struggles In A Political World,"['Kate Maloy', 'Margaret Jones Patterson']","Many Americans who believe that women should be able to choose when and whether to bear a child are also deeply disturbed by the one-and-one-half million abortions performed each year in this country. They regard these concerns as irreconcilable, because the topic of abortion, until now, has been framed as a black-or-white conflict between the rights of the mother and those of the fetus. The very idea of compromise or common cause draws scorn among factions. How, after all, can the political debate about abortion permit any more options than pregnancy itself does? This extraordinary book tells fifty stories about women from strikingly diverse backgrounds who have had to choose whether to give birth or to abort. About half of these women carried their pregnancies to term; the others ended them. Their decisions arose from heartfelt struggles, expressed in terms completely different from those that prevail in the public debate. Some women who abhor abortion ended up choosing that option; others who are prochoice opted for birth or had abortions that, in some instances, caused them sorrow or regret. The outcome of nearly every private dilemma hung on practical and emotional matters - the quality of the connection between the woman and the man, the financial resources available, the number of children the woman already had, the state of her self-esteem, and the health of the fetus - rather than on the weighing of rights. These insightful and eloquent authors hold up a mirror to our society and show us that we have pitted mother against fetus. They ask whether we have emphasized the rights of individuals at the expense of human responsibility and care. This most intellectually challenging yet sensitive book transcends all other books on this topic. The complexity and rich nuances of the stories it tells permits us to see this controversy with new eyes. These stories, woven together, are our nation's story - one that has never been told by the long and angry debate. O"

"Ninety-nine More Maggots, Mites, And Munchers",['May R. Berenbaum'],"May R. Berenbaum's initial collection of insect cameos, Ninety-nine Gnats, Nits, and Nibblers, was praised by Library Journal as an ""illuminating book that may turn the disgust with which many people greet these fascinating creatures to curiosity and admiration."" This companion volume runs the gamut from the regrettably familiar, including mosquitoes, ticks, cockroaches, and what the author describes as ""other arthropodan indignities,"" to the bizarre and obscure, creatures such as sheep keds, mantispids, and reindeer throat bots. Berenbaum's aim is to bring science as painlessly as possible to those who thirst for knowledge about the little beings they encounter in their homes, gardens, and backyards - or on their bodies - but who have neither the patience nor the expertise to track down and read scientific texts. Combining a naturalist's keen observation of the subject with witty wordplay and amazing anecdotes, Berenbaum has provided a uniquely informative and entertaining book, useful not only for the scientific novice but also for entomologists who need a handy guide for their own use or for use in teaching, especially in introductory classes.

                        <p>The clever author of the acclaimed Ninety-Nine Gnats, Nits, and Nibblers offers a companion volume that runs the gamut from the regrettably familiar, including ticks, cockroaches, and mosquitoes, to bizarre and obscure creatures such as sheep keds, mantispids, and reindeer throat bobs.

How The Maya Built Their World: Energetics And Ancient Architecture,['Elliot M. Abrams'],"Maya architecture is often described as ""massive"" and ""monumental,"" but experiments at Copan, Honduras, convinced Elliot Abrams that 300 people could have built one of the large palaces there in only 100 days. 
<p>In this groundbreaking work, Abrams explicates his theory of architectural energetics, which involves translating structures into volumes of raw and manufactured materials that are then multiplied by the time required for their production and assembly to determine the labor costs of past construction efforts. Applying this method to residential structures of the Late Classic period (A.D. 700-900) at Copan leads Abrams to posit a six-tiered hierarchic social structure of political decision making, ranging from a stratified elite to low-ranking commoners. By comparing the labor costs of construction and other economic activities, he also prompts a reconsideration of the effects of royal construction demands on commoners.<br>

"Oil, Banks, And Politics: The United States And Postrevolutionary Mexico, 1917-1924",['Linda B. Hall'],"Mexico was second only to the United States as the world's largest oil producer in the years following the Mexican Revolution. As the revolutionary government became institutionalized, it sought to assure its control of Mexico's oil resources through the Constitution of 1917, which returned subsoil rights to the nation. This comprehensive study explores the resulting struggle between oil producers, many of which were U.S. companies, and the Mexican government.
<p>Linda Hall goes beyond the diplomacy to look at the direct impact of a powerful, highly profitable foreign-controlled industry on a government and a nation trying to recover from a major civil war. She draws on extensive research in Mexican archives, including both government sources and the private papers of Presidents Alvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles, as well as U.S. government and private sources.</p>
<p> As the North American Free Trade Agreement expands United States business ties to Mexico, this study of a crucial moment in U.S.-Mexican business relations will be of interest to a wide audience in business, diplomatic, and political history.</p>"

Michelangelo And His Drawings,['Michael Hirst'],"Michelangelo was a master draftsman whose striking and powerful drawings are not only an important part of his artistic heritage in their own right but are also a means of viewing his designs that have not otherwise survived. In this book Michael Hirst describes and analyzes Michelangelo's drawings in light of the many purposes for which the artist made them, thereby reaching for the first time a full understanding of their character and appearance. The product of thirty years of careful thought and examination of the original drawings, it provides the reader with new insights into the working methods and the mental processes of one of the most original of all artists. .<br>"

"Joyce, Decadence, And Emancipation",['Vivian Heller'],"Modernism has long been seen as either a symptom of decadence or a sign of emancipation. Vivian Heller argues that Joyce's writing cannot be categorized as either decadent or emancipatory because it is predicated on the dialectical intimacy of these two terms. Heller relies on Joyce's changing use of epiphany to trace the arc of his development, focusing on the negative epiphanies of Dubliners, the relativistic epiphanies of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and the retrospective epiphanies of Ulysses."

Unmarried Couples,['Elliot D. Samuelson'],"Most adults will, at some time in their lives, either through divorce, widowhood, or choice, find themselves cohabiting with another person in an informal living arrangement. Unaware of the legal and psychological ramifications inherent in these informal arrangements, individuals may be totally unprepared for the financial, property, inheritance, and other obligations they are likely to encounter as a result of such a relationship. Unmarried Couples: A Guide to Your Legal Rights and Obligations by Elliot D. Samuelson, J.D., a renowned expert in family law, is perhaps the first book of its kind to explain in clear, cogent, readable language the risks incurred and rights to be expected from this increasingly accepted lifestyle. To anyone wishing to be thoroughly informed on the laws governing nonmarital domestic partnership - laws which, though now in their infancy, are developing rapidly - Unmarried Couples is a vital asset. It provides state-of-the-art information on such central issues as property distribution, inheritance rights, equitable distribution divisions, child support and custody, doctrine of implied adoption, and obligations to support, including advanced education. In addition, explained in careful detail are written and oral agreements (to avoid legal entanglements), state-by-state legal recognition of common-law marriage, gay and lesbian unions, AIDS and its legal consequences (including lawsuits for money damages), ""living together"" and prenuptial agreements and obligations of financial support, Social Security and Medicare benefits as these relate to senior citizens, living wills, healthcare proxies, chronic illness, and choosing an attorney or healthcare professional. The book also includes an extensive section of sample documents, including living together and prenuptial agreement forms, Social Security benefit rate charts, living wills, retainer forms, and child support forms, as well as lists of states recognizing common-law marriages, gay"
Modern Art In The Common Culture,['Thomas Crow'],"Must avant-garde art hold itself apart from the values and beliefs widely held in the common culture? Must advanced artists always be the symbolic adversaries of the ordinary citizen? These questions have dominated, even paralyzed the modern art world, particularly in recent years when perceived elitism and imposed canons of taste have come under fire from all sides. In this stimulating book, a prominent art historian shows that the links between advanced art and modern mass culture have always been robust, indeed necessary to both. Thomas Crow focuses on the continual interdependence between the two phenomena, providing examples that range from Paris in the mid-nineteenth century to the latest revivals of Conceptual art in the 1990s."
The Greeks,['Kenneth Dover'],"My Greeks were neither sophisticated layabouts nor pious fatalists, and least of all were they portentous gurus brooding over the lost Secrets of the Ancients. They were a resilient, sceptical, cheeky people, whose distinctive contribution to our history was to combine a readiness to ask 'Why?' and 'Why not?' with a conviction that only sane, reasoned and clearly expounded answers to those questions were worth listening to. In this book, Kenneth Dover introduces the people and culture of ancient Greece."
The Crooked Stovepipe: Athapaskan Fiddle Music And Square Dancing In Northeast Alaska And Northwest Canada (music In American Life),['Craig Mishler'],"Named for a popular local fiddle tune, The Crooked Stovepipe is a rollicking, detailed, first-ever study of the indigenous fiddle music and social dancing enjoyed by the Gwich'in Athapaskan Indians and other tribal groups in northeast Alaska, the Yukon, and the northwest territories. Though the music has obvious roots in the British Isles, French Canada, and the American South, the Gwich'in have used it in shaping their own aesthetic, which is apparent in their choice of fiddle tunings, bowing techniques, foot clogging, and a distinctively stratified tune repertoire. Craig Mishler treats this rural subarctic artistic tradition as a distinctive regional style akin to Cajun, bluegrass, or string-band music. He uses convergence theory as the framework for showing how this aesthetic came about. His skillful use of personal anecdotes, interviews, music examples, dance diagrams, and photographs will appeal to general readers interested in folk music and dance, as well as to specialists."
The Year She Disappeared: A Novel (james A. Michener),['Ann Harleman'],"Nan and her four-year-old granddaughter Jane are taking their first airplane trip together, flying from Seattle to the East Coast. But this is no ordinary excursion. Nan is abducting Jane. <br>
 Nan's own daughter, Alex, believes Jane's father has been sexually abusing her, and she's asked Nan to take her away, to hide her.

A Dreamer Of Pictures: Neil Young: The Man And His Music,['David Downing'],"Neil Young is arguably the only rock performer and songwriter whose work has retained the respect of a large following while gaining the allegiance of new generations. He has demonstrated a unique ability to combine commercial success with a willful experimentation. His music has encompassed almost every American popular style, from folk to metal, from rockabilly to punk, from rhythm and blues to country; and it is his restless pursuit of new challenges that has led on the one hand to his recognition as one of the few stars who refuses to ""sell out,"" and on the other hand to his being sued by his record company for making albums that were not ""characteristic of Neil Young."" In <i>A Dreamer of Pictures</i>, David Downing paints an illuminating and entertaining portrait of this contradictory and enigmatic figure. Here we see his childhood in Canada and his first forays into musicmaking; his ups and downs with Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and Crazy Horse; the privations and excesses of life on the road; his unconventional filmmaking and fundraising ventures; his often absurd political pronouncements; his two marriages; his involvement with his younger son's therapy to combat cerebral palsy; and his continuing musical evolution.Neil Young has taken rock beyond generational boundaries and has helped to establish it as a unique art form; <i>A Dreamer of Pictures</i> is thus a portrait not only of Young, but of rock itself."
Inventing The Flat Earth: Columbus And Modern Historians,['Jeffrey Burton Russell'],"Neither Christopher Columbus nor his contemporaries thought the earth was flat. Yet this curious illusion persists today, firmly established with the help of the media, textbooks, teachers--even noted historians. Inventing the Flat Earth is Russell's attempt to set the record straight. He begins with a discussion of geographical knowledge in the Middle Ages, examining what Columbus and his contemporaries actually did believe, and then moves to a look at how the error was first propagated in the 1820s and 1830s and then ""snowballed"" to outrageous proportions by the late 19th century. But perhaps the most intriguing focus of the book is the reason why we allow this error to persist. Do we prefer to languish in a comfortable and familiar error rather than exert the effort necessary to discover the truth? This uncomfortable question is engagingly answered."
The Techniques Of Basketry,['Virginia I. Harvey'],"Never before have so many varieties of basketry techniques from so many parts of the world been covered in a single volume. The traditional methods-coiling, twining, wickerwork, splintwork, and plaiting-are described in detail, and special attention is given to the specific materials, beginnings, and finishes appropriate to each."

A gold mine of common sense and sound advice, her guide remains an indispensable tool for choosing books for children of all ages."
Django Reinhardt (the Roots Of Jazz),['Charles Delaunay'],"No European jazz musician has so enchanted the world as Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist whose recordings with Stephane Grappelly and the Hot Club of France have meant 'The Thirties' to several generations of listeners, influencing musicians as far afield as Larry Coryell, Leon Redbone, Eddy Lang, and Charlie Christian.This is the only full-length study of Django ever published in English, an unforgettable portrait of a wild and independent figure who never learned to read or write (friends forged his autographs), exasperated those people who lived by schedules, gambled away a week's salary in a night, but who played guitar like no one before or since."
The Environmental Protection Hustle (harvard-mit Joint Center For Urban Studies Series),['Bernard J. Frieden'],"No one likes ticky-tacky houses spread all over the landscape and invading the suburbs, least of all the people who already live there. But are environmentalists and suburbanites right when they object? Bernard Frieden, Professor of Urban Planning at MIT, doesn't think so. At least not when their objections take the form that they have in northern California. In this lively and certainly controversial book, Frieden uncovers a powerful, ideologically driven crusade to keep the average citizen from homeownership and the good life in the suburbs. Written in the best tradition of civic reform, Frieden's observations are a warning signal to environmentalists, whose concerns may backfire, and to homebuilders and the general public in other parts of the country where projects for urban growth may soon run up against the protectionist's blockade.
<p>In a series of case studies involving Marin County, Alameda, Oakland, Palo Alto, San Mateo County, and Contra Costa Couny, Frieden carefully documents instances where builders and developers attempting to construct new housing have found themselves harassed by a network of environmental regulations, public officials, and citizen crusaders. The no-growth tactics of these groups include placing land in agricultural preserves, raising the minimum lot size for single family houses, declaring moratoria on new water and sewer connections, setting explicit growth quotas, and charging thousands of dollars in public utilities ""hookup"" fees for each new house. Eyewitness accounts throughout the book recreate the noisy and contentious atmosphere of community meetings with developers and planning commissions.</p>
<p>Frieden asserts that the connections between housing and serious environmental issues such as pollution, use of toxic substances, nuclear testing hazards, and the conservation of natural resources are few and minor. The attack on homebuilding does not follow from the central concerns of the Sierra Club and other environmental groups but stretches the environmental agenda to phony issues—issues that have been used Marin-County style to legitimize arrogant public policies designed to keep the average citizen from using the land, while preserving the social and fiscal advantages of the influential few.</p>
<p>Middle-class citizens are in fact being hustled. The environmental controversies Frieden documents have already discouraged large, planned-unit developments with community open space, driven up the cost of housing, and promoted a return to 1950's style building practices of expensive freestanding single-family homes, each on its own lot in small, exclusive developments at the urban fringe.</p>"
Winning The Peace: America And World Order In The New Era,"['Ruggie, John Gerard , 1944-']","No period in recent history has been as tumultous as the last half-decade. John Ruggie's <i>Winning the Peace</i> puts the years since the end of the cold war in their proper historical context. Understanding the policies, theories, and impulses that affected international relations during this period helps the reader acquire an enlightened perspective on the present and develop a vision for the future. Notwithstanding popular catchphrases, world affairs are never orderly in practice. Yet, with Ruggie's insight, we can at least bring some structure to how we perceive the world."

Queens Consort: England's Medieval Queens,['Lisa Hilton'],"Occupying a unique position in the mercurial, often violent world of medieval state-craft, England’s medieval queens were elemental in shaping the history of the monarchy and the nation. Lisa Hilton’s meticulously researched new work explores the lives of the 20 women crowned between 1066 and 1503. She reconsiders the fictions surrounding well-known figures like Eleanor of Aquitaine, illuminates the lives of forgotten queens such as Adeliza of Louvain, and shows why they all had to negotiate a role that combined tremendous influence with terrifying vulnerability. The result is a provocative and dramatic narrative that redefines English history."

Trent 1475: Stories of a Ritual Murder Trial,['R. Pochia Hsia'],"On Easter Sunday, 1475, the dead body of a two-year-old boy named Simon was found in the cellar of a Jewish family's house in Trent, Italy. Town magistrates arrested all eighteen Jewish men and one Jewish woman living in Trent on the charge of ritual murder - the killing of a Christian child in order to use his blood in Jewish religious rites. Under judicial torture and imprisonment, the men confessed and were condemned to death; their women-folk, who had been kept under house arrest with their children, denounced the men under torture and eventually converted to Christianity. A papal hearing in Rome about possible judicial misconduct in Trent made the trial widely known and led to a wave of anti-Jewish propaganda and other accusations of ritual murder against the Jews. In this engrossing book, R. Pochia Hsia reconstructs the events of this tragic persecution, drawing principally on the Yeshiva Manuscript, a detailed trial record made by authorities in Trent to justify their execution of the Jews and to bolster the case for the canonization of little Martyr Simon. Hsia depicts the Jewish victims (whose testimonies contain fragmentary stories of their tragic lives as well as forced confessions of kidnap, torture, and murder), the prosecuting magistrates, the hostile witnesses, and the few Christian neighbors who tried in vain to help the Jews. Setting the trial and its documents in the historical context of medieval blood libel, Hsia vividly portrays how fact and fiction can be blurred, how judicial torture can be couched in icy orderliness and impersonality, and how religious rites can be interpreted as ceremonies of barbarism."

On intimate terms,['Burch'],"On Intimate Terms looks at the internal logic of lesbian relationships, arguing that they are not patterned after heterosexual ones but rely on the interplay of psychosexual differences between women. The book suggests that everyone seeks psychic complementarity with an Other in intimate relationships as a way of supporting personal growth and development. A complementary partner is one who is different in some individually meaningful way, not necessarily in terms of gender. Drawing upon interviews with individuals and lesbian couples, literature on lesbian psychology, and contemporary psychoanalytic theory, Beverly Burch observes a special attraction between primary lesbians - women who have been attracted to other women from an early age - and lesbians who formerly were heterosexual. This difference may be a source of tension for lovers, but it also attracts and bonds them in conscious and unconscious ways. The intimacy between lesbian partners permits interpersonal exchanges that foster the continuing development of each, according to Burch. This development can occur in three areas, with the significance of each varying from couple to couple. It can be a source of both conscious and unconscious psychosexual exchanges, a way in which each partner can experience the road not taken through her relationship with the other. The partners' different histories can reflect different ways of negotiating difference itself, a pivotal theme in the development of adult women. And gender role identities related to different developmental experiences can be played with, expanding the experience of being female in a way that can challenge gender categories."

The Centralia tragedy of 1919: Elmer Smith and the Wobblies,"['Copeland, Tom , 1950-']","On November 11, 1919, the citizens of Centralia, Washington, gathered to watch former servicemen, local Boy Scouts, and other community groups march in the Armistice Day parade. When the marchers swung past the meeting hall of the Industrial Workers of the World, a group of veterans broke ranks, charged the hall, and were met by gunshots. Before the day was over, four of the marchers were dead and one of the Wobblies had been lynched by the mob. Through a wealth of newly available primary source material including previously sealed court documents, FBI records released under the Freedom of Information Act, and interviews with surviving witnesses, Tom Copeland has pieced together the events of that day and has traced the fate of the men who were accused and convicted of murdering the marchers. Copeland focuses on Elmer Smith, the local attorney who advised the Wobblies that they had the right to defend their hall against an anticipated attack. Although he never belonged to the I.W.W., Smith sympathized with their interests, championing the rights of working people and speaking on their behalf. He was originally arrested with the Wobblies and then took up their cause in the courts, beginning a life-long struggle to free the men who were charged with murdering the Centralia marchers. The fight lasted for fourteen years, during which Smith endured insults, threats, arrest, disbarment, and reinstatement. Copeland recounts Smith's run for political office, his speeches throughout the Northwest, and his unyielding support for the workers' cause. In 1932 he died at the age of forty-four. The book is a balanced treatment of the Centralia tragedy and its legal repercussions written by a practicing lawyer. It is also a compelling human drama, centering on the marginal life of an industrial frontier labor lawyer; a study of radical politics of the 1920s; and a depiction of conditions of life in the lumber camps and towns. It is thus biography as well as legal, political, a"
Research Directions In Object-oriented Programming,"['Shriver, Bruce D.', 'Wegner, Peter.']","Once a radical notion, object-oriented programming is one of today's most active research areas. It is especially well suited to the design of very large software projects involving many programmers all working on the same project.

Northrop Frye On Shakespeare,['Northrop Frye'],"One of the greatest literary critics of our time here provides a remarkable introduction to the genius of William Shakespeare through a study of ten of Shakespeare's most popular plays: A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, Henry IV, Measure for Measure, Hamlet, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest. The outgrowth of a lifetime of study and teaching, Frye's insights will inform and delight both the expert and the first-time reader of Shakespeare."
Babe: The Life And Legend Of Babe Didrikson Zaharias (women In American History),['Susan E. Cayleff'],"One of the most gifted athletes of all time, Babe Didrikson Zaharias dominated track and field, winning two Olympic gold medals and a controversial silver in 1932 before going on to compete in baseball, bowling, basketball, tennis, and particularly in golf. An American public smitten with her wit, frankness, and ""unladylike"" bravado helped her become an American legend. In Babe, Susan Cayleff offers a comprehensive, in-depth biography of a woman who was a great athlete at a time when women's roles and opportunities were severely limited. Through interviews with Babe's friends and family, golf peers, and medical personnel, Cayleff sensitively reveals the life and probes the legend of this unusual American hero. Included is a for-the-record discussion of the remarkable love Babe shared with Betty Dodd, the young golfer who was her constant companion in her last years. Stricken with cancer in her prime, Babe went public as a self-help role model able to beat the disease. Her bravery further endeared her to the American public.

Napoleonic Infantry: Napoleonic Weapons And Warfare (napoleonic Weapons & Warfare),['Philip J. Haythornthwaite'],"One of the world's leading Napoleonic authorities, supported by over 100 period illustrations, tells the surprising story of what actually happened in the emperor's infantry battles as compared to what should have occurred if they'd gone by the regulation book. Descriptions of infantry weapons feature the muskets, bayonets, pikes, and swords that were so important in battle, while accounts from those who were there show how they were employed in attack and defense. Many misconceptions are clarified--including why the soldiers had such high regard for the bayonet when it inflicted few casualties. This perceptive study shows why the winning is in the details--and the proper management of all those arms.<br>"

Ontic: A Knowledge Representation System For Mathematics (artificial Intelligence),"['Mcallester', 'David A.']","ONTIC, the interactive system for verifying ""natural"" mathematical arguments that David McAllester describes in this book, represents a significant change of direction in the field of mechanical deduction, a key area in computer science and artificial intelligence.
<p>ONTIC is an interactive theorem prover based on novel forward chaining inference techniques. It is an important advance over such earlier systems for checking mathematical arguments as Automath, Nuprl, and the Boyer Moore system. The first half of the book provides a high-level description of the ONTIC system and compares it with these and other automated theorem proving and verification systems. The second half presents a complete formal specification of the inference mechanisms used.</p>
<p>McAllester's is the only semi automated verification system based on classical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. It uses object oriented inference, a unique automated inference mechanism for a syntactic variant of first order predicate calculus. The book shows how the ONTIC system can be used to check such serious proofs as the proof of the Stone representation theorem without expanding them to excessive detail.</p>

D-Day 1944 (Praeger Illustrated Military History Series): Gold and Juno Beaches,['Ken Ford'],"Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, was the greatest sea-borne military operation in history. At the heart of the invasion and key to its success were the landings of British 50th Division on Gold Beach and Canadian 3rd Division on Juno Beach. Not only did they provide the vital link between the landings of British 3rd Division on Sword Beach and the Americans to the west on Omaha, they would be crucial to the securing of the beachhead and the drive inland to Bayeux and Caen. In the fourth D-Day volume, Ken Ford details the assault that began the liberation of Nazi-occupied Europe."
"Opposite Poles: Immigrants And Ethnics In Polish Chicago, 1976–1990",['Mary Patrice Erdmans'],"Opposite Poles presents a fascinating and complex portrait of ethnic life in America. The focus is Chicago Polonia, the largest Polish community outside of Warsaw. During the 1980s a new cohort of Polish immigrants from communist Poland, including many refugees from the Solidarity movement, joined the Polish American ethnics already settled in Chicago. The two groups shared an ancestral homeland, social space in Chicago, and the common goal of wanting to see Poland become an independent noncommunist nation. These common factors made the groups believe they ought to work together and help each other; but they were more often at opposite poles. The specious solidarity led to contentious conflicts as the groups competed for political and cultural ownership of the community.
<p>Erdmans's dramatic account of intracommunity conflict demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between immigrants and ethnics in American ethnic studies. Drawing upon interviews, participant observation in the field, surveys, and Polish community press accounts, she describes the social differences between the two groups that frustrated unified collective action.</p>
<p>We often think of ethnic and racial communities as monolithic, but the heterogeneity within Polish Chicago is by no means unique. Today in the United States new Chinese, Israeli, Haitian, and Mexican immigrants negotiate their identities within the context of the established identities of Asians, Jews, Blacks, and Chicanos. Opposite Poles shows that while common ancestral heritage creates the potential for ethnic allegiance, it is not a sufficient condition for collective action.</p>"
A Digital Design Methodology For Optical Computing,['Miles Murdocca'],"Optical computing can have significant advantages over electronic computing in terms of system speed, but only if the digital design exploits regularity. The design methods must be simple in order to manage the complexity of optics in a digital computer. This book presents a valuable new methodology for simplifying the design of digital circuits for systems that use optics as an interconnection medium. The methodology utilizes the potential of optics in computers by mapping arbitrary logic functions onto regular hardware structures, such as optical programmable logic arrays.
<p>Murdocca, provides a brief history of the field and looks at current research trends, including the creation of regular arrays of identical logic gates and the need for small, easily manufacturable optical systems. He covers alternative approaches to designing a digital optical computer and then shows in detail how to design regularity into digital optical circuits using simple methods that yield high performance without introducing significant complexity into the target machine. In the process, he points out the exciting potential offered by regular free-space interconnects, such as the possibility of completely reconfiguring the gate-to-gate interconnects of a computer on every time step.</p>
<p>Three case studies in design - a wideband digital switch, the Rutgers CAM, and Thinking Machine's CM-1 Connection Machine - illustrate Murdocca's approach.</p>

Ecological Psychology: Creating A More Earth-friendly Human Nature,['George S. Howard'],"Our world now faces several ecological threats (e.g., global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, deforestation, soil poisoning, water pollution, desertification) that could make life in the twenty-first century nightmarish. All of these threats are human produced. Thus, alterations in humans' thoughts, actions, and lifestyles must be important parts of the problems' solutions. The twin engines of ecological destruction are human overpopulation and overconsumption (i.e., unsustainable lifestyles). Both of these aspects of human nature are malleable to social/political and psychological interventions. Psychologists should become involved in dealing with impending ecological threats, since ecological degradation will be one of the leading causes of human pain and suffering in the next century."
Our Unsettled Constitution: A New Defense of Constitutionalism and Judicial Review,['Louis Michael Seidman'],"Ours is an age of growing doubt about constitutional theory and of outright hostility to any theory that defends judicial review. Why should a tiny number of unelected judges be able to validate or invalidate laws on such politically controversial issues as abortion, religion, gender, and sex-or even determine how the president is elected? In this provocative book, a leading constitutional theorist offers an entirely original defense of judicial review. Louis Michael Seidman argues that judicial review is defensible if we set aside common but erroneous assumptions-that constitutional law should be independent from our political commitments and that the role of constitutional law is to settle political disagreement. Seidman develops a theory of 'unsettlement.' A constitution that unsettles, that destabilizes outcomes produced by the political process, creates no permanent losers nursing deep-seated grievances, he says. An 'unsettling' constitution helps to build a community founded on consent by enticing losers into a continuing conversation. The author applies this theory to an array of well-known cases heard by the Supreme Court over the past several decades, including the fall 2000 election decision.<p>Author Biography: Louis Michael Seidman is professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. He is co-author of a widely respected constitutional law casebook and author of numerous articles on criminal justice and constitutional law.</p>"
Optimizing Special Education,['Nancy O. Wilson'],"Over 10 percent of children in the United States receive special education, yet many families are unaware of the extensive help available through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), most of which is free of charge. Optimizing Special Education explains clearly what parents can expect from special services, mainstreaming, due process procedures, and laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Buckley Amendment. Nancy O. Wilson, a recognized authority on families with special-needs children, shows parents and caregivers how to use education laws to increase related services, such a speech and physical therapy, how to change education to suit a child's unique needs, and strategies to improve a student's vocational options. Parents new to special education, as well as more experienced individuals, will learn techniques for raising a learning-disabled child, in particular: participating in planning a child's individualized education program (IEP); finding effective services for children who do not qualify for special education; keeping track of test results and school records; strengthening a child's social skills for eventual mainstreaming into society; developing ideas for school conferences; maintaining satisfactory parent-professional partnerships from early intervention to vocational training; increasing benefits for special-needs children in ""special"" and integrated settings; and recognizing and addressing problems of young adults with learning disabilities. In addition, this impressive resource includes a sample IEP, a list of helpful books and periodicals, agencies, support groups, and a glossary of educational terms. Along with offering poignant personal anecdotes about rearing her own special-needs child, the compelling experiences of other parents, and input from professionals in the field, Ms. Wilson explores the sensitive family feelings that arise when interacting with service providers and educators in order to f"

Terrorism And The Media: From The Iran Hostage Crisis To The World Trade Center Bombing,"['Nacos, Brigitte Lebens.']","Over the last fifteen years, incidents of terrorism have become increasingly common. Until recently, however, Americans believed that such violent acts would not occur on American soil. The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building were rude awakenings. In this important, up-to-date study, Brigitte L. Nacos contends that terrorists are very successful at exploiting the vital links among the news media, public opinion, and decision making - a pattern which the author calls a calculus of violence. She demonstrates that terrorism works because media coverage influences the American public to support government responses that protect the victims of terrorism, most of all hostages, at the expense of the national interest. In a new Preface for the paperback edition, Nacos includes important recent events, showing how right-wing radio talk shows, Penthouse, and The New York Times all played pivotal roles in articulating the causes of terrorists such as the Michigan Militia and the Unabomber."

Slick Spins and Fractured Facts: How Cultural Myths Distort the News,['Caryl Rivers'],"P.M.S. Affects Millions. More Blacks in Prison Than in College. Working Women Stressed Out. Campus Thought Police Vs. Free Speech. Asian Influx Raises Questions On Campus.<br> We read headlines like these in newspapers and magazines every day, or hear them on television and radio broadcasts, and we're expected to take them at face value. But can we really believe that the media are giving us just the facts? Veteran journalist Caryl Rivers investigates the story behind All the News That's Fit to Print. In <i>Slick Spins and Fractured Facts,</i> she demonstrates that the news is whatever the homogenous clan that runs America's print and broadcast media says it is.<br> In this witty, persuasive, on-target book, Rivers turns the camera back on the media, taking a hard look at the players who shape the news. She shows how this group--upper-middle-class whites--filters the news through their barely recognized self-interest and ideologies.<br> Slick Spins and Fractured Facts presents a raucous wealth of examples showing how the interests, values and viewpoints of this close-knit group inform the stories that appear again and again in the American media. The result is the perpetuation of gender, race, and class stereotypes from one generation to the next, as the media focus on problems of the present while paying scant attention to history and the mistakes of the past. Other perspectives, she contends, are usually considered biased: a gay journalist, for instance, must go to great lengths to prove that he or she can be impartial.<br> Drawing on a rich array of news stories, Riversexplores the media's typical treatment of women, African Americans, welfare recipients, immigrants, crime and criminality, and multiculturalism.

Recycled Papers: The Essential Guide,['Claudia Thompson'],"Paper is the largest single component of municipal solid waste, and the recycling of paper must be part of any resolution to the current garbage crisis. Because there are no uniform standards for the generic term ""recycled,"" it is still difficult for paper users to make environmentally responsible purchasing decisions. Myths, misinformation, and confusion abound. This first comprehensive guide to recycled printing and writing papers will therefore be an invaluable resource for anyone involved with printing, production, design, or issues of recycling in general. The book itself, printed on four different types of recycled paper, is a demonstration of the quality that informed designers and publishers can achieve.

Political Will and Personal Belief: The Decline and Fall of Soviet Communism,['Paul Hollander'],"Paul Hollander focuses on the human aspects of the failure of Soviet communism.

Peace And War,['Robert Serber'],"Peace and War is the memoir of one of the key scientists involved in the atomic bomb and the chief research assistant and intimate friend of J. Robert Oppenheimer. A prominent member of the Manhattan Project, Robert Serber was one of a team of scientists who assembled the bombs on Tinian Island for transport to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was also one of the first Americans to walk among the Japanese ruins after the catastrophe. Serber tells movingly of his wartime experiences at Tinian Island and in Japan, in letters to his wife, Charlotte, herself a key player at Los Alamos and the only female group leader there. These letters depict simply - almost dispassionately - what Serber saw: the rows of iron office safes protruding from the rubble of Hiroshima; the grazing horse whose hair had been scorched on one side by the fireball but was untouched on the other; the B-29s stacked on the runway ""like cars coming back to a city on a Sunday night."" Serber is also eloquent about the troubles he faced as a result of his refusal to take part in public debate about the morality of his wartime work; how his opposition to rapidly developing the hydrogen bomb earned him the enmity of Edward Teller and others; how he was investigated and his security clearance challenged, several years before Oppenheimer's. Serber also recounts many previously untold stories involving Oppenheimer, Murray Gell-Mann, Ernest O. Lawrence, Edward Teller, and others. This portrait of one of the most important theoretical physicists of the 20th century brings to life the excitement of Oppenheimer's close-knit circle; the controversy of the Manhattan Project; and the thrill of being present at the creation of so many pioneering discoveries, from black holes to quarks."
Philip V Of Spain: The King Who Reigned Twice,['Henry Kamen'],"Philip V, who reluctantly assumed the Spanish throne in 1700, was the first of the Bourbon dynasty which continues to rule Spain today. His 46-year reign, briefly curtailed in 1724 when he abdicated in favour of his short-lived son, Louis I, was one of the most important in the country's history. This highly readable account is the first biography of Philip V in English.
<p> Previous writing on Philip has been largely negative, dismissing him as comic, stupid and indolent. Henry Kamen demonstrates here, however, that the king initiated significant developments in politics, imperial policy, finance, government and military affairs that laid the basis of the modern Spanish state. Philip also encouraged literature, the creative arts and music in ways that brought Spanish culture closer in touch with the rest of Europe, and he dealt authoritatively with issues concerning the autonomy of the provinces of Spain and the role of the monarchy itself. Drawing on contemporary opinion and fresh archival sources, Kamen discusses Philip's character, decisions and policies. He offers a new assessment of the king's illness (which led earlier historians to view Philip as mad) and re-evaluates the role of his two wives. Kamen's account of Philip as king also provides an essential introduction to the study of early eighteenth-century Spain and the Bourbon monarchy.</p>"

"The Jews: history, memory, and the present","['Vidal-naquet, Pierre , 1930-2006']","Pierre Vidal-Naquet, internationally celebrated author of Assassins of Memory: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust, here takes readers on a fascinating journey through key phases of Jewish history over more than two millennia. Drawing on a vast reservoir of historical knowledge, Vidal-Naquet unravels a series of myths and ideologies that have become entangled with Jewish history over the centuries. The Jews covers subjects as deep in the past as the Jewish encounter with Hellenization in the second century B.C.E., and as current as modern-day Israeli-Palestinian relations. The Jews opens in the classical period, looking in particular at the work of Flavius Josephus, who wrote the original account of the events at Masada. Resisting the powerful currents of ideological orthodoxy, Vidal-Naquet examines what he views as Israeli nationalist distortions of the historical and archaeological record at Masada. In the promotion of an ideal of Jewish unity in the ancient world, he contends, some have chosen to ignore evidence of pluralism, civil strife, and the power of the Diaspora experience in the Jewish past. The book continues with an engaging discussion of the era of Jewish emancipation in Europe, during the French Revolution and thereafter, in which Vidal-Naquet explores the complex meanings of emancipation and assimilation. Employing previously unexamined material written by Alfred Dreyfus himself, he continues with a reevaluation of the Dreyfus affair, the episode of anti-Semitism and betrayal that shook France at the turn of the century. The Jews explores books, films, and eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust, including works by Arno Mayer, Claude Lanzmann, and Primo Levi. The book looks also at a recently published wartime journal by Vidal-Naquet's father, written in the years before he was deported. Vidal-Naquet is equally concerned with the disturbing phenomenon of Holocaust denial, pointing to the question of the gas chambers as central to refuting revisio"
"Joyce, Chaos and Complexity",['Thomas Jackson Rice'],"Placing Joyce in his cultural context, Rice first provocatively traces the previously unacknowledged formative influence of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries on Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. He then demonstrates that, when later innovations in science transformed entire worldviews, Joyce recognized conventional literary modes of representation as offering merely arbitrary constructions of this new reality."
Plain Folk: The Life Stories Of Undistinguished Americans,['David M. Katzman'],"Plain Folk depicts both the ordinary occupations and ethnic and racial diversity of America at the turn of the century.

Authoritarian Fictions: The Ideological Novel As A Literary Genre,['Susan Rubin Suleiman'],"Political ideologies often informed early twentieth-century French novels, creating a hybrid genre that is both ""realist"" and didactic: the roman thse. In this ground-breaking and critically acclaimed work, Susan Suleiman looks beyond the politics of novels by such authors as Malraux, Mauriac, Sartre, and Aragon, and examines their shared formal and generic features. Although the genre itself is considered antimodern, the critical and interpretive problems it raises are central to an understanding of both realist and modernist writing. ""The great virtue of [Suleiman's] book is its ability to synthesize a range of theoretical ideas--whether formalist, structuralist or ""reader-response' in the service of a clear and compelling critical argument.""--Christopher Norris, The London Review of Books ""This book is certainly one of the best examples of semiotic theory put to use for interpretation of literature and its relation to culture.""--Thas Morgan, Genre"
Under His Very Windows: The Vatican And The Holocaust In Italy,['Susan Zuccotti'],"Pope Pius XII has often been criticized for his silence during the extermination of European Jewry during World War II. In his defense, some have alleged that the pope was doing a great deal to help the Jews but that his efforts were necessarily behind the scenes. This meticulously researched and balanced book examines exactly what the pope, his advisers, and his assistants at the Vatican Secretariat of State did to help the Jews of Italy. It finds that they did very little.
<p>The book begins by discussing prewar Vatican and Jesuit publications, in which Zuccotti uncovers a hitherto unsuspected prevalence of anti-Jewish sentiment. These publications, along with archival documents, indicate that Vatican protests against Italian anti-Jewish laws were limited to measures affecting converts and Jews in mixed marriages with Catholics, as was help with emigration; the papal nuncio's visits to foreign Jews in Italian internment camps did not differ from those to non-Jews and in no way eased their material discomfort; and interventions by diplomats of the Holy See for Jews threatened with deportation were rare, always polite, and seldom decisive.</p>
<p>Above all, Zuccotti finds no evidence of a papal directive to church institutions to shelter Jews and much evidence to suggest that the pope remained uninvolved. The notion that Pius XII was benevolent and helpful to Jews behind the scenes proves to be a myth.</p>

Horned Lizards,"['Jane Manaster', 'Wendy L. Hodges']","Popularly known as horny toads, horned lizards hold a special place in Southwestern life and lore. Images of horned lizards appear on the pottery and petroglyphs of the ancient Anasazi and Mimbres Indians, while today's Native Americans revere the lizard's power to change fortunes in health and happiness. Texas and Wyoming have chosen local horned lizard species as their official state reptile, reminding us of the lizard's important ecological role as well as its dwindling numbers.<p>This book offers an entertaining natural history of horned lizards for a general audience.

U. S. Special Forces : A Guide to America&#39;s Special Operations Units - the World&#39;s Most Elite Fighting Force,['Samuel A. Southworth'],"President George W. Bush has told all Americans that the war against terrorism would be like no other war. But what does this mean? Who will fight? How will they fight? What weapons will be used? Most informed commentators agree that the war against terrorism will be fought largely by special forces-that is, by a relatively new community within the American military known as Special Operations Forces, or SOF's. This new branch of the armed forces was created in the midÂ1980s and is organized under its own unified command, called U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Consisting of special units from the other branches of the armed forces, such as Green Berets, Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Force, this new fighting command is recognized internationally as the most well-trained and well-equipped special operations force in the world. Their missions are varied-including combat terrorism, search and rescue, reconnaissance, humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping duty, and conventional and unconventional warfare.Despite special forcesâ international reputation for excellence, Americans know little about this remarkable fighting force. <i>U.S. Special Forces</i> provides a handy and comprehensive compendium, including descriptions of the units and their operational specialties, training, and organization, as well as the equipment and technological gadgetry, weapons, armor, planes, helicopters, and support vehicles used by each unit."
Production/operations Management (irwin Series In Production Operations Management),['William J.

Technology And Privacy: The New Landscape,"['Philip E. Agre', 'Marc Rotenberg']","Privacy is the capacity to negotiate social relationships by controlling access to information about oneself. As laws, policies, and technological developments increasingly structure our relationships with social institutions, privacy faces new threats and new opportunities. The essays in this book provide a new conceptual framework for analyzing and debating privacy policy and for designing and developing information systems. The authors are international experts in the technical, economic, and political aspects of privacy; the book's particular strengths are its synthesis of these three aspects and its treatment of privacy issues in Canada and in Europe as well as in the United States."

William Goyen: selected letters from a writer's life,"['Goyen, William.']","Proclaimed ""one of the great American writers of short fiction"" by the New York Times Book Review, William Goyen (1915-1983) had a quintessentially American literary career, in which national recognition came only after years of struggle to find his authentic voice, his audience, and an artistic milieu in which to create. These letters, which span the years 1937 to 1983, offer a compelling testament to what it means to be a writer in America.
<p>A prolific correspondent, Goyen wrote regularly to friends, family, editors, and other writers. Among the letters selected here are those to such major literary figures as W. H. Auden, Archibald MacLeish, Joyce Carol Oates, William Inge, Elia Kazan, Elizabeth Spencer, and Katherine Anne Porter.</p>
<p>These letters constitute a virtual autobiography, as well as a fascinating introduction to Goyen's work. They add an important chapter to the study of American and Texas literature of the twentieth century.</p>"

Examples, taken from actual productions, are used to illustrate the kind of documentation needed to develop, run and control a production."
Coptic Art and Archaeology : The Art of the Christian Egyptians,['Alexander Badaway'],"Professor Alexander Badawy has written and profusely illustrated this rich study of the works of Coptic Egyptians starting in the early Christian period following the Antique and ending with the assimilation of Coptic art into that of Islam. <i>Coptic Art and Archaeology</i> is based on extensive archaeological excavations and on researchers' accounts. In developing his thesis on the nature of the Coptic spirit in the arts, Professor Badawy-an archaeologist and art historian-has drawn upon his own firsthand observations plus a wealth of materials from museums all over the world.<p>The result is a comprehensive examination of the Coptic arts. The text is illustrated with photographs (including the author's own), with plans of excavated sites, and with the author's restored perspectives. It is a journey through the sites and discoveries that have provided present knowledge of the Coptic civilization: a journey that included the architecture of houses and towns, fortified and unfortified monasteries, murals, paintings, and sculpture in several media, textiles, ceramics, and illuminated manuscripts. All are described in painstaking detail and historical context by the author.</p><p>Illustrations are keyed to the text, which in turn demonstrates that Coptic art was in many ways a people's art-an art of the middle and lower classes-and not invariably a religious art. Developments in style reflected the changing fortunes of the Egyptian Christians, and this, too, is carefully traced and the examples are noted in the text and in illustrations. Professor Badawy concludes the book with a study of the effects of Coptic art on European artistic traditions.</p><p>The remarkable comprehensiveness of this book will make it a basic tool of professional art historians and archaeologists, and it seems inevitable that the extensive and detailed descriptions of the extant works of Coptic artists will stimulate additional research into this area of art history. The professional and the student will find especially helpful the extensive footnotes, bibliography of international sources listed by subject area (e.g. Sculpture, Architecture, Painting), and the literally hundreds of illustrations that provide an unparalleled single-book source of examples of Coptic art. For those who cannot make the pilgrimage to the actual sites or visit the museum collections all over the world, Professor Badawy has provided the next best thing: a painstakingly detailed representative description of the treasures that are known.</p><p>This is also a book for the layman who can enjoy the evidences of the Coptic genius in ornamentation and gain an appreciation of the influences of history and politics on the art and culture of a people.</p>"

The Reformation Of Machismo: Evangelical Conversion And Gender In Columbia,['Elizabeth E. Brusco'],"Protestant evangelicalism has spread rapidly in Latin America at the same time that foreign corporations have taken hold of economies there. These concurrent developments have led some observers to view this religious movement as a means of melding converts into a disciplined work force for foreign capitalists rather than as a reflection of conscious individual choices made for a variety of personal, as well as economic, reasons.<br>
 In this pioneering study, Elizabeth Brusco challenges such assumptions and explores the intra-household motivations for evangelical conversion in Colombia. She shows how the asceticism required of evangelicals (no drinking, smoking, or extramarital sexual relations are allowed) redirects male income back into the household, thereby raising the living standard of women and children. This benefit helps explain the appeal of evangelicalism for women and questions the traditional assumption that organized religion always disadvantages women.<br>
 Brusco also demonstrates how evangelicalism appeals to men by offering an alternative to the more dysfunctional aspects of machismo. Case studies add a fascinating human dimension to her findings.<br>
 With the challenges this book poses to conventional wisdom about economic, gender, and religious behavior, it will be important reading for a wide audience in anthropology, women's studies, economics, and religion. For all students of Latin America, it offers thoughtful new perspectives on a major, grass-roots agent of social change.<br>"
"Greed, Chaos, And Governance: Using Public Choice To Improve Public Law",['Jerry L. Mashaw'],"Public choice theory should be taken seriously - but not too seriously. In this thought-provoking book, Jerry Mashaw stakes out a middle ground between those who champion public choice theory (the application of the conventional methodology of economics to political science matters, also known as rational choice theory) and those who disparage it. He argues that in many cases public choice theory's reach has exceeded its grasp. In others, public choice insights have not been pursued far enough by those who are concerned with the operation and improvement of legal institutions."
Demanding Democracy,['Robert Schmuhl'],"Public interest in the 1992 presidential campaign resulted in the highest electoral turnout since the heated, war-focused 1968 race involving Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, and George Wallace. In Demanding Democracy Robert Schmuhl examines the unparalleled interplay among citizens, political figures, and the media during the 1992 election year, arguing that a number of events - the hunger of an angry electorate for answers to their problems, the backlash against the sound-bites and negative spots of 1988, the impact of the ""New News"" with its proliferation of sources for political information, and Ross Perot's emergence as a presidential candidate - resulted in the people reshaping political institutions and the media as they demanded a more proximate and participatory democracy. After an introductory section, Schmuhl looks backward to 1992, examining in detail how George Bush, Ross Perot, and Bill Clinton were portrayed by different forms of popular communication. Some of the questions Schmuhl addresses in this section are: Why did George Bush lose the popularity he enjoyed in 1991 after the Persian Gulf War? What did the emergence of Ross Perot and his extensive use of television signify for American politics? And how was the relatively unknown Bill Clinton able to overcome doubts about his character to win the White House? In the final section Schmuhl looks forward, exploring the impact of new communication technology on the way in which we as citizens form our opinions, elect candidates, and participate in public life. He discusses the ""Information Highway,"" speculating if it will lead to more politically attuned voters, or to people more inclined to turn away from civic concerns toward personal pursuits. And finally, Schmuhl analyzes what the predicted demographic shifts over the next half-century will mean to political life in the United States."
The Negro in the Civil War,"['Benjamin Quarles', 'McFeeky William S', 'William S. McFeely']","Quarles writes powerfully about the role of three-and-a-half million blacks in the South, who were impressed into non-combatant service building forts and entrenchments, working in factories and mines. In the North, black Americans fought with distinction on the front lines, shedding blood for an ideal-emancipation-that was cruelly betrayed during Reconstruction."
Technology And The Afrian-american Experience: Needs And Opportunities For Study,"['Sinclair', 'Bruce [editor]']","Race and technology are two of the most powerful motifs in American history, but until recently they have not often been considered in relation to each other. This collection of essays examines the intersection of the two in a variety of social and technological contexts, pointing out, as the subtitle (borrowed from Brooke Hindle's classic 1966 work Early American Technology) puts it, the ""needs and opportunities for study."" The essays challenge what editor Bruce Sinclair calls the ""myth of black disingenuity"" -- the historical perception that black people were technically incompetent. Enslaved Africans actually brought with them the techniques of rice cultivation that proved so profitable to their white owners, and antebellum iron working in the South depended heavily on blacks' craft skills. The essays document the realities of black technical creativity -- in catalogs of patented inventiveness, in the use of ""invisible technologies"" such as sea chanteys, and in the mastery of complex new technologies. But the book also explores the economic and social functions of the disingenuity myth, and therefore its persistence. African-Americans often saw in new technologies a means to escape racial prejudice, but white Americans used them just as often to re-frame the boundaries of social behavior. The essays show that technologies and racialized thought are much more tightly connected than we have imagined."

William Wayne Justice: A Judicial Biography,['Frank R. Kemerer'],"Recent congressional battles over judicial appointments underscore an undeniable fact: judges, no less than legislators, can be public policymakers. William Wayne Justice has readily accepted this role, liberally interpreting the Constitution to meet the changing needs of society. As U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas, he has issued landmark reform decisions significantly affecting public institutions in Texas and across the nation. In this judicial biography, Frank Kemerer explores the factors that led to those decisions and made Justice one of the most controversial judges on the federal bench. Kemerer begins his study with Justice's formative years in the East Texas town of Athens. He follows Justice's entry into the legal profession, his brief involvement in politics, and his appointment as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas in 1961. More than half of the book is devoted to the cases decided by Judge Justice since his appointment to the federal bench in 1968. In addition, numerous influential decisions involving the First Amendment, voter discrimination, bilingual education, employment, and rights of the accused are included. Professor Kemerer presents the background of each case, followed by Justice's decision, reactions to it, and an assessment of the decision's impact. Interviewed over four years, Judge Justice speaks candidly about his life, his decisions, and his years on the bench. Kemerer enriches the discussion with insights gleaned from more than one hundred interviews with Justice's law clerks, court officials, plaintiffs, defendants, and others."
The Education Of A Senator,"['Dirksen, Everett Mckinley.']","Recently discovered in the archives of the Dirksen Congressional Center, this is the memoir Senator Dirksen was writing at the time of his death in 1969 - and his gravel-voiced warmth and wisdom come through on every page. Covering the years of his boyhood through his election to the Senate in 1950, The Education of a Senator reveals the foundation of a great public servant in the making. Although Dirksen was often criticized for changing his position, his admirers viewed his flexibility as an asset: a willingness to adapt thoughtfully to changing realities, instead of holding on to rigid views based on outdated circumstances. By his eloquence and clear vision, Dirksen drew national attention for his leadership in Congress, particularly for his role in civil rights legislation."
"Creating The New Woman: The Rise Of Southern Women's Progressive Culture In Texas, 1893-1918 (women In American History)",['Judith N. Mcarthur'],"Regionally distinct yet influenced by national trends, women's progressive culture in Texas offers a valuable opportunity to analyze the evolution of women's voluntary associations, their challenges to southern conventions of race and class, and their quest for social change and political power. Judith McArthur makes an important and accessible contribution to the study of women's activism by tracing in detail how general concerns of national progressive organizations - about pure food, prostitution, and education reform - shaped programs at state and local levels. Southern women differed from their northern counterparts by devising new approaches to settlement work and taking advantage of World War I to challenge southern gender and racial norms. McArthur offers a unique analysis of how women in Texas succeeded in securing partial voting rights before passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Throughout her study, McArthur provides valuable comparisons between North and South, among various southern states, and between black and white, male and female progressives."
Regulation In The White House: The Johnson Presidency,"['Welborn, David M. , 1934-']","Regulation was entering a transition phase during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. He and his advisors explored the idea of deregulation in the economic sphere, while offering specific proposals for expanded social regulation to protect consumer, environmental, and health and safety interests. Regulation in the White House is the first general study of regulatory policy and its development in the Johnson administration and the first comprehensive study of any presidency and regulation. Based upon a thorough analysis of presidential papers in the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, the book investigates the working relationships linking the presidency, regulatory commissions, and executive agencies with regulatory responsibilities in both the economic and social spheres. David Welborn finds that the president's business included regulation as a major component. Johnson's concerns in regulation were complex, but most important were fulfilling his duties as chief executive and encouraging regulation that would be perceived as reasonable, judicious, and transcendent of narrow special interests. He and his aides worked assiduously and with considerable success to establish effective, cooperative working relationships with regulators and to avoid the exercise of undue influence on particular regulatory determinations. In Welborn's view, Johnson traversed the treacherous ground of regulatory politics with adeptness and successfully realized his major purposes in regulation. David M. Welborn is a professor of political science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville."

Richard Rodgers,['Geoffrey Holden Block'],"Richard Rodgers was an icon of the musical theater, a prolific composer whose career spanned six decades and who wrote more than a thousand songs and forty shows for the American stage. In this absorbing book, Geoffrey Block examines Rodgers's entire career, providing rich details about the creation, staging, and critical reception of some of his most popular musicals. Block traces Rodgers's musical education, early work, and the development of his musical and dramatic language. He focuses on two shows by Rodgers and Hart (A Connecticut Yankee and The Boys from Syracuse) and two by Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific and Cinderella), offering new insights into each one. He concludes with the first serious look at the five neglected and often maligned musicals that Rodgers composed in the 1960s and 1970s, after the death of Hammerstein.""Geoffrey Block's book is perceptive, stimulating, sometimes provocative, and always interesting. By setting out to examine Rodgers's work rather than his somewhat dismal life, the author not only concentrates upon what is important about Rodgers but offers example after example of the composer's methods, enabling even the most musically unsophisticated reader to appreciate the subtleties of his work.""-Frederick Nolan, author of Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway

The Adventures Of Roberto Rossellini: His Life And Film,['Tag Gallagher'],"Roberto Rossellini (19061977)—movie-maker, bon vivant, and passionate intellectual—was the key figure of Italian neo-realism, the godfather of the French New Wave, and a television pioneer; the maker of such classics as <i>Open City, Paisan, Stromboli, Flowers of St. Francis, Voyage in Italy,</i> and <i>Louis XIV;</i> Anna Magnani's lover; Ingrid Bergman's husband; and Isabella Rossellini's father. Continually enmeshed in controversy, perhaps no other figure in the history of world cinema has been so reviled—and so revered. Tag Gallagher's masterful biography of Rossellini, the first in any language, was fifteen years in the making. It is the result of assiduous research, lengthy interviews with almost everyone who knew him, and investigations into the making and reception of his films. The cast of characters includes Vittorio Mussolini, Il Duce's son and Rossellini's Fascist-era producer; Howard Hughes, who produced <i>Stromboli</i> and then, in a fit of jealousy over Ingrid Bergman, butchered its American release; and dozens of other people. Combining a portrait of a dynamic and daring man with brilliant discussions of his work, Tag Gallagher tells a story as rich and moving as Rossellini's miraculous films."

Across the Moscow River: The World Turned Upside Down,['Rodric Braithwaite'],"Rodric Braithwaite was British ambassador to Moscow during the critical years of Perestroika and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the failed coup of August 1991, and the rise of Boris Yeltsin. From the vantage point of the British Embassy (once the mansion of the great nineteenth-century merchant Pavel Kharitonenko) with its commanding views across the Moscow River to Red Square and the Kremlin, Braithwaite had a ringside seat. With his long experience of Russia and the Russians, who saw him as 'Mrs Thatcher's Ambassador', on good personal terms with Mikhail Gorbachev, he was in a privileged position close to the centre of Russia's changing relationship with the West.<p>But this is not primarily a memoir. It is an intimate analysis of momentous change and the people who drove it, against the background of Russia's long history and its unique but essentially European culture. Braithwaite watched as Gorbachev and his allies struggled to modernise and democratise a system which had already reached the point of terminal decay. Against the opposition of the generals, they forced the abandonment of the nuclear confrontation as the Soviet Union fell apart. The climax of the drama came in August 1991 when a miscellaneous collection of conservative patriots -- generals, politicians and secret policemen -- attempted to reverse the course of history and succeeded only in accelerating the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p> Braithwaite left Moscow with Russia at its lowest ebb, grappling with the problems of an unfamiliar market economy on its uncertain path towards becoming a modern liberal state. Written with vigour, frankness and hope, and with a considerable feel for atmosphere and tension, this is a revealing and compassionate account of one of the twentieth century's most dramatic reversals of fortune.</p>"
Indian Giver,"['Duff, Gerald.']","Sam Houston Leaping Deer follows in a long tradition of American heroes—from Huckleberry Finn to Holden Caulfield—individuals who struggle against a frequently hostile society for psychological survival, for integrity, and for authenticity. Sam is an Alabama-Coushatta Indian trapped between his Indian heritage and white America. Sam is a talented basketball player. He is the best pure shooter ever to come off the reservation. Putting a basketball through a hoop is for him a mystical, even metaphysical event. His skill takes him from a small Texas town and the reservation to the University of Illinois basketball team, where he immediately becomes a star. Along the way he meets a cross section of characters and personalites that his reservation life has not trained him to cope with. His life seems increasingly empty compared to his memories of the Alabama-Coushatta legends. In what might have become a cliche in the hands of a lesser writer, Gerald Duff delivers a powerful work of satire, humor, and tragedy."

The Degaev Affair: Terror And Treason In Tsarist Russia,['Richard Pipes'],"Sergei Degaev (1857-1921), a leading political terrorist in tsarist Russia, disappeared after participating in the assassination of the chief of Russia's security organization in 1883. Those who later knew and admired the quietly learned mathematics professor Alexander Pell at the University of South Dakota never guessed this was actually Degaev, who had triple-crossed friends and associates while entangled in the revolutionary movement of his homeland. This book is the first in any language to tell in extensive detail the extraordinary story of one of the world's most intriguing revolutionaries, his role in building and betraying the earliest political terrorist network, and his subsequent conventional academic career in America. Richard Pipes, a leading historian of the Russian Revolution, uses previously unexplored Russian archives to draw a brilliant psychological, political, and sociological portrait of Degaev. Pipes pursues his protagonist on a twisting journey that begins with Degaev's participation in the original Russian terrorist organization, the People's Will, and his rise in the group as others were arrested. Degaev himself was soon imprisoned, but by turning police informant and betraying those he knew in the revolutionary movement, he negotiated his own release. When later he confessed his duplicity, he avoided execution at the hands of revolutionaries by helping to murder the head of the tsar's secret police, Colonel Georgii Sudeikin, following which he escaped to the United States to begin a new life with a new identity. An intricate tale of changing loyalties, fateful collaborations, and a man whose double life can only be described as amazing, The Degaev Affair places the history and nature of political terrorism in Russia in an absorbing new perspective."
Sexual Politics,['Kate Millett'],"Sexual Politics laid the foundation for subsequent feminist scholarship by showing how cultural discourse reflects a systematized subjugation and exploitation of women. Millett demonstrates in detail how patriarchy's attitudes and systems penetrate literature, philosophy, psychology, and politics. Her incendiary work rocked the foundations of the literary canon by castigating time-honored classics - from D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover to Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead - for their use of sex to degrade and undermine women."" ""A new introduction to this edition draws attention to some of the forms patriarchy has taken recently in consolidating its oppressive and dangerous control."
George Gershwin,['Merle Armitage'],"Shortly after George Gershwin's premature death in 1937, Merle Armitage invited Gershwin's friends and associates to contribute memories and tributes for this volume, which was first published in 1938. Few figures have lent themselves so aptly to composite treatment as did the versatile Gershwin. In these 38 articles, a remarkable range of interests are covered, comprising a warm and glowing portrait of an extraordinary musician who exerted an unparalleled influence on his era."

Wildlife Research And Management In The National Parks,['R. Gerald Wright'],"Should the wolf be reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park? Should hunting of ""overabundant"" deer and elk be permitted in some parks? How should grizzly bears be managed in frequently visited areas? Are mountain goats to be eliminated from Olympic National Park? R. Gerald Wright probes these and other issues of public interest in this exploration of the unique role national parks have played in the protection, study, and management of animal life. Controversy has often surrounded wildlife management, primarily when societal attitudes toward specific animals do not mesh with Park Service practices. Those practices are influenced by the public as well as by the evolution of a program of scientific study in the national parks. As park environments are increasingly threatened by growing numbers of visitors, outside land-use changes, and pollution, it is more important than ever that scientific knowledge, administrative willingness, and public support combine to help create the policies necessary for appropriate management and protection of park resources. Wright traces the history of wildlife management in the U.S. national parks, bringing together a diversity of literature and previously unpublished information that will be of concern to wildlife and land-management specialists, conservationists, and all those interested in our national parks."
Origins Of Pre-columbian Art (the Texas Pan American Series) (pan America Series),['Terence Grieder'],"Since Columbus first called the natives of the Americas “Indians,” the sources of their art and culture have been a puzzle. The strange mixture of objects of Asian appearance with those decidedly un-Asian has provided fuel for controversy between those who see the American cultures as products of diffusion and those who see them as independent inventions. Origins of Pre-Columbian Art cuts through this old dispute to provide a fresh look at ancient cultural history in the Americas and the Pacific basin.<br>
 Using evidence from archaeology, ethnology, and psychology, Terence Grieder suggests that contact between individuals across cultural borders is the root of both invention and diffusion. By tracing the spread of early symbolic techniques, materials, and designs from Europe and Asia to the lands of the Pacific and to the Americas, he displays the threads woven through humanity’s common cultural heritage.<br>
 While archaeology provides examples of ancient symbols, ethnology reveals widely separated modern peoples still using these symbols and giving them similar meanings. Mapping these patterns of use and meaning, the author describes three waves of migration from Asia to the Americas, each carrying its own cluster of ideas and the symbols that expressed them.<br>
 First Wave cultures focused on their environment and on the human body, inventing symbols that compared people and nature. Second Wave symbolism emphasized the center and the periphery: the village and the horizon; the tree or pole as world axis; and the world’s rim, where spirits exist. These cultures created masks to give form to those beings beyond the horizon. The heavens were finally incorporated into the system of symbols by Third Wave peoples, who named the celestial bodies as gods, treasured heaven-colored stones, and represented the world in pyramids.<br>
 Emphasizing the interpretation of art in its many forms, Grieder has found that such seemingly minor decorations as bark cloth clothing and tattoos have deep meaning. Ancient art, he argues, was the vehicle for ancient science, serving to express insights into biology, astronomy, and the natural world.<br>"

Peppers: The Domesticated Capsicums,['Jean Andrews'],"Since its original publication in 1984, Peppers has become the complete and classic source for the history and dispersion, biology and taxonomy, cultivation, and medicinal, economic, and gastronomic uses of the domesticated capsicum. In this new edition, Jean Andrews updates each section with new material gathered over the last ten years. Particularly interesting are her descriptions of recent medicinal uses of peppers (including a recipe for pain-relieving capsaicin cream) and the inclusion of two additional cultivars, Datil and Scotch Bonnet. Like the first edition, this volume is illustrated with botanically accurate, yet aesthetically pleasing paintings that show the blossoms, buds, young peppers, and mature specimens of 34 cultivars in full color. Dr. Andrews also provides a recipe for the most typical dish in which each pepper is used, recipes that she herself has tested and served to grateful friends."
"Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, And Tyrant","['Fuller, J. F. C. (john Frederick Charles) , 1878-1966']","Since the Renaissance, Julius Caesar has been idolized as a superman. Classical sources, however, present a far less exalted being. As General Fuller writes, Caesar was ""an unscrupulous demagogue whose one aim was power, and a general who could not only win brilliant victories but also commit dismal blunders.... It is reasonable to suspect that, at times, Caesar was not responsible for his actions, and toward the end of his life, not altogether sane."" There is not doubt that Caesar was an extraordinary man.” But Fuller points out that he was extraordinary for his reckless ambition, matchless daring, and ruthless tyranny, rather than for his skills as a military comander. Caesar continually had to extricate himself from results of mistakes of judgement. His unnecessary Alexandrian War, his close call at Thapsus, and his seemingly unpremeditated Gallic conquest are just a few of Fuller's many examples.And in telling Caesar's history, Fuller illuminates a century of Roman history as well. Aided by maps of Caesar's principal battles and diagrams of many of his weapons, Fuller brings to life Caesar's wars, his armies, his equipment, and his methods. Brilliant in design and impressive in scope, <i>Julius Caesar</i> clarifies how the military, political, and economic aspects of the Roman Republic worked together to produce a man whose name has come down to us as a synonym for absolute authority."
"Army Surveillance in America, 1775-1980",['Joan M. Jensen'],"Since the Revolution, Americans have debated what action the military should take toward civilians suspected of espionage, treason, or revolutionary activity. This important book-the first to present a comprehensive history of military surveillance in the United States-traces the evolution of America's internal security policy during the past two hundred years. <p>Joan M. Jensen discusses how the federal government has used the army to intervene in domestic crises and how Americans have protested the violation of civil liberties and applied political pressure to limit military intervention in civil disputes. Although movements to expand and to constrain the military have each dominated during different periods in American history, says Jensen, the involvement of the army in internal security has increased steadily. Jensen describes a wide range of events and individuals connected to this process. These include Benedict Arnold's betrayal of West Point; the colonial wars in Cuba, where Lt. Andrew Rowan, the nation's first officer spy, won a medal for carrying a Message for Garcia; the development of War Plans White in the 1920s to guide the army's response in the event of domestic rebellion; the activities of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI in the 1950s and 1960s; the use of the National Guard in the South at the height of the civil rights movement; and the surveillance of and violence against protesters during the Vietnam War. Scrutinizing the historic workings of the American government at closer range than has ever been done before, Jensen creates a vivid picture of the growing invisible intelligence empire within the United States government and of the men who created it.</p>"
Global E-commerce Strategies For Small Business,['Eduardo Da Costa'],"Small companies account for a surprising one-third of U.S. exports, and their market share is growing. The Internet has played a major role in helping these companies develop an increasingly powerful international presence. Global E-Commerce Strategies for Small Businesses describes the export opportunities e-commerce holds for small-to-medium size enterprises (SMEs) all over the world. The book is organized in two parts. The first uses examples and case studies of small exporting companies from six countries to show how SMEs and new entrepreneurs are not only successful but also often responsible for job creation, innovation, and economic growth in their regions. It also examines common obstacles to exports such as local and international laws, cultural differences, trade barriers, taxation, and transport infrastructure. The second part covers the steps in setting up a global business: researching business opportunities, identifying and reach out to customers, building and keeping an online image, closing the deal, and maintaining customer support. Written in a casual, accessible style, the book offers an overview of the tools and services available to help smaller companies flourish in the global marketplace."
India: Facing The Twenty-first Century (the Essential Asia),['Barbara Crossette'],"Sometime early in the twenty-first century India will overtake China as the most populous nation in the world. For all its size and importance, India is a relatively unknown nation to the rest of the world, trapped in its own self-absorption, suspicious of the outside world, unwilling to interact as a nation among nations. Torn by racial violence and conflict, impoverished, ardent, mystical, religious, exciting, dangerous, and powerful - India is all of these things and more. Barbara Crossette gives us a brilliant short introduction to the world's largest democracy. In Part I, she looks at the inner self and tries to draw some general conclusions for the uninitiated on the nature of Indian myth and psychology. Part II deals with daily realities - the violence of contemporary Indian society, problems of ethnicity, caste, and religion, the plight of children, bureaucracy in sports, the darshan effect, and the growing power of the secular middle class. Part III treats politics: the problems of political history and self-definition, India and its neighbors, and the relationship between the United States and India. An afterword looks, tenuously and tentatively, toward India's hope for the future."
Launching democracy in South Africa,['R. W. Johnson &  Lawrence Schlemmer'],"South Africa's first ever non-racial and multi-party election was perhaps the most significant global event of 1994. From the ashes of a repressive, segregated and racist state emerged - miraculously and relatively free from bloodshed - a new, multi-racial nation, led by one of the political icons of the late twentieth century, Nelson Mandela. Based on a large-scale and non-partisan public information project, this book is the definitive account of the process of democratisation in South Africa. The Launching Democracy project mounted teams of observers and monitored the campaign, party organisation, the media and voter education efforts throughout the crucial and populous areas of the Western Cape, Natal and the Reef. The result is an unparalleled source of information about the way the election really worked and the political sociology of South Africa in general. Written by a team of distinguished experts, the book analyses the results of the election in detail (and publishes them in full for the first time). It examines the intricacies of the disputed electoral process and the drama of the count, revealing irregularities, rivalry and widespread fear and intimidation. In a highly readable final section, the book carries the story into the post-election reality, exploring popular opinion and the demands now facing the Mandela government."

The State And Human Services: Organizational Change In A Political Context (mit Studies In American Politics And Public Policy ; 7),['Laurence E. Lynn'],"State human services agencies are frequently criticized by state executives, legislators, and service recipients who contend that reorganization will improve performance and efficiency. This study points out, however, that the proponents and architects of change commonly fail to recognize the extent to which reorganizing a state agency is a political rather than an administrative or managerial act and that many pitfalls await them. The book asserts that if reorganization is to improve state agency performance, rather than ending as it so often does in disappointment and frustration, the political context must be carefully analyzed and proposals designed accordingly.
<p><i>The State and Human Services</i> addresses this vital problem by examining the reorganization of human services in Arizona, Florida, Georgia (by then-governor Jimmy Carter), Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Washington. It shows how the human services departments in these six states have been shaped by and interact with their political environment. The book focuses on the originators of change and their goals, on the processes of debate and deliberation, and on the results. It concludes that reorganization is a grueling test of political and administrative competence and should not be undertaken unless the initiators have the time, resources, and determination to see it through.</p>
<p><i>The State and Human Services</i> covers timely and important issues of central concern to teachers and practitioners in federal, state, and local politics, public policy, and human services administration. The comparative case material is unique—containing a wealth of insights into human service policy and the actions and motivations of governors, legislatures, administrators, and human service professionals. The book explains much about the implications of a ""new federalism"" and about the complicated relationships among levels of government. In addition, it illuminates the neglected subject of the role of managers and management in state government.</p>
<p><i>The State and Human Services</i> is the seventh volume in the series MIT Press Studies in American Politics and Public Policy.</p>"
A New Guide To Federal Cable Television Regulations,['Steven R. Rivkin'],"Steven Rivkin's widely read <i>Cable Television: A Guide to Federal Regulations</i> was written in 1972 and was originally published by the Rand Corporation. It appeared soon after the Federal Communications Commission (following five years' deliberation) had issued its comprehensive regulations regarding cable television, and the book undertook to explain the ""intended, likely"" meaning of the complex of rules and regulations with which cable television systems were required to be in compliance.
<p><i>A New Guide to Federal Cable Television Regulations</i> revisits and updates the subject, now that some five years of elaboration and ""fine-tuning"" in government controls have elapsed. Rivkin examines how these rules and regulations have fared in actual practice and he details the subsequent changes that have been made in them as a result of citizen and industry feedback over the period. He has made full use of the thousands of certifications granted by the FCC and a like number of interpretive proceedings it has held to resolve and refine disputed and ambiguous points.</p>
<p>A significant feature of the new book is the material it contains on the expected impact of the new copyright law pertinent to cable television that becomes effective January 1, 1978.</p>
<p>In outlining the purpose and structure of his book, the author writes: ""Whatever the merit of the FCC's accomplishments, the record of Federal regulation of cable television during the past five years has become a subject worthy of objective study and analysis, whether as a basis for prescribing some future change, as a case study of regulatory triumph, tragedy, or mediocrity (take your pick), or merely to enable the many interests affected by regulation to cope with the volume of particular details spawned by regulation. Whatever the reader's purpose, making such up-to-date wisdom available to whoever wishes to use it is the aim of this book.</p>
<p>""As in the earlier volume, that ecumenical aim dictates the format of this book. The presentation will seek to attain objectivity, by both articulating the FCC's regulatory posture and identifying unresolved issues known or suspected to exist. Moreover, this book will again attempt to be practically helpful to users however far they may be from the umbilical center of regulation in Washington, D.C. by including in a single sourcebook all key reference materials and forms. (The rules themselves, as in effect in mid-1977, are reproduced as they relate to this commentary, throughout the book, and other useful and exemplary material is contained in the Appendix, complementing the expository sections of the book.) The plan of the book—presenting a summary overview for the general reader in the first chapter, with detailed exploration of particular rules in the ensuing topical chapters—aims to make sense to readers of various orientations, interests, and professional backgrounds who must develop and maintain a working grasp of Federal cable television regulation.""</p>

High Concept: Movies And Marketing In Hollywood,"['Wyatt, Justin , 1963-']","Steven Spielberg once said, ""I like ideas, especially movie ideas, that you can hold in your hand. If a person can tell me the idea in twenty-five words or less, it's going to make a pretty good movie."" Spielberg's comment embodies the essence of the high concept film, which can be condensed into one simple sentence that inspires marketing campaigns, lures audiences, and separates success from failure at the box office.
<p>This pioneering study explores the development and dominance of the high concept movie within commercial Hollywood filmmaking since the late 1970s. Justin Wyatt describes how box office success, always important in Hollywood, became paramount in the era in which major film studios passed into the hands of media conglomerates concerned more with the economics of filmmaking than aesthetics. In particular, he shows how high concept films became fully integrated with their marketing, so that a single phrase (""Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water . . ."") could sell the movie to studio executives and provide copy for massive advertising campaigns; a single image or a theme song could instantly remind potential audience members of the movie, and tie-in merchandise could generate millions of dollars in additional income.</p>"
Studying the Jewish future,"['Goldscheider, Calvin.']","Studying the Jewish Future explores the power of Jewish culture and assesses the perceived threats to the coherence and size of Jewish communities in the United States, Europe, and Israel. In an unconventional and provocative argument, Calvin Goldscheider departs from the limiting vision of the demographic projections that have shaped predictions about the health and future of Jewish communities and asserts that ""the quality of Jewish life has become the key to the future of Jewish communities.""<br>
<p>Through the lens of individual biographies, Goldscheider shows how context shapes Jewish senses of the future and how conceptions of the future are shaped and altered by life experiences. Goldscheiders distinctive comparative approach includes a critical review of population issues, a consideration of biographies as a basis for understanding Jewish values, and an analysis of biblical texts for studying contemporary values. He combines demographic and sociological analyses in historical and comparative perspectives to dispel the notion that quantitative issues are at the heart of the challenge of Jewish continuity in the future.<br>
</p>
<p>Numbers are clearly the building blocks of community. But the interpretations of these demographic issues are often confusing and biased by ideological preconceptions. As a basis for studying the core themes of the Jewish future, hard facts are less hard and less ""factual"" than interpreters have made them out to be. Population projections are limited by the vision of those who prepare them.<br>
</p>
<p>Goldscheider concludes that the futures of Jewish communities-in America, Europe, and Israel-are much more secure than has been presented in most scholarly and popular publications, and discussions about the Jewish future should shift to other patterns of distinctiveness.<br>
</p>
<p>This book will appeal to the general Jewish reader as well as to social scientists and modern Jewish historians. It is appropriate for Jewish studies courses, particularly, but not exclusively, those focusing on Jews in the United States, the American Jewish community, and modern Jewish society, and in courses on ethnicity, multiculturalism, cultural diversity, and ethnic relations.<br>

I used to be nice,"[""O'Sullivan"", 'Sue']","Sue O'Sullivan's collection of writing charts a quarter century of feminist engagement: from her ambilvalence towards motherhood and marriage in the 1960s and 70s to butch/femme and queer in the 1980s and 90s; from birth control and PMT to HIV/AIDS and eroticism. Teasing out the contradictory layers which make up lesbian chic, political correctness and transsexuality. O'Sullivan moves on to take sides in the continuing debates around pornography and censorship. 'I use to be nice' is a sentiment shared by many feminists who don't fit any of the tired old stereotypes, but for whom the experience of injustice, anger and joy, has provided the foundation for a different sort of feminist identity. Sue O'Sullivan's feisty ands inclusive analysis of key ideas and events embraces diversity and holds on to integrity. Reflective and astute, I Used to be Nice offers the reader convincing insights into the affairs and battles that have characterized twenty-five years of feminist and lesbian politics internationally."

The New International Economic Order,['JN BHAGWATI'],"The ""north-south debate"" between and within the developed and developing countries on achieving international distributive economic justice has emerged as one of the focal issues of world security and peace. The world economic order is changing, like it or not. Most discussions on the subject are distressingly uninformative, either giving blanket superficial endorsements to the demands of less developed countries or, equally superficially, condemning them out of hand. By contrast, this collection of more than a dozen articles, growing out of a workshop held at MIT in May 1975, is a real attempt to come to grips with the issues. Taken as a whole, the volume provides detailed and systematic reviews of the past history of the issues, their current status, future prospects, and economic desirability. Specific proposals are analyzed in depth, and with rigor and imagination, but without falling back on jargon or complicated mathematics.
<p>Professor Bhagwati sets the stage with an overview of the underlying political and economic factors. In the rest of the book developmental problems are covered under four headings. Section one, on resource transfers, offers essays on economic aid, income distribution, debt relief, and taxing the ""brain drain."" Richard Cooper discusses oceans as a source of revenue. Section two, on international trade, includes Professor Bhagwati's essay on market disruption, and C. Fred Bergsten's proposals on access to supply. Others treat trade policies and commodities. Section three, on world food problems, deals with the stability of grain in D. Gale Johnson's paper and food aid in Alexander H. Sarris's and Lance Taylor's article. Section four, on technology transfer, evaluates multinationals and direct foreign investment.

James M. Cain And The American Authors' Authority (american Studies Series),['Richard Fine'],"The 1940s offered ever-increasing outlets for writers in book publishing, magazines, radio, film, and the nascent television industry, but the standard rights arrangements often prevented writers from collecting a fair share of the profits made from their work. To remedy this situation, novelist and screenwriter James M. Cain (The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce) proposed that all professional writers, including novelists, playwrights, poets, and screenwriters, should organize into a single cartel that would secure a fairer return on their work from publishers and producers. This organization, conceived and rejected within one turbulent year (1946), was the American Authors' Authority (AAA). In this groundbreaking work, Richard Fine traces the history of the AAA within the cultural context of the 1940s. After discussing the profession of authorship as it had developed in England and the United States, Fine describes how the AAA, which was to be a central copyright repository, was designed to improve the bargaining position of writers in the literary marketplace, keep track of all rights and royalty arrangements, protect writers' interests in the courts, and lobby for more favorable copyright and tax legislation. Although simple enough in its design, the AAA proposal ignited a firestorm of controversy, and a major part of Fine's study explores its impact in literary and political circles. Among writers, the AAA exacerbated a split between East and West Coast writers, who disagreed over whether writing should be treated as a money-making business or as an artistic (and poorly paid) calling. Among politicians, a move to unite all writers into a single organization smacked of communism and sowed seeds of distrust that later flowered in the Hollywood blacklists of the McCarthy era. Drawing insights from the fields of American studies, literature, and Cold War history, Fine's book offers a comprehensive picture of the development of the m"

The African Heritage Of American English,"['Holloway, Joseph E.']","The African Heritage of American English provides a detailed compilation of Africanisms, identified linguistically, from a range of sources: folklore, place names, food culture, aesthetics, religion, loan words. Presenting a comprehensive accounting of African words retained from Bantu, Joseph Holloway and Winifred Vass examine the Bantu vocabulary content of the Gullah dialect of the Sea Islands; Black names in the United States; Africanisms of Bantu origin in Black English; Bantu place names in nine southern states; and Africanisms in contemporary American English. These linguistic retentions reflect the cultural patterns of groups imported to the United States, the subsequent dispersion of these groups, and their continuing influence on the shaping of American culture."

"Images Of Sephardi And Eastern Jewries In Transition: The Teachers Of The Alliance Israelite Universelle, 1860-1939",['Aron Rodrigue'],"The Alliance Israelite Universelle, an organization founded in Paris in 1860, established a vast network of schools in Sephardi and Eastern Jewish communities in Muslim lands stretching from Morocco in the west to Iran in the east. Teachers were recruited locally from among the best students at these schools, trained in Paris, and sent to teach in and direct other Alliance schools. In this book Aron Rodrigue examines the ideology and activities of the organization and discusses its place in modern Jewish history. His primary source is the correspondence between the teachers and the Alliance Central Committee in Paris. The book includes a generous selection of letters, along with reports, directives, and policy guidelines, thematically arranged and analyzed. The teachers not only discuss school matters but paint a distinctive picture of Jewish communities in Muslim lands, commenting on their social structures, customs, relationships with non-Jewish populations and authorities, and the changes caused by political, social, and economic developments. The image created within the representational framework of the letters is one that is often highly critical of the communities in which the teachers found themselves, reflecting the latter's identification with the values of French Jewry and the Alliance. Imbued with the liberal ideals of the age and guided by the Franco-Jewish ideology of emancipation, the Alliance sought to gain equal rights and full citizenship for Jews in every country, to defend Jews from persecution, and, through education, to modernize and westernize non-European Jewish communities. Its activities contributed greatly to the fundamental cultural, social, and political reorientation of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries toward the West in the modern period. The work of the Alliance was intimately associated with the process of westernization that marked so decisively the history of Jewish communities in the last century of their existence in Muslim land"
"The Education Of The Architect: Historiography, Urbanism, And The Growth Of Architectural Knowledge",['The Mit Press'],"The authors of these eighteen essays have all been deeply influenced by the philosophy of architecture developed by Stanford Anderson, through his writings and through the teaching program of the Department of History, Theory and Criticism of Architecture, which he and Henry Millon founded at MIT over twenty years ago. This ""school"" of architectural thought views architecture as a world of inquiry and as a discipline anchored in the epistemological bases of contemporary philosophy, especially the philosophy of science.
<p>Clear thematic concerns bind the essays together. The essays of the first section, ""American Debates,"" share a deep preoccupation with modernism, its national ideologies, and regional responses in the American context. The contributors to the second section, ""European Responses,"" examine European responses to these American debates. In the third section, ""Historiographic Constructs,"" contributors comment on the writing, interpretation, and uses of architectural history. Contributors to the fourth section, ""Urbanisms,"" grapple with the knotty interdependence of politics and the built environment. In the last section, ""Teaching Architecture,"" four distinguished educators consider the most difficult aspect of the discipline, its pedagogical mandate. Whether historians or architects (and several have trained in both areas), the essayists all share the belief that contemporary concerns about architecture affect the way history is constructed. Because they view architecture as a body of knowledge evolving over time, they have resisted the wholesale espousal or rejection of modernism that has often polarized the examination and practice of architecture in the second half of this century.</p>

Man From Babel (henry Mcbride Series In Modernism And Modernity),['Eugene Jolas'],"The autobiography of Eugene Jolas, available for the first time nearly half a century after his death in 1952, is the story of a man who, as the editor of the expatriate American literary magazine <i>Transition</i>, was the first publisher of James Joyce's <i>Finnegans Wake</i> and other signal works of the modernist period. Jolas' memoir provides often comical and compelling details about such leading modernist figures as Joyce, Stein, Hemingway, Breton, and Gide, and about the political, aesthetic, and social concerns of the Surrealists, the Expressionists, and other literary figures during the 1920s and 1930s. <i>Man from Babel</i> both enriches and challenges our view of international modernism and the historical avant-garde."
Renaissance Self-portraiture: The Visual Construction Of Identity And The Social Status Of The Artist,"['Woods-marsden, Joanna , 1936-']","The autonomous self-portrait, a central mode of expression in western art, was a Renaissance invention. This book explores for the first time the genesis and early development of this important genre as it took place in Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Joanna Woods-Marsden examines a series of self-portraits in Renaissance Italy and their relation to the social status of art and artists. She argues that these self-images represented the aspirations of their creators to change the status of art and thereby their own social standing."
Gas tanks,"['Becher', 'Bernd', 'Hilla']","The Bechers' industrial vision has become an essential part of the way we see today; their head-on, deadpan photographs of pithead gear and water towers and blast furnaces have for more than 30 years expressed a serenely cool, rigorous approach that reduces the individual structures they photograph to variations on an ideal form. In this, their latest work, the Bechers' present four principally different forms of gas holders or gas tanks in 140 photographs taken during the years 1963-1992 in Great Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, and the United States.<p>The subjects are photographed under overcast skies that eliminate expressive variations in lighting; the Bechers make no attempt to analyze or explain them. Captions contain only the barest of information: time and place. On the subject of gas holders, the Bechers limit their remarks to a minimal functional description, leaving the esthetic dimension of their subject to the photographs themselves: much of the fascination of these photographs lies in the fact that these unadorned metallic structures, presumably built with little concern for their visual impact, are almost invariably striking in appearance.</p><p>Bernd and Hilla Becher teach at the DÃ¼sseldorf Art Academy. They began their collaborative photographic enterprise in 1957, when they did a study of workers' houses in their native Germany. The Bechers follow in a distinguished line of German photographers that includes August Sander, Albert Renger-Patzsch, and Werner Manz, all of whom contributed in different ways to the definition of objective photography.</p>"

After the City,['Lars Lerup'],"The city's reign over our senses, our moods, our very ways of being is outmoded. The suburban metropolis has superseded the city. The new building materials are nonmaterial: electricity, telephony, weather, time, and so forth. Consequently, according to Lars Lerup, architecture and the architectural profession must be rethought.<p>Until now, architects have been trained to serve the elite few, as reflected in a belief in customization and the uniqueness of each project. Instead, Lerup holds, architectural educators should promote teamwork and the design of authorless objects, combined with an integration of design and practice. Before we can rethink the architectural curriculum, however, we must rethink the metropolis.</p><p>And rethink the metropolis is just what Lerup does. In an intellectually far-ranging yet intensely personal manner, he moves from contemplation of the form and philosophical implications of the Pantheon to a discussion of how Levittown residents seek and create community. The result is an exhilarating work with profound practical implications. Unlike the many who view suburbia with paranoid dismay, Lerup takes an optimistic view of the new, open metropolis--for him not the site of unavoidable uniformity and mediocrity, but an exciting new frontier.</p><p> Lars Lerup is the Harry K. and Albert K. Smith Professor in Architecture and Dean at Rice University.</p>"

Orthogonal Town Planning In Antiquity,['Ferdinando Castagnoli'],"The decisiveness of the right angle, which is uncommon in nature, would seem to exercise an irresistible appeal to the human mind, for it permeates man's art, artifacts, and architecture. That it should also appear as a basic organizing element in town plans over many centuries and in many cultures only confirms this appeal. The present work examines Greek, Etruscan, Italic, Hellenistic, and Roman cities that were based on orthogonal or grid plans—those characterized by streets intersecting at right angles to form blocks of regular size and spacing. Some of these have only recently been uncovered.
<p>The author suggests that the implementation of these plans may have constituted the first exercise in master planning for the future extension and development of cities. These goals doubtless varied in ancient times from the tyrannical—suggesting an authoritarian control with the power to order a population into a strict grid pattern—to the egalitarian—implicit in the essential uniformity and equality of the blocks regardless of location.</p>
<p>In Roman times the orthogonal plan was to evolve into a quadrant system in which two broad streets at right angles served as the defining axes of the town, meeting to form a formal central space, the ""origin"" of the coordinated city. These plans are discussed in the book, but the major emphasis is on ""Hippodamean"" layouts, in which a few—usually three or four—main parallel roads are intersected at right angles by numerous narrow streets to form long, narrow blocks.</p>
<p>Hippodamean plans are named for Hippodamus of Miletus, a Greek of the fifth century B.C. Although in antiquity Hippodamus was believed to have devised this scheme, the author points out that such plans predate Hippodamus by a considerable period, and his role was one of refining and further systematizing the plan. His chief contribution would appear to be his application of his studies of political organization and social behavior to town planning.</p>
<p>Indeed, Hippodamean plans go back at least to the seventh century B.C. in Greece, and rectangular elements basic to such plans have been found in settlements older still. Moreover, cities based on orthogonality are found not only throughout the Mediterranean region but in Aztec, Indian, and Chinese cultures as well.</p>
<p>A number of aerial photographs are juxtaposed with detailed plans prepared by archaeologists, which provide a fascinating insight into the solutions which Hippodamus and other planners evolved in the process of adjusting the needs of urban settlements to the exigencies of the terrain.</p>"
Jimmie Rodgers,"['Porterfield', 'Nolan']","The definitive biography of the ""Father of Country Music""
<p>Jimmie Rodgers (1897-1933), the first performer elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame, was a folk hero in his own lifetime and has been idolized by fans and emulated by performers ever since. His life story has been particularly susceptible to romanticizing, marked as it was by humble origins, sudden success and fame, and an early death from tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Nolan Porterfield's biography banishes the rumors and myths that have long shrouded the Blue Yodeler's life story. Unlike previous writings about Rodgers, Porterfield's book derives from extensive and detailed research into original sources: private letters, personal interviews, court records, and newspaper accounts. Jimmie Rodgers significantly expands and alters our knowledge of the entertainer's life and career, explaining the nature of his role in American culture of the Depression era and providing insightful background on the milieu in which he worked. Porterfield writes a preface for this edition.</p>

Sherwood shows how attitudes and values in the lower forty-eight states affected federal wildlife policies in Alaska."
Seismic Design In Nuclear Power Plants,['R.j. Hansen'],"The development of protective measures to guard against the spread of radioactive debris following reactor disasters has been given extensive and careful engineering attention over the past several years. Much of this attention has been devoted to eliminating or minimizing the effects of malfunctions of internal components. But reactors can also suffer externally caused disasters—for example, their radioactive cores can be damaged by earthquakes or by missiles generated by tornadoes. Earthquakes in particular will continue to render man vulnerable even to the ""peaceful atom"" as the number of nuclear power plants increases and as they come to be located in those parts of the world that have a history of seismic activity.
<p>It was to consider such problems that the seminar reported here was held. The conferees, who are leaders in this special and important field, gathered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in spring 1969, to present the papers whose titles are listed below.

"The Politics Of Change In Venezuela, Volume 3: The Illusion Of Democracy In Dependent Nations","['Frank Bonilla', 'José Silva Michelena']","The diagnosis of a national political system is put to test in Venezuela, a country that has seen a sudden and violent acceleration of structural changes over the past 40 years. This study builds on the hypothesis that such a situation creates cultural contradictions and conflicts which affect the formulation and implementation of development policies. It is based on some 5500 interviews and eight distinct types of sampling schemes with three dozen survey groups to show why democracy is permanently in crisis in an underdeveloped country.
<p>Chapter I describes the diagnostic approach used to build an analytical model of Venezuelan society. Chapter II reviews the major historical changes that have shaped present conditions, such as colonization and slavery, domination of foreign economic interests, dictatorships and student demonstrations. The remaining chapters pursue a detailed evaluation of the social groups that have influenced Venezuela's recent history, their values and experience of change. Michelena finds that while all groups have undergone a substantive positive change, social inequality has increased. An exploration of group <i>weltanshauungs</i> reveals a correlation between their socioeconomic status and political capacity. Groups with high status were found to be congenial towards development, had a firm sense of psychological autonomy, and were thus able to perceive problems and their possible solutions differently from the mass of the population. Two final syntheses using diverse methods show that Venezuelan society harbors a conservative element that frustrates attempts to distribute the benefits of change equally among social groups.</p>
<p>Following the Orwellian example and his analytical model, Michelena predicts that a revolutionary crisis may exist by 1984. He points to a series of events that are likely to occur (including possible exhaustion of oil reserves), and concludes that whether or not a crisis will develop or be resolved depends on the political ability of the social groups to manage current conflicts within a system whose real possibilities to tolerate or to make the necessary structural changes is a weak point in the functioning and organization of Venezuelan society. But, the author more hopefully indicates, there are new nationalistic attitudes and new organizations to articulate social needs—which could bring about a more adaptive, humane, and self-supporting political system.</p>
<p>This is the final report in a long-term research project aimed at formulating rational policies for the development of Venezuela. The project is a joint endeavor by members of the Centro de Estudios del Desarrollo of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (CENDES) and the Center for International Studies at M.I.T.</p>"

"Black Business In The Black Metropolis: The Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company, 1925-1985 (blacks In The Diaspo)",['Robert E Weems'],"The discriminatory lending practices of white-controlled banks often inspired pioneering Black businesses such as Chicago Met to raise operating and investment capital from less conventional sources such as gambling winnings. These companies were critical to economic development within Black communities. By providing white-collar jobs to men and women who were otherwise denied access to such opportunities, and by helping to create a Black bourgeois class and culture. Black businesses exemplified self-help ideology and nationalist inclinations in Black working-class communities of the urban North."

Microarrays For The Neurosciences: An Essential Guide,"['Daniel H. Geschwind', 'Jeffrey P. Gregg']","The effort to sequence the human genome has generated a new discipline, ""functional genomics,"" or the study of the relationship between the genetic code and its biologic potential. Gene expression studies are made possible not only by the decoding of the human genome, but by the development of new technologies. The preeminent technology in this area, DNA microarrays, is helping to revolutionize the field of neuroscience. Rather than looking at one gene at a time, researchers using DNA microarrays can monitor the expression patterns of large numbers of genes simultaneously. Bridging the traditional gap between molecular neurobiology and systems neurobiology, DNA microarray technology has the potential to elevate molecular genetic studies of the nervous system to the system level.
<p>This book provides a comprehensive guide to the use of DNA microarrays in neuroscience and provides approaches that are applicable to other complex biological systems. Human nervous system tissue is remarkably complex. The number of cell types, the architecture, the developmental program, and the importance of environmental factors in development and functioning all pose particular challenges to the researcher using gene expression studies. After an overview of the technology, the book discusses array scanning and image application, statistical methods for array analysis, specific applications of gene expression studies in the central nervous system, the use of postmortem human tissue, and novel methods for using microarray data to develop hypotheses about regulatory networks.</p>"

History Of The Yale Law School,['Anthony T. Kronman'],"The entity that became the Yale Law School started life early in the nineteenth century as a proprietary school, operated as a sideline by a couple of New Haven lawyers. The New Haven school affiliated with Yale in the 1820s, but it remained so frail that in 1845 and again in 1869 the University seriously considered closing it down. From these humble origins, the Yale Law School went on to become the most influential of American law schools. In the later nineteenth century the School instigated the multidisciplinary approach to law that has subsequently won nearly universal acceptance. In the 1930s the Yale Law School became the center of the jurisprudential movement known as legal realism, which has ever since shaped American law. In the second half of the twentieth century Yale brought the study of constitutional and international law to prominence, overcoming the emphasis on private law that had dominated American law schools. By the end of the twentieth century, Yale was widely acknowledged as the nation's leading law school. The essays in this collection trace these notable developments. The essays originated as a lecture series convened to commemorate the tercentenary of Yale University. A distinguished group of scholars assembled to explore the history of the School, from the earliest days down to modern times. This volume preserves the highly readable format of the original lectures, supported with full scholarly citations. Contributors to this volume are Robert W. Gordon, Laura Kalman, John H. Langbein, Gaddis Smith, and Robert Stevens, with an introduction by Anthony T. Kronman.

Familiar and the Unfamiliar in Twentieth-Century Architecture,['Jean LA Marche'],"The Familiar and the Unfamiliar in Twentieth-Century Architecture examines the work - written and built - of four seminal twentieth-century architects and firms: Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Aldo Rossi, and the partnership of Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. In separate chapters devoted to analyzing the early writings and architecture of each architect or firm, La Marche uncovers assumptions that each makes about the ways they expect their works to be experienced. Matching the texts the architects wrote with the buildings they were designing contemporaneously, he focuses on the language employed in discussing the subject to reveal the author-architects' distinct voices and points of view."

Beyond Spring,['Julie Landau'],"The first anthology of Sung dynasty tzu poems in English, Beyond Spring includes one hundred and fifty translations from the golden age of tzu in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. Tzu poetry is one of the two most important lyric forms in the Chinese literary tradition. First composed and performed by prostitutes in the singing houses, tzu became the favorite of emperors and high-ranking ministers who transformed it from a genre of bawdy songs to one of the lyric that could ""stay the moving clouds."" A mixture of confession and elegy, these songs remain fresh despite their thousand-year history. The genre-written in meter to the original tunes from the brothels-flourished well into the twentieth century. Beyond Spring includes best-known tzu poems by fifteen of the most celebrated poets of the period, including a king who lost his country, an emperor who lost his empire, and a woman who lost everything. Keeping true to the original music, Landau's translations capture the phrasing and rhythms crucial to tzu. Remarkably sure in her sense of what each poem is about, Landau imparts this confidence to her readers. A helpful introduction to symbols and allusions retells famous traditional stories; it equips the reader to recognize references and themes in the poems. Brief biographies of the poets, a glossary, and a historical chart of Chinese poetic genres place the poems in historical perspective. Paintings and calligraphy by the poets and their contemporaries accompany these superb translations."

Nehru: A Political Life,"['Brown, Judith M. (judith Margaret) , 1944-']","The first prime minister of India after independence from British rule, Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964) was a major architect of India as a nation state. His dedication to politics led to imprisonment under British rule, a deeply disturbed family life, and eventually to nearly two decades in power during which he ceaselessly pursued his vision of a transformed and democratic India. This compelling biography depicts the phases of Nehru's life and shows how each phase reflected new developments in Indian politics. Drawing on new sources including Nehru's post-1947 papers which have not been accessible before, Judith M. Brown offers the most complete and penetrating account of Nehru yet written. Casting new light on both the public and private Nehru, the book also provides an array of insights into the history of India's nationalist movement and international standing, and into the complexities of constructing a new nation state in the aftermath of imperial rule.""A superb book.

The Letters Of Gertrude Stein And Thornton Wilder,"['Stein, Gertrude , 1874-1946']","The friendship and correspondence of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder encompassed the last twelve years of Stein's life and a period of major work by Wilder. A generation apart in age, the two writers met during Stein's acclaimed American lecture tour in 1934-35, during which they shared the experience of lecturing to audiences in the wake of great success. They quickly became mentor and pupil as well as friends, and Wilder eloquently passed on what Stein taught him through his introductions to her books. While Wilder supported Stein's efforts at publication, she held him to his vocation as a writer, urging him to ignore the distractions incurred by family and fortune. The letters between Stein and Wilder contain ideas and plans about publications, attitudes toward fame and work, and thoughts about other artists and people near to them. They also refer to European-American cultural relations prior to and through World War II, show how Stein and Wilder responded to critical reception of their new work, and above all, examine how the two writers affected one another's progress. It is clear from the letters that without their friendship, Stein's Narration lectures would not have come about, The Geographical History and the novel Ida would have become different books, and Wilder's Our Town might not have become the play we know. The edition, fully annotated by Edward M. Burns and Ulla E. Dydo, includes a detailed chronology of Stein's lecture tour prepared by William Rice, staging histories of Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth, and an account of Stein in World War II with new documentation."
Caesar,['Theodore Ayrault Dodge'],"The Gallic campaigns firmly established Julius Caesar (100 B.C.44 B.C.) as one of the greatest commanders of all time. After success there, Caesar turned his loyal army back toward Rome. Crossing the Rubicon, he initiated a civil war, marched triumphally to the capital, besieged Pompey at Brundisium, and pacified Spain. With a tiny army he routed Pompey's far larger forces at Pharsalus, pursued him to his death in Egypt, and established Cleopatra on her throne.Though Caesar's <i>Commentaries</i> are among the most exact and picturesque of historical writings, it is only through knowledge of the geography and weaponry of his campaigns that one can properly understand them. In this history, T. A. Dodge, one of the only military historians to have visited every one of the great general's known battlefields, makes full use of other chroniclers and critics and supplements them with his clear, insightful descriptions of the battles. As a fully illustrated and complete military history of one of history's greatest generals, <i>Caesar</i> is unparalleled."

Education For The Industrial World: The écoles D'arts Et Métiers And The Rise Of French Industrial Engineering,"['Day, Charles R.']","The history of technical education in France presents an exemplary case study for the evolution of technological consciousness. This book, which examines the development of intermediate technical education in France since 1800, shows in a striking way how social conditions and technological necessity can interact to create a new class.
<p>The author reveals an expanding educational system and an emerging industrial technology combined to create patterns of intergenerational mobility that advanced thousands of Frenchmen from working-class origins into managerial careers. The system created a ""new class"" of elite technologists, despite the fact that it was designed from the start to perpetuate the hierarchical structure and stratification of French society.</p>
<p>After surveying the structure of French technical education, Day reviews the institutional history of France's oldest technical schools, the Ecoles d'Arts et Métiers, from 1800 to 1983.

Living Stones Pilgrimage: With the Christians of the Holy Land,"['Alison Hilliard', 'Betty Jane Bailey']","The Holy Land has always had a magnetic attraction for Christians. Every year, hundreds of thousands tread the crowded streets of Jerusalem, or walk by the quiet waters of Galilee. There are hundreds of guidebooks designed for pilgrims and other visitors.

The Ages Of Homer,['Edited By Jane Carter And Sarah Morris'],"The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer have fascinated listeners and readers for over twenty-five centuries. In this volume of original essays, collected to honor the distinguished teaching and research career of Emily T. Vermeule, thirty leading experts in Homeric studies and related fields provide up-to-date, multidisciplinary accounts of the most current issues in and approaches to the study of Homer. The book is divided into three sections, covering the three ""ages,"" or historical periods, of Homer. The first section treats the Bronze Age setting of the poems (around 1200 B.C.), using archaeological evidence to reveal the operation of poetic memory in preserving, distorting, and inventing the past. The second section explores the early Iron Age in which the poems were written (ca. 800-500 B.C.), using the strategies of comparative philology and mythology, literary theory, historical linguistics, anthropology, and iconography to determine how the Homeric poems took shape. The final section traces the use of Homer for literary and artistic inspiration by classical antiquity (Greece and Rome). From these essays emerge new answers to old questions such as the date of the Trojan War, the origins of the Catalogue of Ships in Book 2 of the Iliad, the historicity of early Aegean contacts with Egypt, Cyprus and the Levant, and Anatolia, and the relations between literary narrative and contemporary visual representation. In addition, several essays introduce new material relevant to Homeric studies in the form of previously unpublished works of art and new results of excavations."
"The New England Mill Village, 1790-1860 (documents In American Industrial History)","['Gary Kulik', 'Roger Parks', 'Theodore Penn']","The industrial revolution in America did not begin with billows of smoke and steam from city factories but in bucolic settings scattered about the rural landscape where textile manufacturing first took root. As Zachariah Allen writes in 1829, these textile operations were ""carried on in little hamlets, which often appear to spring up in the bosom of some forest, around the water fall which serves to turn the mill wheel."" When he wrote there were already thousands of company-owned mill villages in the northeast and by 1840 there were nearly 700 cotton mills alone in New England, most of them still in such villages close to rivers and streams.

The United States And Latin America: Myths And Stereotypes Of Civilization And Nature,['Fredrick B. Pike'],"The lazy greaser asleep under a sombrero and the avaricious gringo with money-stuffed pockets are only two of the negative stereotypes that North Americans and Latin Americans have cherished during several centuries of mutual misunderstanding. In this unique study, noted scholar Fredrick Pike probes the origins of these stereotypes and myths and explores how they have shaped North American perceptions of Latin America from the time of the Pilgrims up to the end of the twentieth century. Pike's central thesis is that North Americans have identified themselves with ""civilization"" in all its manifestations, while viewing Latin Americans as hopelessly trapped in primitivism, the victims of nature rather than its masters. He shows how this civilization-nature duality arose from the first European settlers' perception that nature - and everything identified with it, including American Indians, African slaves, all women, and all children - was something to be conquered and dominated. This myth eventually came to color the North American establishment view of both immigrants to the United States and all our neighbors to the south. Pike also acknowledges the complexity of North American society and recognizes that counterculture movements, which celebrate the natural, primitive, and instinctive, have always existed in some form. When counterculture attitudes have prevailed, as in the 1960s and 1970s, North Americans have paid more heed to the rights of the environment, of minority groups, and of women and children. A unique feature of the study is its close scrutiny of U.S. cultural currents, as manifested in literature, art, and music. In particular, Pike explores how rock-and-roll and its North American cult shed light on hemispheric relations. Pike concludes that Latin America has undergone Americanization, while the United States has in many ways been Latin Americanized. The old myths and stereotypes may never have explained very much about reality, but now they exp"
The Writings Of A Savage,['Paul Gauguin'],"The life of Paul Gauguin (18481903), who abandoned his wife, five children, and a successful career as a stockbroker to paint in poverty in exotic Tahiti, is one of the legendary tales of the art world. Today he is recognized as a highly influential founding father of modern art, who emphasized the use of flat planes and bright, nonnaturalistic color in conjunction with symbolic or primitive subjects. Familiarity with Gauguin the writer is essential for a complete understanding of the artist. <i>The Writings of a Savage</i> collects the very best of his letters, articles, books, and journals, many of which are unavailable elsewhere. In brilliantly lucid discussions of life and art Gauguin paints a triumphant self-portrait of a volcanic artist and the tormented man within."

"Heretics And Hellraisers: Women Contributors To The Masses, 1911-1917 (american Studies Series)",['Margaret C. Jones'],"The Masses was the most dynamic and influential left-wing magazine of the early twentieth century, a touchstone for understanding radical thought and social movements in the United States during that era. As a magazine that supported feminist issues, it played a crucial role in shaping public discourse about women's concerns. Women editors, fiction writers, poets, and activists like Mary Heaton Vorse, Inez Irwin, Jean Starr Untermeyer, Amy Lowell, and Mabel Dodge Luhan contributed as significantly to the magazine as better-known male figures. In this major revisionist work, Margaret C. Jones calls for reexamination of the relevance of Masses feminism to that of the 1990s. She explores women contributors' perspectives on crucial issues: patriarchy, birth control, the labor movement, woman suffrage, pacifism, and ethnicity. Jones also follows the subsequent careers of several prominent contributors - Mary Heaton Vorse, Dorothy Day, Louise Bryant, Adriana Spadoni, Elsie Clews Parsons, Inez Haynes Gillmore, and Helen Hull - to understand later developments in the radical and feminist movements and their relevance to women's issues in the 1990s. The book includes numerous examples of the writings and visual art of Masses women and a series of biographical /bibliographical sketches designed to aid other researchers. This book will be important reading for the fields of American studies, women's studies, and literary and political biography."
"Selves, People, And Persons: What Does It Mean To Be A Self?","['Rouner, Leroy S.']","The meaning of selfhood has become an urgent question, largely in reaction to the radical individualism in which many modern Western notions of selfhood have been cast. The eleven contributors to Selves, People, and Persons reshape fundamental ideas of the self in such varied fields as theology, biology, psychoanalysis, and political philosophy. Nearly all of them agree that selves are always to be understood in relation to the communities of which they are a part. The first section focuses on basic issues in the philosophy of selfhood. Erazim Kohak's title essay explores American personalism while Harold H. Oliver argues that a self is always in the act of relation to some other. Lawrence E. Cahoone counters with reflections on the limits of this social and rational notion of selfhood, and Edward W. James sketches a holistic view of the self in which the ""either/or"" of dualism can be transformed by a ""both/and."" The second group deals with selfhood in various cultures, beginning with Eliot Deutsch's exploration of how each tradition can enlarge its understanding of selfhood by incorporating elements from other traditions. John B. Carman examines the role of the self in Hindu Bhakti, and Livia Kohn explores the role of spontaneity in Chinese views of selfhood. The problem of selfhood in theology, biology, psychoanalysis, and political theory comprises the final section: Krister Stendahl discusses the idea that our selfhood is understood primarily in terms of God's selfhood; Alfred I. Tauber examines biological ideas of organism in the work of Elie Metchnikoff; John E. Mack proposes that a spiritual point of view is now required in order to fully understand the psyche; and Bhikhu Parekh examines how the issue of violence is formulated and debated in liberal democracies."
Moving Europeans: Migration in Western Europe Since 1650,['Leslie Page Moch'],"The migrations, voluntary and forced, that overran the New World following the Age of Discovery and reached their high-water mark in the years before World War I make up only part of the story of European migrations. During the same period, millions of people in Western Europe were on the move as well. Moving Europeans tells the story of these vast population movements as it examines the links between human mobility and the fundamental changes that transformed European life. Leslie Page Moch describes the changing face of Western European migration from the preindustrial era to the modern day. She focuses on the changing patterns of work, landholding, and population in rural and urban areas, placing them in the context of the social and political forces that helped to shape human migration. She looks at a broad range of issues, from gender and family practices to the regulations of nineteenth-century nation-states, and details the different experiences of men and women, of the propertied and the proletariat, as she fills in important gaps in our understanding of human mobility."

Take Charge Of Your Hospital Stay,['Karen Keating Mccann'],"The most crucial care you will receive during a stay in any hospital will come from an untrained, unpaid, unhealthy amateur: you. Today's patient is required to make vital medical, technical, and ethical decisions. When the a patient is you-or someone you care for-how can you be sure you are asking the right questions and interpreting the answers correctly? How do you know if you have chosen the right doctor, the right hospital, and the right course of treatment? What can you do to avoid unnecessary procedures or unfortunate drug interactions? Can you help contain costs without sacrificing quality? When is it appropriate to consider nontraditional medicine or experimental techniques? What should you do now to prepare for recovery.

The legacy of George Ellery Hale,"['Helen Wright', 'Joan N. Warnow', 'and  Charles Weiner']","The Mount Wilson Observatory, with its 100-inch telescope, and the Mount Palomar Observatory, with its 200-inch instrument, are monuments to the scientific leadership of George Ellery Hale (1868â1938). So central were his efforts and influence in the founding, funding, and building of these great facilities that they were jointly renamed the Hale Observatories in 1970.<p>But, as this book documents, these and other astronomical instruments are only the most visible and tangible part of Hale's legacy. More pervasive if less obvious were his efforts and influence in shaping the organization and institutions of science, its governance and financing. Perhaps as much as any one man, he brought science into the modern age of large-scale projects and team research. Directly and indirectly, numerous scientific societies, journals, research institutions, and universities bear the stamp of his felt presence, among them the National Academy of Sciences, the International Council of Scientific Unions, the International Astronomical Union, <i>The Astrophysical Journal,</i> the Carnegie Institution, and the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>This book is organized into three sections, reflecting respectively Hale's life, his own scientific interests as revealed in a selection from his papers, and his impact on his times and beyond as witnessed by colleagues and legatees at the Hale Centennial Symposium, sponsored in 1968 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><p>In the first part Helen Wright, who has published a full-length biography of Hale, deftly sketches out his life with the aid of numerous photographs, letters, newspaper accounts, and other documents.</p><p>The second part presents five of Hale's written contributions, selected to point up the range of his concerns. The first is a thesis he submitted as an M.I.T. undergraduate, in which he describes his invention, the spectroheliograph. Another, given before the Royal Institution of Great Britain, reports his major discovery, the existence of magnetic fields in sunspots. The others are Astronomical Telescopes since 1890, Elements in Technical Education, National Academies and the Progress of Research, and The Possibilities of Large Telescopes, the last from a 1928 issue of <i>Harper's Magazine.</i></p><p>The final part of the book offers perspectives from the present which indicate that Hale's legacy has been wisely used by his heirs. The contributions to the Hale Centennial Symposium that are presented here are Astronomical Telescopes since 1890, by C. Donald Shane; Astronomical Instrumentation in the Twentieth Century, by Ira S. Bowen; Research on Solar Magnetic Fields from Hale to the Present, by Robert Howard; and George Ellery Hale and Modern Scientific Institutions, by Daniel J.

Aztec And Maya Myths (legendary Past),['Karl Taube'],"The myths of the Aztec and Maya derive from a shared Mesoamerican cultural tradition. This is very much a living tradition, and many of the motifs and gods mentioned in early sources are still evoked in the lore of contemporary Mexico and Guatemala.<br>
 Professor Taube discusses the different sources for Aztec and Maya myths. The Aztec empire began less than 200 years before the Spanish conquest, and our knowledge of their mythology derives primarily from native colonial documents and manuscripts commissioned by the Spanish. The Maya mythology is far older, and our knowledge of it comes mainly from native manuscripts of the Classic period, over 600 years before the Spanish conquest.<br>
 Drawing on these sources as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century excavations and research, including the interpretation of the codices and the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing, the author discusses, among other things, the Popol Vuh myths of the Maya, the flood myth of Northern Yucatan, and the Aztec creation myths.<br>"
Roman Myths,"['Gardner, Jane F.']","The myths of the Romans are rather different from those of other ancient cultures, such as the Greeks or the Egyptians. Most Roman myths do not consist of stories about the gods and their actions, nor were they presented as fictional, magic stories. Ancient writers such as Livy, Virgil, and Ovid treated myths as history: the history of Rome itself, of its rituals and religious practices, and of important, noble Roman families. Myths were valued as exempla--illustrations of moral truths.<br>
 Many myths centered around the founding of the city of Rome, such as those of Aeneas, Romulus and Remus, and the (largely imaginary) Seven Kings. Others provided models of virtuous behavior by citizens or added luster to family histories. The protagonists were often male, but sometimes female. Lucretia, who killed herself to expunge the shame of being raped and helped precipitate the founding of the Roman Republic, was a heroine who has exercised a particular fascination on later writers and artists. Still other myths grew up around particular deities (mostly Greek) who were taken into the Roman pantheon at different times or provided ""historical"" explanations for cult activities or festivals such as Lupercalia.<br>"
Narrative And The Natural Law: An Interpretation Of Thomistic Ethics,['Pamela M. Hall'],"The Narative and the Natural Law brings Thomistic ethics into conversation with ongoing debates in contemporary moral philosophy, especially virtue theory and moral psychology, and with current trends in narrative theory and the philosophy of history. Pamela M. Hall's study offers a solid, challenging alternative to rigid, legalistic interpretations of the substantial discussions of law in Aquinas's Summa theologiae and defends Aquinas's ethics from charges of excessive legalism."
The Angry Gut: Coping With Colitis And Crohn's Disease,['W. Grant Thompson'],"The New England Journal of Medicine lauds Dr. W. Grant Thompson as ""a gifted teacher and clinician with a talent for clear exposition."" In the spirit of the highly acclaimed Gut Reactions, Dr. Thompson shares his expertise on how to cope with two widespread and debilitating diseases - colitis and Crohn's disease. These two chronic, nonfatal yet devastating ailments typically strike the young and may develop into a lifetime burden. Most patients are traumatized by their diagnosis and become frustrated and depressed by the recurring nature of these illnesses. As a result, caring and open communication between patient and doctor is essential. Perhaps more so than a physician in any other specialty, a gastroenterologist must be in tune with the mind and body of his patient. Dr. Thompson, an international expert and chief of a hospital gastroenterology unit, epitomizes this valuable quality and bestows the fruit of his knowledge and compassion on the reader. In addition to highlighting the significant similarities and differences of these two syndromes and stressing the importance of a correct diagnosis, Dr. Thompson broaches more sensitive topics that seem to be ignored by the medical profession. He explores the unique psychosocial and sexual concerns, as well as the effects of pregnancy on those women who suffer from these conditions. His gift for writing and warm, caring style make the daily struggles of these illnesses seem easier to bear. One of the worst consequences of these stubborn ailments is the accompanying reduction in the quality of life. Dr. Thompson addresses common worries about body image due to illness or surgery, loss of sexual drive or ability to perform, pain and suffering, possible effects of medication, and concern over the ominous relationship between ulcerative colitis and cancer. In accessible and supportive prose, Dr. Thompson examines the pros and cons of all possible treatments including drug therapy, nutrition, and surgery. He outlines

Eight Plays For Children: The New Generation Play Project,"['Jennings', 'Coleman A.']","The New Generation Play Project was a daring experiment in American children's theatre. Begun in 1989 by a consortium that included the Seattle Children's Theatre, The Children's Theatre Company of Minneapolis, Stage One: The Louisville Children's Theatre, and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth, the NGPP raised half a million dollars to commission major American dramatists to create new works for young people and to produce these plays over a several-year period.<br>
 This book provides the full text of the plays produced through the NGPP:<br>
• Constance Congdon, Beauty and the Beast<br>
• Velina Hasu Houston, Hula Heart<br>
• Tina Howe, East of the Sun and West of the Moon<br>
• Len Jenkin, The Invisible Man<br>
• Mark Medoff, Kringle's Window<br>
• Eric Overmyer, Duke Kahanamoku vs. The Surfnappers<br>
• Michael Weller, Dogbrain<br>
• Y York, The Witch of Blackbird Pond In his introduction, Coleman Jennings describes the work of the NGPP, some of the controversies surrounding its selection of playwrights who do not ordinarily write for young audiences, as well as the playwrights' reactions to the project, and the critical reception of the plays. Suzan Zeder, one of the nation's leading playwrights for family audiences, supplies the foreword.<br>"
The New Poverty,['Ralph Da Costa Nunez'],"The New Poverty: Homeless Families in America explores the complex issues surrounding the epidemic of homelessness and presents plausible solutions to reverse the spread of this scourge. The book clearly defines the extent of the issue - its scale, severity, and scope - and offers a viable alternative to stem homelessness, poverty, and welfare dependence in America. Dr. Nunez, esteemed for his work in social welfare policy, makes an important contribution to the current literature on homelessness by proposing a bold new direction for national homeless policy, one that calls for the transformation of the emergency shelter system into comprehensive residential-educational-employment training centers that are child focused and family based. Supported by compelling interviews and photographs of homeless families, the author logically contends that with education, family preservation services, and job training, these families can become self-sufficient. However, if they are deprived of these opportunities, another generation of children will grow up without homes and without the traditional values of work, responsibility, and independence. The New Poverty is intended to reach many audiences, from general readers to professionals in sociology, political science, education, public policy, and the legal and medical communities. In the midst of the current tense political climate, this extraordinary book will educate and enlighten the public on the history and realities of family homelessness, as well as give policy makers and academics substantive material to help make decisions and develop policy and program directives."
Modularity In Knowledge Representation And Natural-language Understanding (a Bradford Book),"['Garfield', 'Jay L.']","The notion of modularity, introduced by Noam Chomsky and developed with special emphasis on perceptual and linguistic processes by Jerry Fodor in his important book <i>The Modularity of Mind,</i> has provided a significant stimulus to research in cognitive science. This book presents essays in which a diverse group of philosophers, linguists, psycholinguists, and neuroscientists—including both proponents and critics of the modularity hypothesis—address general questions and specific problems related to modularity."
Forms Of Life: Character And Moral Imagination In The Novel,"['Price, Martin , 1920-']","The novel contains imagined lives that achieve a kind of meaning and intensity our own lives do not. Out of the novelist's moral imagination-the breadth and depth of his awareness of human motivations, tensions, and complexities-emerge fictional persons through whom we learn to read ourselves. This eloquent book, exploring fictional lives in crucial moments of choice and change, stresses both their difference from and their deep connections with life.
<p>Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.</p>
<p>Avoiding both formalistic and moralistic extremes, this new book by a distinguished critic helps us recover a fuller sense of literary form and the forms of life from which it emerges.</p>"
Year of the elephant: a Moroccan woman's journey toward independence and other stories,"['Abū Zayd, Laylá , 1950-']","The novella and eight short stories that constitute Year of the Elephant--an allusion to a battle described in the Qur'an--serve as an eloquent representation of life in the wake of Morocco's successful struggle for independence from French occupation. In the titular novella the protagonist, Zahra, has just returned to her hometown after being divorced by her husband for being too traditional and unable to keep up with his modern way of life. Having devoted herself, alongside her husband, to the creation of an independent Morocco, she had expected to share the fruits of independence with him, but instead she finds herself cast out into a strange world. As Zahra struggles to find a place for herself in this new Morocco, her efforts reflect Moroccan society's attempt as a whole to chart a path in the conflict between tradition and modernism.<br>
 When published in English in 1989, Year of the Elephant was the first novel by a Moroccan woman to be translated from Arabic into English. In the years since, it has become popular with readers for the unique picture it provides of Moroccan life and North African Islamic culture. This revised edition includes an introduction, which looks at the impact of the English translation since its original publication, and a study guide.<br>"
Biofuture,['Burke K. Zimmerman'],"The ongoing revolution in genetic research and cell biology promises to change the way we look at life itself. Over the last decade hysterical predictions of genetic accidents and of misdirected genetic engineering and wild speculation in the booming biotechnology market have continued to make dramatic headlines. Avoiding the sensationalism that has surrounded this new field, Dr. Zimmerman draws on his long experience in the laboratory, in legislative committees, and in international biotechnology to provide a balanced perspective on the startling developments that are only now beginning."
Mister: The Training Of An Aviation Cadet In World War Ii,['Eugene Fletcher'],"The pilots and crews of B-17 bombers in World War II made history even before they flew their first missions. Not only did they bring aerial warfare to new levels of power, but they were the products of a training program that was unprecedented in its scale and complexity. In a one-year course, thousands of civilians, most of them with no flying experience, were taught the technical skills, teamwork, and emotional toughness required to fly a huge and complex plane in combat. Many books have been written about the air battles of World War II, but none has taken the reader through the process that transformed young men into combat pilots. Eugene Fletcher, author of Fletcher's Gang, an account of his crew's missions over Europe, now provides an engaging and authentic look at that training. Fletcher was raised on a Depression-squeezed farm in Eastern Washington. After two years as a teenage professional jockey, he returned home to finish high school and then entered Whitman College on a scholarship. While there he earned a civilian pilot's license. When he received his draft notice in June 1942, he enlisted in the grueling aviation training program of the Army Air Force. Mister is the story of Fletcher's training year: both the education of a combat pilot and the experiences shared by Gene and his wife Sherry, who were among the thousands of young couples who started their lives together in a state of nomadic uncertainty. The danger, the boredom, the discipline, and the exhilaration of aviation training all are vividly recalled. Fletcher and his classmates were part of a huge high-stakes experiment that showed the military at its dedicated best and its demeaning worst. By January 1944, Fletcher had command of a giant B-17 bomber and a ten-man crew. He was twenty-two. A year later, he and the rest of ""Fletcher's Gang"" had flown thirty-five combat missions in Europe without a casualty. Fletcher's Gang provided an unforgettable portrait of daily life at the height of"
Choosing Who's To Live: Ethics And Aging,"['Walters, James W. (james William)']","The population is rapidly aging while access to proper and affordable medical treatment is becoming more and more limited. This impasse challenges us to make ethical decisions regarding the rationing of health care. Arguing that de facto rationing is already taking place due to economic necessity and that proper management of this rationing is essential to the fair and ethical treatment of all seeking care, Choosing Who's to Live directly addresses one of the most challenging moral questions of our day. Appearing in the wake of increasing awareness of health care reform, this volume identifies four compelling arguments for managed health care rationing: the number of citizens over age eighty-five will increase 500 percent by the year 2040; current baby boomers could live longer than today's elderly by seven to fifteen years; new medical technologies are appearing every day; and the ratio of workers to retirees will be 1:4 in forty years instead of the current 1:2.5. In this volume, six leading scholars take the discussion of rationing health care beyond the simple idea of withholding government-funded, live-saving treatment from the very old to a more ethical, effective treatment plan for all."
Pershing: General of the Armies,['Donald Smythe'],"The product of nearly 25 years of research, <i>Pershing: General of the Armies</i> remains one of the most authoritative biographies of the man known as Black Jack. Newly appointed head of the American Expeditionary Forces, Pershing sailed for Europe in May 1917. Once in France, he set about the task of building an army. By October the Americans were at the front and over the next year became involved in increasingly significant battles, all vividly recounted here: Cantigny, Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, Soissons, St. Mihiel, and the 47 the Meuse-Argonne. Although the impact of the American forces on the outcome of the war has been much debated, there is no question that the troops acquitted themselves well under Pershing's command. Pershing's postwar life included an unsuccessful run for president, a stint as Chief of Staff, and a secret romance with a French woman 34 years younger than he; nonetheless, his influence as a leader extended into World War II."
The Handbook Of Divorce Mediation,"['L. Marlow', 'S.r.

The second is to take the practitioner through a complete mediation, and while intended for the experience mediator as well as for the beginner, it nevertheless assumes that the practitioner is about to conduct his first mediation."
Educating The Able (special Needs In Ordinary Schools),['Diane Montgomery'],"The purpose of this book is to enable teachers to develop explicit criteria for identifying and helping able pupils. After discussing the nature of ability and talent and identifying the able child, Diane Montgomery examines curriculum provision, paying particular attention to the National Curriculum and surveying different types of provision: acceleration, enrichment and differentiation. She then describes methods of teaching for critical thinking. The book ends with a chapter on helping the underfunctioning able child. Throughout, there are numerous examples and practical suggestions. Teachers in primary and secondary schools as well as in higher education will find this book invaluable both as an introduction to the area and as a source of ideas."

Understanding Health Care Reform (yale Fastback Series),['Theodore R. Marmor'],"The reform of American medical care is the most important topic on the nation's domestic agenda and the centerpiece of the Clinton administration's plans for social policy and long-term economic development. This book, written by a preeminent analyst of medical politics and policy who is a frequent adviser to Congress, helps to clarify the current debate over the President's bill and the proposed alternatives to it. It is essential reading for 1994.
<p>Theodore Marmor, whose work has appeared in scholarly journals and books, as well as in the nation's major newspapers and magazines, here presents some of his most recent writings that illuminate the historical, political, and economic considerations lying behind various proposals now under debate. Marmor explains what we can and cannot expect from reform of American medicine, and he addresses the many conflicting claims about the remedies for America's problems with medical costs, quality, access, and organizations. He discusses, for example:</p>
<p>-the misplaced faith that cutting waste will greatly ease our financial troubles and markedly improve our health;</p>
<p>-the exaggerated arguments for ""managed competition"";</p>
<p>-the myths that either non-profit or for-profit institutions are the key to reform;</p>
<p>-the misleading and fearful debate over rationing;</p>
<p>-the lessons to be learned from Canada's and Japan's experiments with universal health insurance;</p>
<p>-the controversial place of Medicare in the current reform struggle;</p>
<p>-barriers facing implementation of any of the major health care proposals;</p>
<p>-and the possibility of fusing different approaches to achieve reform.</p>

Egyptian Myths (the Legendary Past),['George Hart'],"The rich panorama of ancient Egyptian mythology has survived through tomb paintings, temple inscriptions, and papyri. This account begins with the creation legends of Heliopolis, Memphis, and Hermopolis and illustrates the intellectual struggles of the Egyptians to explain the beginning of the world. The myths that follow range from stories about the gods -- the murder of Osiris and vengeance of Horus, Isis and the seven scorpions, Sakhmet and the virtual slaughter of mankind -- to fables such as the Shipwrecked Sailor and the Enchanted Island. Through these delightful and often amusing tales, we can appreciate more fully the beliefs and imagination of the ancient Egyptians."
The Robot In The Garden: Telerobotics And Telepistemology In The Age Of The Internet (leonardo Books),['Roger F. Malina; Sean Cubitt'],"The Robot in the Garden initiates a critical theory of telerobotics and introduces telepistemology, the study of knowledge acquired at a distance. Many of our most influential technologies -- the telescope, telephone, and television -- were developed to provide knowledge at a distance. Telerobots, remotely controlled robots, facilitate action at a distance. Specialists use telerobots to explore environments such as Mars, the Titanic, and Chernobyl. Military personnel increasingly employ reconnaissance drones and telerobotic missiles. At home, we have remote controls for the garage door, car alarm, and television (the latter a remote for the remote).
<p>The Internet dramatically extends our scope and reach. Thousands of cameras and robots are now accessible online. Although the role of technical mediation has been of interest to philosophers since the seventeenth century, the Internet forces a reconsideration. As the public gains access to telerobotic instruments previously restricted to scientists and soldiers, questions of mediation, knowledge, and trust take on new significance for everyday life.</p>

Portrait of American Jews: the last half of the twentieth century,"['Heilman, Samuel C.']","The second half of the twenthieth century has been a time when American Jews have experienced a minimum of prejudice and almost all domains of life have been accessible to them, but it has also been a time of assimilation, of swelling rates of inter-marriage, and of large numbers ignoring their Jewishness completely. Jews have no trouble building synagogues, but they have all sorts of trouble filling them. The quality of Jewish education is perhapes higher than ever before, and the output of Jewish scholarship is overwhelming in its scope and quality, but most American Jews receive a minimum of religious education and can neither read nor comprehend the great corpus of Jewish literature in its Hebrew (or Aramaic) original. This is a time in America when there is no shame in being a Jew, and yet fewer American Jews seem to know what being a Jew means. This book is part of a stocktaking that has been occurring among Jews as the century in which their residence in America was firmly established comes to an end. Grounded in empirical detail, it provides a concise yet analytic evaluation of the meaning of the many studies and surveys of the last four and a half decades. All those who want to know what it means and has meant to be an American Jew will find this volume of interest."
"Cloak And Gavel: Fbi Wiretaps, Bugs, Informers, And The Supreme Court",['Alexander Charns'],"The separation of powers becomes a meaningless cliche as Alexander Charns - using the Federal Bureau of Investigation's own files - reveals how that agency undermined the independence of the U.S. Supreme Court for a half-century. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's goal was simple: to push the Supreme Court to the right on issues of civil rights and criminal law. His techniques ranged from illegal wiretapping to spreading disinformation, from using Justice Abe Fortas as an informant to trying to hound liberal Justice William O. Douglas off the bench. Cloak and Gavel, the definitive work on the FBI-Supreme Court relationship, is based on thousands of pages of FBI documents that Charns fought for eight years to obtain. One 2,000-page file was released only after he filed hundreds of Freedom of Information requests and brought lawsuits against the FBI. It establishes Hoover's strategies to influence the Senate confirmation process, incite the public against the Warren court, lobby for legislation to counteract judicial rulings, and use numerous informants inside the Court to both monitor and influence it. Charns was given special permission to conduct research using Justice Abe Fortas's papers, which had been sealed until the year 2000. These papers proved Fortas had acted as an informer for the White House and for the FBI during his tenure on the bench. Fortas ultimately left the Court in disgrace after an ethics scandal unrelated to his informant role. Charns also suggests that Hoover's death did not end the FBI's attempts to influence Congress and the federal judiciary - as evidenced by the role of the FBI in the explosive Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill Senate hearings in 1991. Until now, no one has examined the ultimate constitutional violation - the FBI's attempts to influence the Court by any means available."
The Shaker Experience In America: A History Of The United Society Of Believers,['Stephen J. Stein'],"The Shakers, once a radical religious sect whose members were despised and harassed by their fellow Americans, have in recent years become celebrated--and sentimentalized--for their communal way of life, the simplicity of their worship, their belief in celibacy, pacifism, and equality of the sexes, and not least their superb furniture and handicrafts. This monumental book is the first general history of the Shakers from their origins in eighteenth-century England to the present day. Drawing on written and oral testimony by Shakers over the past two centuries, Stephen J. Stein offers a full and often revisionist account of the movement: their charismatic leaders, the early years in revolutionary New York and New England, the expansion into the West, the maturation and growth of the sect before the Civil War, the decline in their fortunes after the war, the painful adjustments to society Shakers had to make during the first half of the twentieth century, the renaissance of interest after 1950, and the ""forbidden topic"" within contemporary Shakerism--the conflict between the two remaining villages at Canterbury, New Hampshire, and Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Stein provides many new interpretations of the Shaker experience. He reassesses the role of founder Ann Lee, emphasizes the impact of the western Shaker settlements on the course of the society's history, and describes the variety of cultural enterprises that have obscured the religious and historical dimensions of the Shakers. Throughout Stein places the Shaker experience within the wider context of American life and shows how the movement has evolved to deal with changing times. Shattering the romantic myth that has been perpetuated about the quaint and peaceful Shakers, Stein portrays a group that is factious, practical, and fully human.

The Simple Genetic Algorithm : Foundations and Theory,['Michael D. Vose'],"The Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is a classical form of genetic search. Viewing the SGA as a mathematical object, Michael D. Vose provides an introduction to what is known (i.e., proven) about the theory of the SGA. He also makes available algorithms for the computation of mathematical objects related to the SGA. Although he describes the SGA in terms of heuristic search, the book is not about search or optimization per se. Rather, the focus is on the SGA as an evolutionary system. The author intends the book also to serve as an outline for exploring topics in mathematics and computer science in a goal-oriented way."

Were its signers aware of the Declaration's full revolutionary significance, or did they see it as the rationale for an economic dispute? Such questions face any historian of the period and require an extraordinary control of materials, a sensitive reading of character and text, and a lucid gift for recreating a time more than two centuries ago for scholars and general readers alike."

<p>An introduction and summary provide an overview of the tax system, (including sources of revenue and trends in sources) and its relative impact on various groups and industries. Chapter 2 describes the current US tax structure and its incidence, and corrects a number of common misconceptions (income from capital is actually taxed less heavily than income from labor; the rich generally do not pay an appreciably higher proportion of their income in taxes than poorer groups.) Basic issues and problems in tax policy are analyzed in chapter 3, which points out that there is no strong scientific basis for believing that shifting income taxes from capital to labor or from upper to lower income groups would have a substantial long-run effect on saving or capital formation; in fact, the adverse impact on the labor supply could outweigh the beneficial effect on capital formation.</p>
<p>The final three chapters take up the major types of taxation: personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and consumption taxes. Attention is focused in particular on the congressional ""flat tax"" proposals by Bradley-Gephardt and Kemp-Kasten (the Treasury's proposal is summarized in the book's preface). A concluding chapter examines the advantages and disadvantages of two new forms of taxation-the value-added tax, which has been used extensively in Europe, and the as yet untested comprehensive cash-flow tax that has received substantial academic support in recent years. These consumption-based taxes represent a substantial departure from the present US tax structure, which is based primarily upon income.</p>"
Modernity And The Text,"['Huyssen, Andreas.', 'Bathrick, David.']","The study of Austrian and German modernist literature has a long and venerable history in this country. There have been no attempts yet, however, to reassess German and Austrian literary modernism in light of current discussion of modernity and postmodernity. Addressing a set of historical and theoretical questions central to current reevaluations of modernism, this volume presents American readers with a state-of-the-art account of German modernism studies in the eighties.Essays by Jochen Schulte-Sasse, Russell A. Berman, Peter Uwe Hohendahl, Judith Ryan, Mark Anderson, Klaus R. Scherpe, Biddy Martin, Klaus L. Berghahn and Acbar Abbas, center around German and Austrian literary and philosophical prose of the early twentieth century. texts by well-known authors -Kafka, Rilke, Musil, Doblin, Benjamin, Benn, and Junger - and less well-known ones -Franz Jung, Carl Einstein, Ernst Bloch, Lou Andreas-Salome, are examined. Particular attention is paid to the processes and strategies by which certain experiences of ""modern life"" are translated into modern aesthetic forms. The unique contribution of this volume is that it combines theory with an attempt to reintroduce an historical and contextual dimension. The authors believe that their revisions of Ausrian and German modernism will themselves be informed by a new set of questions pertinent to the modernist debate.<br>"
Jihad: The Rise Of Militant Islam In Central Asia,['Ahmed Rashid'],"The terrorist attacks of September 11 have turned the world's attention to areas of the globe about which we know very little. Ahmed Rashid, who masterfully explained Afghanistan's Taliban regime in his previous book, here turns his skills as an investigative journalist to the five Central Asian republics adjacent to Afghanistan. 
<p>Central Asia is coming to play a vital strategic role in the war on terrorism, but the region also poses new threats to global security. The five Central Asian republics-Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan-were part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. Under Soviet rule, Islam was brutally suppressed, and that intolerance has continued under the post-Soviet regimes. Religious repression, political corruption, and the region's extreme poverty (unemployment rates exceed 80 percent in some areas) have created a fertile climate for militant Islamic fundamentalism. Often funded and trained by such organizations as Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda and the Taliban, guerrilla movements like the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan) have recruited a staggering number of members across the region and threaten to topple the governments of all five nations.</p>
<p>Based on groundbreaking research and numerous interviews, Jihad explains the roots of militant rage in Central Asia, describes the goals and activities of these militant organizations, and suggests ways in which this threat could be neutralized by diplomatic and economic intervention. Rich in both cultural heritage and natural resources-including massive oil reservoirs-Central Asia remains desperately poor and frighteningly volatile. In tracing the history of Central Asia andexplaining the current political climate, Rashid demonstrates that it is a region we ignore at our peril.</p>
<p>Author Biography: Ahmed Rashid is a journalist based in Lahore. He is the Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review and the Daily Telegraph. He also writes for the Wall Street Journal. Rashid's previous book, Taliban (published by Yale University Press), reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages.</p>"
The Longhorns,['J. Frank Dobie'],"The Texas Longhorn made more history than any other breed of cattle the world has known. These wiry, intractable beasts were themselves pioneers in a harsh land, moving elementally with drouth, grass, Arctic blizzards, and burning winds. Their story is the bedrock on which the history of the cow country of America is founded. <p>J. Frank Dobie was a tale spinner who appreciated the proper place of legend and folklore in history. In The Longhorns, he tells of the Spanish conquistadors, who brought their cattle with them; of ranching in the turbulent colonial times; of the cowboy, whose abandon, energy, insolence, and pride epitomized the booming West. He writes of terrifying stampedes, titantic bull fights on the range, ghost steers, and encounters with Indians.</p>"
The Crucible of War: Montgomery and Alamein,['Barrie Pitt'],"The third volume explains how the Allies fared in their early efforts to defend Egypt from the wiles of Field Marshal Rommel and the German Afrika Korps. The series of Allied victories in the North African desert that routed the Italian defenders came to an abrupt end with Rommel's arrival on the scene. In the early clashes with the Afrika Korps, Britain's Field Marshal Richard O'Connor was captured, and Field Marshal Archibald Wavell was replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck. Auchinleck had been an excellent soldier, but his choice of commanders turned out to be a disaster, as they were out-thought and out-fought by Rommel. Ultimately, Auckinleck himself took command and ended Rommel's immediate threat.<br>"
Calamities Of Exile,['Lawrence Weschler'],"The three narratives by Lawrence Weschler here joined together were conceived from the start as a sort of triptych: three tales about basically decent expatriates the first an Iraqi, the second a Czech, the third an Afrikaner, each of whom tries to do the right thing with regard to the totalitarian regime holding sway over his homeland - the thing we readers, too, might have done, if only we were much more courageous than we are - only to end up thoroughly wracked and bollixed."
"The official Tour de France centennial, 1903-2003",['Tour De France (bicycle Race)'],"The Tour de France is an event unrivalled in sports, filled with unparalleled passion, adventure, and sheer physical difficulty.

Persian Myths,['Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis'],"The traditional tales and stories of ancient Iran, which occupied a vast area of Central Asia, describe confrontations between good and evil, the victories of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous supernatural creatures such as the magical bird Simergh and the dev or black demons. Much of our information about Iran's pre-Islamic past comes from the holy book of the Zoroastrian religion, the Avesta, which was not written down in its present form until the thirteenth or fourteenth century A.D. but dates back originally to between 1400 and 1200 B.C. As well as the words of the prophet Zoroaster and stories about the wise lord Ahura Mazda, it also incorporates earlier pagan myths which reappear in the Shahnameh (Book of Kings), a magnificent epic in rhyme complete in A.D. 1010 by the poet Firdausi and featuring his most famous hero, Rustam. Dr. Curtis draws upon all of these sources to retell for modern readers the stirring legends of ancient Iran, which have inspired centuries of manuscript illustrations."
Triumph of Wounded Souls: Seven Holocaust Survivors' Lives,['Bernice Lerner'],"The Triumph of Wounded Souls vividly recounts the stories of seven Holocaust survivors who overcame many obstacles to earn advanced degrees and become college and university professors.

"Fifty Years Of Change On The U.s.-mexico Border: Growth, Development, And Quality Of Life","['Joan B. Anderson', 'James Gerber']","The U.S. and Mexican border regions have experienced rapid demographic and economic growth over the last fifty years. In this analysis, Joan Anderson and James Gerber offer a new perspective on the changes and tensions pulling at the border from both sides through a discussion of cross-border economic issues and thorough analytical research that examines not only the dramatic demographic and economic growth of the region, but also shifts in living standards, the changing political climate, and environmental pressures, as well as how these affect the lives of people in the border region.<br>
Creating what they term a Border Human Development Index, the authors rank the quality of life for every U.S. county and Mexican municipio that touches the 2,000-mile border. Using data from six U.S. and Mexican censuses, the book adeptly illustrates disparities in various aspects of economic development between the two countries over the last six decades.<br>
Anderson and Gerber make the material accessible and compelling by drawing an evocative picture of how similar the communities on either side of the border are culturally, yet how divided they are economically. The authors bring a heightened level of insight to border issues not just for academics but also for general readers. The book will be of particular value to individuals interested in how the border between the two countries shapes the debates on quality of life, industrial growth, immigration, cross-border integration, and economic and social development."

All Yesterdays' Parties,['Paul Bass'],"The Velvet Underground, among the most influential bands of all time, are credited with creating a streetwise, pre-punk sensibility that has become inseparable from the popular image of downtown New York. ""Discovered"" by Andy Warhol in 1966, the VU - with their original line-up of Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Mo Tucker - would soon become the house band of the avantgarde, composing songs simultaneously furious in their abrasiveness and beautiful in their pathos, standing in striking contrast to the prevailing flower power of the era. <i>All Yesterdays' Parties</i> gathers for the first time almost all of the published writings contemporary with the band's existence-from sources as mainstream as the <i>New York Times</i> to vanished voices of the counterculture like <i>Oz, Fusion</i>, and <i>Crawdaddy!</i> The book is a revealing snapshot of an era by trailblazing rock writers such as Lester Bangs, Robert Greenfield, and Paul Williams. With photographs, posters, and other visual evocations of the period throughout, <i>All Yesterdays' Parties</i> is an invaluable resource, a trove of lore for anyone interested in the VU, their roots, and legacy."
Mary Through The Centuries: Her Place In The History Of Culture,['Professor Jaroslav Pelikan'],"The Virgin Mary has been an inspiration to more people than any other woman who ever lived. For Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims, for artists, musicians, and writers, and for women and men everywhere she has shown many faces and personified a variety of virtues. In this important book, a world-renowned scholar who is the author of numerous books - including the best-selling Jesus Through the Centuries - tells how Mary has been depicted and venerated through the ages. Jaroslav Pelikan examines the biblical portrait of Mary, analyzing both the New and Old Testaments to see how the bits of information provided about her were expanded into a full-blown doctrine. He explores the view of Mary in late antiquity, where the differences between Mary, the mother of Christ, and Eve, the ""mother of all living,"" provided positive and negative symbols of women. He discusses how the Eastern church commemorated Mary and how she was portrayed in the Holy Qur'an of Islam. He explains how the paradox of Mary as Virgin Mother shaped the paradoxical Catholic view of sexuality and how Reformation rejection of the worship of Mary allowed her to be a model of faith for Protestants. He considers also her role in political and social history. He analyzes the place of Mary in literature - from Dante, Spenser, and Milton to Wordsworth, George Eliot, and Goethe - as well as in music and art, and he describes the miraculous apparitions of Mary that have been experienced by the common people."
Wild West Shows,['Paul Reddin'],"The Wild West: a term that conjures up pictures of wagon trains, unspoiled prairies, Indians, rough 'n' ready cowboys, roundups, and buffalo herds. Where did this collection of images come from?"
The Work Of Poetry,['John Hollander'],"The Work of Poetry is organized into three parts. ""Poetic Substance"" explores the nature of poetry and the poet, with essays that cover the poet ""being-and-feeling-at-home"" in his or her work and the parallels between dreams and poetry. Next, ""Poetic Experiences"" examines the relationship between the poems and the individual, whether a poet or a reader of poetry, through such writings as ""Hearing and Overhearing the Psalms,"" recounting Hollander's poetic childhood, and ""My Poetic Generation."" The final chapters, ""The Work of Poets,"" deal with the poets themselves, and it is here that Hollander gives insightful readings of the works of Whitman, Robert Penn Warren, and others. Readers who have struggled with the verse of poets like John Ashbery will be grateful for Hollander's masterful readings. They will also discover the enchantment this visionary poet can create from a seemingly dry topic, like the preposition ""of,"" and the clarity he imparts to such contested and ambiguous topics as originality. Serious admirers and students of verse who seek to comprehend its subtleties will find The Work of Poetry a rich and moving source of wisdom.

Marshall's Tendencies: What Can Economists Know? (gaston Eyskens Lectures),['John Sutton'],"The world of economics is a complicated and messy place. Yet modern economic analysis rests on an attempt to represent the world by means of simple mathematical models. To what extent is this possible? How can such a program cope with the fact that economic outcomes are often driven by factors that are notoriously difficult to quantify? Can such mathematical modeling lead us to theories that work? In these lectures, John Sutton explores what he calls the ""standard paradigm"" that lies at the heart of economic model building, whose roots go back a century to the work of Alfred Marshall. In probing the strengths and limitations of this paradigm, he looks at some of the remarkable successes, as well as deep disappointments, that have flowed from it.

The Yale Dictionary Of Art And Artists,['Norbert Lynton; Erika Langmuir'],"The Yale Dictionary of Art and Artists is a superb reference work dealing with all aspects of Western art from 1300 to the present day.

Scotch Verdict: Miss Pirie And Miss Woods V. Dame Cumming Gordon,"['Faderman, Lillian']","The year: 1810. The place: Edinburgh, Scotland. A student, Jane Cumming, accuses her school mistresses, Jane Pirie and Marianne Woods, of having an affair in the presence of their students. Dame Cumming Gordon, the wealthy and powerful grandmother of the accusing student, advises her friends to remove their daughters from the boarding school. Within days, the school is deserted and the two women deprived of their livelihood. Lillian Faderman, award-winning author of Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers, gives an extraordinary rendering of the real-life story on which Lillian Hellman based her famous play, The Children's Hour. Faderman reconstructs the libel suit filed by Pirie and Woods that eventually resulted in a scotch verdict - a verdict of not proven or an inconclusive decision. Through court transcripts, judges' notes, and her personal reflections on the witnesses' contradictory testimony and the prejudices of the men presiding over the case, Faderman skillfully documents the social, economic, and sexual pressures that shaped the lives of nineteenth-century women. Provocative and compelling, not only does Scotch Verdict point to the marginalization of women by raising issues of class, gender, and sexuality with respect to Pirie and Woods, but also of race in its depiction of Jane Cumming, the half-Indian child who was born in India and out of wedlock to Dame Cumming Gordon's eldest son.

                        <p>Exploring the economic status of women in the 19th century, author Lilliam Faderman details the true-life case of two young Scottish schoolmistresses who were deprived of their livelihoods after being falsely accused of carrying on an affair in front of their students. Faderman examines the customs and attitudes of the era in relation to women today.

Fire And Blood: A History Of Mexico,['T. R. Fehrenbach'],"There have been many Mexicos: the country of varied terrain, of Amerindian heritage, of the Spanish Conquest, of the Revolution, and of the modern era of elections and the rule of bankers. Mexico was forged in the fires of successive civilizations, and baptized with the blood of millions, all of whom added tragic dimensions to the modern Mexican identity. T. R. Fehrenbach brilliantly delineates the contrasts and conflicts between them, unraveling the history while weaving a fascinating tapestry of beauty and brutality: the Amerindians, who wrought from the vulnerable land a great indigenous Meso-American civilization by the first millennium B.C.; the successive reigns of Olmec, Maya, Toltec, and Mexic masters, who ruled through an admirably efficient bureaucracy and the power of the priests, propitiating the capricious gods with human sacrifices; the Spanish conquistadors, who used smallpox, technology, and their own ruthless individualism to erect a new tyranny over the ruins of the old; the agony of independent Mexico, struggling with the weight of its overwhelming past and tremendous potential. Throughout the narrative the author resurrects the great personalities of Mexican history, such as Motecuhzoma, Cortes, Santa Anna, Juárez, Maximilian, Díaz, Pancho Villa, and Zapata. Fehrenbach, who has updated this edition to include recent events, has created a work of scholarly perspective and gripping prose.

Enemies Within,"['Goldberg, Robert Alan']","There is a hunger for conspiracy news in America. Hundreds of Internet websites, magazines, newsletters, even entire publishing houses, disseminate information on invisible enemies and their secret activities, subversions, and coverups. Those who suspect conspiracies behind events in the news -- the crash of TWA Flight 800, the death of Marilyn Monroe -- join generations of Americans, from the colonial period to the present day, who have entertained visions of vast plots. In this enthralling book Robert Goldberg focuses on five major conspiracy theories of the past half-century, examining how they became widely popular in the United States and why they have remained so.
<p> In the post-World War II decades conspiracy theories have become more numerous, more commonly believed, and more deeply embedded in our culture, Goldberg contends. He investigates conspiracy theories regarding the Roswell UFO incident, the communist threat, the rise of the Antichrist, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the Jewish plot against black America, in each case considering the various historical, social, and political influences. Conspiracy theories are not merely the products of a lunatic fringe, the author shows. Rather, paranoid rhetoric and thinking are disturbingly central in America today. With media validation and dissemination of conspiracy ideas, and with federal government behavior that damages public confidence and faith, the ground is fertile for conspiracy thinking.</p>"

"Observation, Experiment, And Hypothesis In Modern Physical Science (johns Hopkins Center For The History And Philosophy Of Science)","['Owen Hannaway', 'Peter Achinstein']","These original contributions by philosophers and historians of science discuss a range of issues pertaining to the testing of hypotheses in modern physics by observation and experiment.
<p>Chapters by Lawrence Sklar, Dudley Shapere, Richard Boyd, R. C. Jeffrey, Peter Achinstein, and Ronald Laymon explore general philosophical themes with applications to modern physics and astrophysics. The themes include the nature of the hypothetico-deductive method, the concept of observation and the validity of the theoretical-observation distinction, the probabilistic basis of confirmation, and the testing of idealizations and approximations.</p>
<p>The remaining four chapters focus on the history of particular twentieth-century experiments, the instruments and techniques utilized, and the hypotheses they were designed to test. Peter Galison reviews the development of the bubble chamber; Roger Stuewer recounts a sharp dispute between physicists in Cambridge and Vienna over the interpretation of artificial disintegration experiments; John Rigden provides a history of the magnetic resonance method; and Geoffrey Joseph suggests a statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics that can be used to interpret the Stern-Gerlach and double-slit experiments.</p>

A Bishop's Tale: Mathias Hovius Among His Flock In Seventeenth-century Flanders,"['Mr. Craig Harline', 'Dr. Eddy Put']","This absorbing book takes us back to the busy, colorful world of a Netherlandish Catholic bishop and his flock during the age of Reformation. It is drawn from a rare journal, one of many kept by Mathias Hovius from 1596 to 1620 while he was Archbishop of Mechelen (part of modern Belgium). Elegantly written, the book focuses not only on the life of Mathias Hovius but also on key events and characters of his time; it portrays ""lived religion,"" so that we see people from all sides getting involved in the constant negotiation of what it meant to be a good Catholic.
<p>Craig Harline and Eddy Put recreate the eventful life and times of Mathias Hovius—a world in which other-believers were outright heretics, the nagging fevers of old age were the result of unbalanced bodily humors, and a corruptible earth rested motionless at the center of the universe while God sat exalted on a throne just beyond the fixed stars. The authors also tell the stories of monks, nuns, priests, millers, pilgrims, peasant women, saints, town and village councils, and ordinary parishioners; each story, fascinating in its own right, illustrates a major theme in the history of the Catholic Reformation. In the end Harline and Put have painted a picture teeming with life and energy.<br>

"Japan among the Powers, 1880-1990",['Sydney Giffard'],"This absorbing book, written by an author who has lived in and studied Japan for many years, provides a fresh perspective on Japan's history, politics, and culture over the past hundred years. It traces Japan's phenomenal development into one of the world's great powers, portraying events in Japan - and its rapid industrialization - as shaped by Japanese decision-makers rather than as generally perceived by the outside world. Beginning in 1890, the year in which the country's first modern constitution came into being and the Imperial Diet was first convened, Giffard describes Japan's determination to gain an equal footing with the dominant nations of the West. He examines the complex interplay, through the century, of forces underlying economic development during peace and war, analyzing the conflicts and contradictions as well as the achievements. Recognizing the role of individuals in the development of modern Japan, Giffard provides insights into many important leaders - from those who directed comprehensive national transformation at the start of the century to those who inspired economic recovery after World War Two. He concludes by analyzing the demand for political reform in Japan, up to the spring of 1992, and its implications for Japan's future as a world power."

Feeding The World: A Challenge For The Twenty-first Century,"['Smil, Vaclav.']","This book addresses the question of how we can best feed the ten billion or so people who will likely inhabit the Earth by the middle of the twenty-first century. Vaclav Smil asks whether human ingenuity can produce enough food to support healthy and vigorous lives for all these people without irreparably damaging the integrity of the biosphere.
<p> This book differs from other books on the world food situation in its consideration of the complete food cycle, from agriculture to post-harvest losses and processing to eating and discarding. Taking a scientific approach, Smil espouses neither the catastrophic view that widespread starvation is imminent nor the cornucopian view that welcomes large population increases as the source of endless human inventiveness. He shows how we can make more effective use of current resources and suggests that if we increase farming efficiency, reduce waste, and transform our diets, future needs may not be as great as we anticipate. Smil's message is that the prospects may not be as bright as we would like, but the outlook is hardly disheartening.</p>"
Nursing Malpractice: Implications For Clinical Practice And Nursing Education,"['Beckmann, Janet Pitts , 1946-']","This book came about by chance. Through a very close friend and colleague, I was approached fifteen years ago by a prominent attorney to review a nursing malpractice case. I said I was not interested because I associated such cases with attorneys who were 'out there' making trouble. To make a long story short, my friend twisted my arm and I looked at the case. What I learned shocked me. Never in my worst imaginings had I thought that nurses could or would provide such poor care. - From the Introduction."
"Evidence, Argument, And Persuasion In The Policy Process",['Giandomenico Majone'],This book challenges the common assumption that policy analysts engage in purely objective technical assessment of policy alternatives. It argues instead that what analysts really do is produce policy arguments that are based on value judgments and are used by policymakers in the course of public debate. Giandomenico Majone shows that the essential need today is not to develop 'objective' measures of outcomes but rather to improve the methods and conditions of public discourse at all levels and stages of policy making.
No Fixed Points: Dance In The Twentieth Century,"['Nancy Reynolds', 'Malcolm Mccormick']","This book chronicles one hundred years of dramatic developments in ballet, modern, and experimental dance for stage and screen in Europe and North America. The volume is magisterial in scope, encompassing the history of theatrical dance from 1900 through 2000. Beginning with turn-of-the-century dancer-choreographers like Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Michel Fokine, and a bit later Vaslav Nijinsky, and proceeding through the profusion of dance styles performed today, the book provides an unparalleled view of dance in performance as it changed and grew in the twentieth century. Nancy Reynolds and Malcolm McCormick set dance in broader cultural and historical contexts, examine specific dance works, and explore the contributions of outstanding choreographers, performers, visual artists, impresarios, composers, critics, and other figures. They discuss the breakaway barefoot dance of the early 1900s and demonstrate its links with later forms and styles. With unusual detail, fascinating illustrations, and wide-ranging insights, this book is an indispensable guide to the transformations in the dance scene of the twentieth century.""There is simply no other history of twentieth-century dance that is as detailed, comprehensive, and readable as No Fixed Points.

Rome 1300: On The Path Of The Pilgrim,"['Herbert L. Kessler', 'Johanna Zacharias']","This book combines history and art history in very readable form. It is through an imagined woman's eyes that the authors and the reader see and are affected by the religious sites and rituals of Rome 1300 (e.g., the night-long procession of the icon of Christ from the Lateran to join the icon of Mary at S. Maria Maggiore across the city). The purpose of the book is to present medieval Rome as a living environment, to show how the major churches and the sacred relics, frescoes, icons, and mosaics within them actually served in the Middle Ages to attract the faithful and to confirm and teach belief among the throngs of pilgrims who flocked to the eternal city. The authors not only look back at what pilgrims ventured to see in Rome during the first Jubilee but forward to the Holy Year of 2000, when an estimated 45 million Catholics will retrace the steps of their forebears in search of plenary absolution."
The Design and Evaluation of a High Performance Smalltalk System,['David M. Ungar'],"This book documents two results that run counter to conventional wisdom about the Smalltalk-80 system. It shows that a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) can offer excellent performance for a system with dynamic data typing, and that automatic storage reclamation need not be time-consuming.<p>The Smalltalk-80 system makes it possible to write programs quickly by providing object-oriented programming, incremental compilation, run-time type checking, use-extensible data types and control structures, and an interactive graphical interface. However, the potential savings in programming effort have been curtailed by poor performance in widely-available computers or by high processor cost. To solve these problems, a group of researchers has designed and built the SOAR (Smalltalk on a RISC) microprocessor which is documented in this book.</p><p>Their findings suggest that: the language-specific hardware in SOAR doubles its performance over a RISC II with the same cycle time; generation scavenging, a storage reclamation algorithm developed by the author, consumes only 3 percent of the CPU time, in contrast to the 9 percent of comparable Smalltalk-80 systems; and that the SOAR microprocessor should run as fast as an ECL Dorado minicomputer, despite a five-to-one handicap in basic cycle time.

The Other Feminists: Activists In The Liberal Establishment,"['Hartmann, Susan M.']","This book enriches our understanding of the women's movement in the United States by showing how feminists captured a place for their goals on the agendas of four male-dominated liberal organizations in the 1960s and 1970s: the International Union of Electrical Workers, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Council of Churches, and the Ford Foundation. Susan M. Hartmann examines the efforts of women and men who had few ties to the independent women's movement - and thus have been neglected in studies of second-wave feminism - but who nonetheless contributed substantially to the spread of feminist ideas and practices into the mainstream of American society. These establishment groups furnished money, legitimacy, and access to the critical arenas of public opinion and government. Revising the common view that the second wave of feminism was a white middle-class phenomenon, Hartmann discovers significant numbers of women of color and working-class women who pushed feminist agendas."

They devote the remaining chapters to the solution of problems that arise from the restrictions imposed by Socrates's representation language and from the system's inefficiency.</p><p>The chapters dealing with the representation problem present a reified approach to temporal logic that makes it possible to use nonstandard logics without extending the system, and describe a general proof method for arbitrary modal logics.

Incentives For Environmental Protection (regulation Of Economic Activity),"['Schelling', 'Thomas']","This book explores the extent to which pricing incentives such as charges on emissions; in contrast to regulatory standards, can be shaped into a practical policy that is technically effective, politically enactable, administratively enforceable, and equitable. It also compares he advantages and disadvantages of this approach to those that characterize the policy of compliance to regulatory standards.

Geometric Investigation Of Reach (acm Distinguished Dissertation),['James U. Korein'],"This book focuses on a problem of fundamental importance in the robotics field, that of manipulating a geometric linkage resembling a human arm (or leg) with the intent of reaching specific points in space. Many analytic and numerical solutions have been developed for robot manipulators. Recently, a number of researchers have begun to investigate methods for the generation of manipulator workspaces (sometimes called reach envelopes). This work offers two new solutions to the reach problem-an analytic solution for the special case of singly redundant chains of the type exemplified by human arms and legs, and a solution for chains of arbitrary length which makes use of workspace descriptions. An algorithm is also developed for the approximation of workspaces by polyhedra, leading to an examination of the problem of sweeping polyhedra through space.

Kardio: A Study In Deep And Qualitative Knowledge For Expert Systems,"['Ivan Bratko', 'Igor Mozetic', 'Nada Lavac']","This book is the first detailed account of the development of a complex and successful expert system based on deep and qualitative knowledge. It shows how the qualitative modeling approach, using logic based representations and machine learning techniques, can be used to construct knowledge bases whose complexity is far beyond the capability of traditional, dialogue based techniques of knowledge acquisition.
<p>The relevant techniques are demonstrated in full detail in the building of Kardio, a medical expert system model of the human heart designed for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. Kardio's performance is estimated by cardiologists to be equivalent to that of a specialist of internal medicine (not a cardiologist) who is highly skilled in the reading of ECG recordings, and it can be used as a diagnostic tool in ECG interpretation. It may also be used for instruction in electrocardiography.</p>
<p>The authors show how the model was compiled, by means of qualitative simulation and machine learning tools, into various representations that are suited for particular expert tasks. They investigate a hierarchical organization of a qualitative model and outline an experiment whereby the construction of a deep model is automated by means of machine learning techniques.

What Americans Know About Politics And Why It Matters,"['Michael X. Delli Carpini', 'Scott Keeter']","This book is the most comprehensive analysis ever written about the American public's factual knowledge of politics. Drawing on extensive survey data, including much that is original, two experts in public opinion and political behavior find that many citizens are remarkably well informed about the details of politics, while equally large numbers are nearly ignorant of political facts. And despite dramatic changes in American society and politics, citizens appear no more or less informed today than half a century ago. Michael X. Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter demonstrate that informed persons are more likely to participate, better able to discern their own interests, and more likely to advocate those interests through political actions. Who, then, is politically informed? The authors provide compelling evidence that whites, men, and older, financially secure citizens have substantially more knowledge about national politics than do blacks, women, young adults, and financially less-well-off citizens. Thus citizens who are most disadvantaged socially and economically are least able to redress their grievances politically. Yet the authors believe that a broader and more equitably informed populace is possible. The challenge to America, they conclude, lies in providing an environment in which the benefits of being informed are clearer, the tools for gaining information more accessible, and the opportunities to learn about politics more frequent, timely, and equitable."

Neither the press nor the political system is likely to recover its standing, the author concludes, without taking into account their interrelationship. In a new preface, Janeway discusses recent events that bear out his premise."
A search-equilibrium approach to the micro foundations of macroeconomics,['Diamond'],"This book presents the second in the renewed Wicksell Lecture Series, sponsored by the Swedish Economic Association. In it, Peter A. Diamond discusses search equilibrium as a framework for integrating micro and macroeconomics. He first presents a formal model which addresses the difficulty and cost of coordinating trade (finding a trade partner) and notes the impact of costly trade coordination on production decisions. He then relates the model to the existing literature, and discusses micro data supporting a search approach.<p>Diamond incorporates the real-world fact that, contrary to the assumption of classical markets, the resource allocation process takes time and is hard to coordinate, and he argues that this fact is important for developing a sound theoretical basis for macroeconomic policy. Rather than being a rival theory, he argues that search equilibrium provides a promising basis for thinking about price and wage stickiness. Moreover, unlike standard rational expectations competitive models, Diamond's search model identifies multiple natural rates of unemployment, offering the potential for good and effective policy.</p>"

"Speech And Language In The Laboratory, School, And Clinic","['Kavanagh', 'James F.', 'And Winifred Strange', 'Editors']","This book reports the proceedings of a May 1976 conference entitled ""Implications of Basic Speech and Language Research for the School and Clinic,"" the sixth conference in the Communicating by Language series, sponsored by the Growth and Development Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Although the National Institutes of Health are traditionally associated with fundamental research, there has been growing public pressure for improvement in the communication of relevant laboratory research to the teacher and clinician. This conference brought together some of the country's foremost researchers and clinicians in an effort to examine both the present state of research in speech and language and how communication of that research to those concerned with its practical application might be improved.
<p>The book proceeds from the more ""physical"" problems of speech perception and production to the more cognitive problems of language meaning and memory. A summary of current knowledge about each topic is presented by a basic researcher, followed by a discussion from the clinician's point of view. The topics include all aspects of language processing in both adults and children, including physiological and acoustic aspects of the speech signal, perceptual processing and memory for speech and language, and processing syntactic and semantic information in sentence comprehension and lexical memory. A final paper reflects on selected themes of the conference and summarizes what the participants learned about the relation of basic research to areas of application.</p>"
The Rich Neighbor Policy: Rockefeller And Kaiser In Brazil,"['Cobbs Hoffman, Elizabeth']","'This book spells out in greater detail than any other study the complex relationship between public and private sectors in the operations of U.S. capitalism in Latin American after World War II. It should prove useful in the continuing debate over dependency, the nature of the development process, and the role of private investment-domestic and foreign-in stimulating economic growth.'"
Constraint Satisfaction In Logic Programming,['Pascal Van Hentenryck'],"This book tackles classic problems from operations research and circuit design using a logic programming language embedding consistency techniques, a paradigm emerging from artificial intelligence research. Van Hentenryck proposes a new approach to solving discrete combinatorial problems using these techniques.
<p>Logic programming serves as a convenient language for stating combinatorial problems, but its ""generate and test"" paradigm leads to inefficient programs. Van Hentenryck's approach preserves one of the most useful features of logic programming - the duality of its semantics - yet allows a short development time for the programs while preserving most of the efficiency of special purpose programs written in a procedural language.</p>
<p>Embedding consistency techniques in logic programming allows for ease and flexibility of programming and short development time because constraint propagation and tree-search programming are abstracted away from the user. It also enables logic programs to be executed efficiently as consistency techniques permit an active use of constraints to remove combinations of values that cannot appear in a solution Van Hentenryck presents a comprehensive overview of this new approach from its theoretical foundations to its design and implementation, including applications to real life combinatorial problems.</p>
<p>The ideas introduced in <i>Constraint Satisfaction in Logic Programming</i> have been used successfully to solve more than a dozen practical problems in operations research and circuit design, including disjunctive scheduling, warehouse location, cutting stock car sequencing, and microcode labeling problems.</p>
<p>Pascal Van Hentenryck is a member of the research staff at the European Computer Industry Research Centre. <i>Constraint Satisfaction in Logic Programming</i> is based on research for the Centre's CHIP project. As an outgrowth of this project, a new language (CHIP) that will include consistency techniques has been developed for commercial use. The book is included in the Logic Programming series edited by Ehud Shapiro.</p>"

Painters and the American West: the Anschutz collection,"['Troccoli, Joan Carpenter.']","This book takes us on a connoisseur's tour of art of the Old West, guiding us through the Anschutz collection, the finest group of paintings of the American West still in private hands. Joan Carpenter Troccoli looks at these paintings as aesthetic objects rather than historical documents, allowing us to see each work as a self-conscious fashioning of a personal vision and an integral part of mainstream American art.
<p>The collection is wide-ranging in scope, covering every phase in the history of American art since the 1820s. There are works from all the major artists who have depicted the West, including those who painted western subjects only occasionally as well as those whose subjects were predominantly western. Among the artists represented are Albert Bierstadt, George Caleb Bingham, George Bellows, Ernest Blumenschein, George Catlin, Stuart Davis, Asher B. Durand, Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, George Inness, Thomas Moran, John Marin, Alfred Jacob Miller, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frederic Remington, Charles Russell, and Walter Ufer. The collection is particularly rich in paintings made in Taos and Santa Fe in the first half of the twentieth century, when major American artists often found inspiration and stylistic renewal in the Southwest.</p>
<p>This book accompanies an exhibition that opens at the Denver Art Museum in October 2000 and will then travel to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, and the Art Institute of Chicago.<br>

Worlds Apart: Why Poverty Persists In Rural America,['Cynthia M. Duncan'],"This book takes us to three remote rural areas in the United States to hear the colorful stories of their residentsthe poor and struggling, the rich and powerful, and those in between - as they talk about their families and work, the hard times they've known, and their hopes and dreams. Cynthia M. Duncan examines the nature of poverty in Blackwell in Appalachia and in the Mississippi Delta town of Dahlia. She finds in these towns a persistent inequality that erodes the fabric of the community, feeds corrupt politics, and undermines institutions crucial for helping poor families achieve the American Dream. In contrast, New England's Gray Mountain enjoys a rich civic culture that enables the poor to escape poverty. Focusing on the implications of the differences among these communities, the author provides powerful new insights into the dynamics of poverty, politics, and community change."
Nature's Workshop: Renoir's Writings On The Decorative Arts,"['Professor Robert L. Herbert', 'Robert L. Herbert']","This book transforms our perception of Renoir's biography, and his social and intellectual status. Renoir is revealed to be both a radical and a reactionary, bitterly opposing the factory system that stripped the worker of initiative, turning him into a machine. The book provides not only invaluable insights into Renoir, but also a much-needed comparative study of the decorative arts in nineteenth-century France and Britain. All eleven texts (articles and letters for newspapers, draft essays etc.) are published both in English with a commentary by Herbert, and in French. Four introductory chapters by Herbert precede the texts. Includes unpublished writings, including Renoir's Grammar of Art, long thought to be lost."
"Puerto Rico: Culture, Politics, And Identity",['Nancy Morris'],"This book uses historical and interview data to trace the development of Puerto Rican identity in the 20th century. It analyzes how and why Puerto Ricans have maintained a clear sense of distinctiveness in the face of direct and indirect pressures on their identity. After gaining sovereignty over Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898, the United States undertook a sustained campaign to ""Americanize"" the island. Despite 50 years of active Americanization and another 40 years of continued United States sovereignty over the island, Puerto Ricans retain a sense of themselves as distinctly and proudly Puerto Rican. This study examines the symbols of Puerto Rican identity, and their use in the complex politics of the island. It shows that identity is dynamic, it is experienced differently by individuals across Puerto Rican society, and that the key symbols of Puerto Rican identity have not remained static over time. Through the study of Puerto Rico, the book investigates and challenges the widely-heard argument that the inevitable result of the export of U.S. mass media and consumer culture throughout the world is the weakening of cultural identities in receiving societies. The book develops the idea that external pressure on collective identity may strengthen that identity rather than, as is often assumed, diminish it.

                        <p>""Explores how local political elites have shaped Puerto Rican identity during almost a century of US involvement. Traces Island's political trajectory in its relations with US (pt. 1), and reproduces verbatim interviews with selected political leaders to identify elements that contribute to Puerto Ricans' sense of nationhood (pt. 2). Concludes that, despite pervasiveness of US cultural norms and the pressure to assimilate, Puerto Rican identity remains resilient to this day (pt. 3)""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.

Statistical Fluid Mechanics - Vol 1: Mechanics Of Turbulence,"['A. S. Monin', 'A. M. Yaglom']","This book, originally published in Moscow in 1965, is of interest to a wide scientific and technical audience, including geophysicists, meteorologists, aerodynamicists, chemical, mechanical, and civil engineers—in short, all interested in the fundamental problems of flow, mass, and heat transfer. The authors deal with the theory of hydrodynamic instability and the development of turbulence, the application of dimensional analysis, and the theory of similarity to turbulent flow in pipes, ducts, and boundary layers, as well as free turbulence. They discuss semiempirical theories of turbulence, develop the similarity theory for turbulence in nonhomogeneous media, and present Lagrangian characteristics of turbulence and the theory of turbulent diffusion. Every effort has been made to present a wealth of experimental material; a large number of examples are drawn from physics of the atmosphere, permitting a generalization of results beyond that which can be obtained in the laboratory. Considerable attention has been given to Kolmogorov's theory of the local structure of developed turbulence and to the theory of turbulence in stratified media.

Philip Of Spain,['Henry Kamen'],"This book, published four hundred years after Philip's death, is the first full-scale biography of the king. Placing him within the social, cultural, religious and regional context of his times, it presents a startling new picture of his character and reign. Drawing on Philip's unpublished correspondence and on many other archival sources, Henry Kamen reveals much about Philip the youth, the man, the husband, the father, the frequently troubled Christian and the king. Kamen finds that Philip was a cosmopolitan prince whose extensive experience of northern Europe broadened his cultural imagination and tastes, whose staunchly conservative ideas were far from being illiberal and fanatical, whose religious attitudes led him to accept a practical coexistence with Protestants and Jews, and whose support for Las Casas and other defenders of the Indians in America helped determine government policy. Shedding completely new light on most aspects of Philip's private life and, in consequence, on his public actions, this book is the definitive portrayal of Philip II."

Anthology Of Modern Chinese Poetry,['Michelle Yeh'],"This book-the first comprehensive anthology in English of modern Chinese poetry-presents more than three hundred poems by sixty-six poets from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the poems are translated from the original Chinese into modern-day English, and many are introduced to the English-speaking world for the first time. The poems, which span the period from the 1910s to the present, represent the three watersheds in modern Chinese poetry: the early years, before the civil war and Communist rule halted serious literary pursuits; the Taiwan phase, from the 1950s to the 1970s, when the vernacular became the new poetic medium and broadened the scope of poetic expression; and the post-1970s, when avant-garde movements brought a resurgence of aesthetic consciousness and artistic experimentation. The anthology includes a lengthy introduction, biographical notes for each poet, and a select bibliography. 
<p>Michelle Yeh's introduction provides a critical analysis of the rise and development of modern Chinese poetry. She argues that the poetry can be viewed collectively as an original and imaginative reaction to the marginalization of poetry in the twentieth century by various historical, sociopolitical, and ideological forces, and it is in this framework that we can best understand the major debates and controversies in the history of modern Chinese poetry. Voices from the margin, the poems in this volume powerfully evoke the richness and complexity of modern Chinese society and culture.</p>"
Daily Life In Ancient Rome : The People And The City At The Height Of The Empire,['Jerome Carcopino'],"This classic book brings to life imperial Rome as it was during the second century A.D., the time of Trajan and Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, and Commodus. It was a period marked by lavish displays of wealth, a dazzling cultural mix, and the advent of Christianity. The splendor and squalor of the city, the spectacles, and the day's routines are reconstructed from an immense fund of archaeological evidence and from vivid descriptions by ancient poets, satirists, letter-writers, and novelists-from Petronius to Pliny the Younger. In a new Introduction, the eminent classicist Mary Beard appraises the book's enduring-and sometimes surprising-influence and its value for general readers and students. She also provides an up-to-date bibliographic essay.""Carcopino's pledge to his readers was to open up to them some traces of the world that lay underneath the grandeur that remains the public face of ancient Rome. . . .

Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric To Hellenistic Times (yale Nota Bene),['Thomas R. Martin'],"This compact, comprehensive, and generously illustrated history of ancient Greece takes us from the Stone Age roots of Greek civilization to the early Hellenistic period following the death of Alexander the Great. Designed for nonspecialist readers, it will be a welcome and needed resource for all who wish to learn about this important subject. Thomas Martin begins with a prehistory of late Stone Age activity that provides background for the conditions of later Greek life. He then describes the civilizations of the Minoans on the island of Crete and of their successors, the Mycenaeans, on the mainland; the Greek Dark Age and the Archaic Age; the Classical Age of Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.; the transformation of the kingdom of Macedonia into the greatest power in the Greek world; and the period after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C., when monarchies emerging from Alexander's fragmented empire once again came to dominate Greek history. The narrative integrates political, military, social, and cultural history, with a focus on the development of the Greek city-state in the eighth to fourth centuries B.C. and on the society, literature, and architecture of Athens in its Golden Age. The book, which includes useful timelines, maps, plans, and photographs, was adapted from and may be cross-referenced with the historical overview of Greece that is part of the multimedia interactive database Perseus: Interactive Sources and Studies on Ancient Greece, versions 1.0 and 2.0.

Unspoken rules: sexual orientation and women's human rights,['International Gay And Lesbian Human Rights Commission'],"This courageous and groundbreaking book documents human rights violations against women in 30 countries around the world and discusses the strategies that lesbian activists and other human rights advocates have employed to challenge such oppression. Placing lesbian rights within the framework of the broader struggle for women's human rights, this book demonstrates how women's rights and lesbian rights are linked in substantive ways. Both issues highlight how human rights distinctions between the private and public, as well as reluctance to address female sexuality, have perpetuated violations of women and kept them invisible. Furthermore, the defence of lesbian rights is integral to the defence of women's right to determine their own sexuality, to work at the jobs they prefer and to live as they choose with women, men, children or alone. Homophobia, it is argued, is used as a tool to keep women in line and force them to accept their society's assigned gender roles and limitations."
Libraries In The Ancient World,['Lionel Casson'],"This delightful book tells the story of ancient libraries from their very beginnings, when ""books"" were clay tablets and writing was a new phenomenon. Renowned classicist Lionel Casson takes us on a lively tour, from the royal libraries of the most ancient Near East, through the private and public libraries of Greece and Rome, down to the first Christian monastic libraries. To the founders of the first public libraries of the Greek world goes the credit for creating the prototype of today's library buildings and the science of organizing books in them. 
<p>Casson recounts the development of ancient library buildings, systems, holdings, and patrons, addressing questions on a wide variety of topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the connection between the rise in education and literacy and the growth of libraries?</li>
<li>Who contributed to the early development of public libraries, especially the great library at Alexandria?</li>
<li>What did ancient libraries include in their holdings?</li>
<li>How did ancient libraries acquire books?</li>
<li>What was the nature of publishing in the Greek and Roman world?</li>
<li>How did different types of users (royalty, scholars, religious figures) and different kinds of ""books"" (tablets, scrolls, codices) affect library arrangements?</li>
<li>How did Christianity transform the nature of library holdings?</li>
</ul>
Just as a library yields unexpected treasures to a meandering browser, this entertaining book offers to its perusers the surprising history of the rise and development of ancient libraries-a fascinating story never told before.

By placing Kubrick in a historical and theoretical context, this study is a reliable guide into--and out of--Stanley Kubrick's cinematic maze."
Word And Sentence Prosody In Serbocroatian,"['Lehiste, Ilse.']","This extensive field study and comprehensive analysis of existing scholarship provides a solid basis for interpreting the peculiar and much-debated Serbocroatian accentuation. Although addressed to Slavists in particular, the book also opens possibilities for linguists investigating the ways in which ""accent"" can be defined and utilized in various linguistic systems.
<p>The authors have been working together on Serbocroatian accentuation for more than two decades. The book summarizes their earlier findings and adds a wealth of new materials. It contains the results of thousands of spectrographic measurements of a rich corpus of data concerning word accentuation and sentence intonation, as well as the results of a series of listening tests that clarify the nature of the distinction between so-called falling and rising accents.</p>
<p>Because Serbocroatian is one of the IndoEuropean languages with the most complex prosodic patterns, it is extremely important for comparative linguistics and also highly interesting from a typological viewpoint. The interplay of word accents and sentence intonation has offered an especially attractive subject of study for scholars.</p>
<p>This book surveys the results of their work and reviews the rich variety of opinions expressed so far. A concluding section focuses on the authors own view, which takes into account not only the invariant elements in the relation between so-called falling and rising accents, but also the variation connected with the syllabic structure of the word and its position in the sentence and with the regional origin of the speaker.</p>
<p>Ilse Lehiste is Professor of Linguistics, Ohio State University. Pavle Iviã is a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and a retired professor of the University of Belgrade.

A history of Yale's School of Medicine: passing torches to others,"['Burrow, Gerard N. , 1933-2013']","This fascinating book tells the story of the Yale University School of Medicine, tracing its history from its origins in 1810 (when it had four professors and 37 students) to its present status as one of the world's outstanding medical schools. Written by a former dean of the medical school, the book focuses on the important relationship of the medical school to the university, which has long operated under the precept that one should heal the body as well as the soul.
<p>Dr. Gerard Burrow recounts events surrounding the beginnings of the medical school, the very perilous times it experienced in the middle and late nineteenth century, and its revitalization, rapid growth, and evolution throughout the twentieth century. He describes the colorful individuals involved with the school and shows how social upheavals — wars, the Depression, boom periods, social activism, and the like — affected the school. The picture he paints is that of an institution that was at times unmanageable and under-funded, that often had troubled relationships with the New Haven community and its major hospital, but that managed to triumph over these difficulties and flourish. Today Yale University School of Medicine is a center for excellence. Dr. Burrow draws on the themes recurrent in its rich past to offer suggestions about its future.</p>

He is currently President and CEO of the Sea Research Foundation, which encompasses the Mystic Aquarium and the Institute for Exploration.</p>"
The Calculating Machines (die Rechenmaschinen): Their History And Development (charles Babbage Institute Reprint),['Ernst Martin'],"This final volume in the Charles Babbage Institute Reprint series brings to light an extremely rare German account of the calculating machine industry in the first quarter of this century when the use of office machines became common in American and European business, government, and science.
<p>Ernst Martin wrote <i>Die Rechenmaschinen</i> to address the issues and questions that the public had raised about the many calculating devices that were appearing on the market in the early 1920s. His little book is, in fact, a developmental history of calculating machines in catalog form - invaluable for collectors of old machines. The introduction describes the seven major types of machines that had been produced by 1925. The corpus of the book consists of a running list of specific calculating machines, arranged by the date the device was first patented or produced.</p>"
Kerner: The Conflict Of Intangible Rights,"['Bill Barnhart', 'Gene Schlickman']","This first biography of Otto Kerner traces the career of a major figure in Illinois politics and examines his precipitous descent from public hero to convicted felon.
<p>As Cook County judge, Kerner reformed Illinois adoption procedure; as a two-term Democratic governor, he promoted economic development, education, mental health services, and equal access to jobs and housing; as a federal appeals court judge, he bucked the law-and-order tide of the late 1960s and protected the rights of the accused. His entire public career reflected his experiences as a decorated combat officer in World War II.</p>
<p>Kerner achieved fame as chair of the National Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission), which remains a milestone in America's struggle for racial harmony. An eloquent prophet of the grave consequences of racism in America's cities, Kerner articulated the commission's principal finding that ""our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white--separate and unequal.""</p>
<p>Kerner's achievements, however, were eclipsed by his conviction on federal charges of mail fraud, bribery, perjury, and income tax evasion tied to his dealings in stock of an Illinois racetrack enterprise. Arguing that Kerner's incarceration related less to his misdeeds than to the zeal of federal investigators in attacking corruption in Illinois, Bill Barnhart and Gene Schlickman reveal how the prosecution of the popular ex-governor deepened the penetration of the federal government into state and local politics and coarsened attitudes toward public service.</p>
<p> This broad-based study sets Kerner's life against a backdrop of pivotal events and issues in American politics over six decades. An absorbing biography of a prominent and arguably tragic public figure, Kerner presents a cautionary tale about the strengths and weaknesses of the American political character and the capriciousness of political acclaim and denigration.</p>"
"Chase, Chance, And Creativity: The Lucky Art Of Novelty",['James H. Austin'],"This first book by the author of <i>Zen and the Brain</i> examines the role of chance in the creative process. James Austin tells a personal story of the ways in which persistence, chance, and creativity interact in biomedical research; the conclusions he reaches shed light on the creative process in any field.<br>
<br>
Austin shows how, in his own investigations, unpredictable events shaped the outcome of his research and brought about novel results. He then goes beyond this story of serendipity to propose a new classification of the varieties of chance, drawing on his own research and examples from the history of science—including the famous accidents that led Fleming to the discovery of penicillin. Finally, he explores the nature of the creative process, considering not only the environmental and neurophysiological correlates of creativity but also the role of intuition in both scientific discoveries and spiritual quests. This updated MIT Press paperback edition includes a new introduction and recent material on medical research, creativity, and spirituality."

To quote Tom Moon: ""Anything that could hurt the enemy and aid the Allies was fair game. The rules of warfare were to be abolished for this organization."" ""This organization"" was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, which President Franklin D.

The Cybernetics Group,['Steve Joshua Heims'],"This is the engaging story of a moment of transformation in the human sciences, a detailed account of a remarkable group of people who met regularly from 1946 to 1953 to explore the possibility of using scientific ideas that had emerged in the war years (cybernetics, information theory, computer theory) as a basis for interdisciplinary alliances. The Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, as they came to be called, included such luminaries as Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann, Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, Warren McCulloch, Walter Pitts, Kurt Lewin, F. S. C. Northrop, Molly Harrower, and Lawrence Kubie, who thought and argued together about such topics as insanity, vision, circular causality, language, the brain as a digital machine, and how to make wise decisions.
<p>Heims, who met and talked with many of the participants, portrays them not only as thinkers but as human beings. His account examines how the conduct and content of research are shaped by the society in which it occurs and how the spirit of the times, in this case a mixture of postwar confidence and cold-war paranoia, affected the thinking of the cybernetics group. He uses the meetings to explore the strong influence elite groups can have in establishing connections and agendas for research and provides a firsthand took at the emergence of paradigms that were to become central to the new fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science.</p>
<p>In his joint biography of John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener, Heims offered a challenging interpretation of the development of recent American science and technology. Here, in this group portrait of an important generation of American intellectuals, Heims extends that interpretation to a broader canvas, in the process paying special attention to the two iconoclastic figures, Warren McCulloch and Gregory Bateson, whose ideas on the nature of the mind/brain and on holism are enjoying renewal today.</p>"

Modernism In Dispute: Art Since The Forties (modern Art Practices And Debates),"['Jonathan Harris', 'Francis Frascina', 'Dr. Charles Harrison', 'Paul Wood']","This is the final volume in a series of four books about art and its interpretation from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth. The books seek to explain the most important issues confronting any study of modern art, without attempting exhaustive coverage. They present a range of approaches characteristic of current art-historical debates. This fourth volume focuses on art since the 1930s, the main emphasis being on the period since the Second World War. The first chapter, 'Modernism and culture in the USA, 1930-1960', examines the ideological interests that governed the predominant Modernist account of the period. It establishes a different perspective by considering the connection between 'historical' and 'theoretical' debates in terms of the relationships between art, culture and society in the USA. Although the two focal points are the 1930s and the years after the Second World War, questions of cultural value and power in capitalist societies are also discussed in the context of parallels to be found in conditions during the 1990s. Chapter 2, 'The politics of representation', examines debates about the practices of art, art criticism and curatorial validation since the 1940s. These practices - considered as representations of ideas, values and beliefs - were produced in a period dominated by the Cold War consensus. A major issue is whether this consensus was ruptured during the late 1960s by a counter-culture characterized by, for example, feminism and the anti-Vietnam War movement. While questions about the function of art and culture are mostly located in the specific social and political conditions existing between the 1940s and the early 1970s, issues about the legacy of this period are also considered. The final chapter, 'Modernity and Modernism reconsidered', examines the high Modernism of the 1960s and goes on to review movements such as Minimal Art, Land Art and Conceptual Art which continued or contested that tradition. It also co"
Roland Barthes: A Biography,['Louis-jean Calvet'],"This is the first biography of Roland Barthes - one of the most important European intellectuals of the postwar years. In a lively and engaging account of Barthes's life and work, Calvet follows the brilliant semiotician from his provincial origins to his sudden death in 1980. He describes Barthes's move to Paris as a child, where he lived with his mother in modest surroundings and constant hardship. He argues that the experience of having his academic prospects ruined by his illness at an early age remained a thorn in Barthes's flesh: until the end of his life his relationship with the academic world was never free of bitterness, even resentment. Calvet retraces his years in Paris, Bucharest and Alexandria after the war. During this period Barthes gained access to intellectual circles and experienced his decisive encounter with modern linguistics, particularly with ""semiotics,"" which he helped to establish as a discipline through his work on everyday myths, fashion, and literature. Calvet discusses the whole range of Barthes's work as a critic and literary theorist, and demonstrates his tremendous importance and influence in the second half of the twentieth century. Thoughtful and sensitive, this book provides a detailed portrait of Barthes's life, and a vivid reconstruction of the intellectual culture of postwar France. It will be welcomed by student sand researchers in literature, cultural studies, French Studies, and by anyone interested in the life and work of Roland Barthes."
The Selected Correspondence Of Aaron Copland,['Aaron Copland'],"This is the first book devoted to the correspondence of composer Aaron Copland, covering his life from age eight to eighty-seven. The chronologically arranged collection includes letters to many significant figures in American twentieth-century music as well as Copland’s friends, family, teachers, and colleagues. Selected for readability, interest, and the light they cast upon the composer’s thoughts and career, the letters are carefully annotated and each published in its entirety.<br>
Copland was a gifted and natural letter writer who revealed much more about himself in his letters than in formal writings in which he was conscious of his position as spokesman for modern music. The collected letters offer insights into his music, personality, and ideas, along with fascinating glimpses into the lives of such other well-known musicians as Leonard Bernstein, Carlos Chávez, William Schuman, and Virgil Thomson."
The Biomass Spectrum,"['S. R. Kerr', 'L. M. Dickie', 'Lloyd M. Dickie', 'Stephen R. Kerr']","This is the first book to present a synthesis of the biomass spectrum approach to studying dynamic ecosystems.
<p>There is a need in ecological system analysis to formulate well-defined observations on scales of aggregation suited to the purpose of investigation. Over the last three decades the authors have developed the idea of plotting the densities of the biomass of all organisms in a community by body-size classes, in the form of a biomass spectrum. This has revealed a hierarchical pattern of serial interactions and supported the development of an underlying theory of predator-prey energy transfer. This in turn has led to a new understanding of the self-organizing properties of ecological production systems.</p>
<p>In recent years the observation, theory, and requisite mathematical underpinnings have reached a point where a comprehensive synthesis of the biomass spectrum in terms of energy flows and application to ecological production systems has become possible. In this book the authors describe the potential of this approach for understanding the dynamical processes underlying production and its exploitation, especially in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p> In this first comprehensive synthesis the authors demonstrate the powers of explanation of the biomass approach, in terms of both the internal dynamics of individual organisms and of populations, allowing predictions to be made as to how the whole aquatic community reacts to measurable features of the external environment. The authors emphasize the practical examples to using this approach in terms of the effects of heavy fishing on natural communities of both marine and freshwater organisms. Their conclusions offer hope that a practical and effective system of remedial action can be applied to exploited natural ecosystems.</p>"

Fratricide in the Holy Land: a psychoanalytic view of the Arab-Israeli conflict,"['Falk, Avner.']","This is the first English-language book ever to apply psychoanalytic knowledge to the understanding of the most intractable international struggle in our world today—the Arab-Israeli conflict. Two ethnic groups fight over a single territory that both consider to be theirs by historical right—essentially a rational matter. But close historical examination shows that the two parties to this tragic conflict have missed innumerable opportunities for a rational partition of the territory between them and for a permanent state of peace and prosperity rather than perennial bloodshed and misery.
<p> Falk suggests that a way to understand and explain such irrational matters is to examine the unconscious aspects of the conflict. He examines large-group psychology, nationalism, group narcissism, psychogeography, the Arab and Israeli minds, and suicidal terrorism, and he offers psychobiographical studies of Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat, two key players in this tragic conflict today.</p>"
"A History Of Fascism, 1914–1945",['Stanley G. Payne'],"This is the first full history of fascism - as a force and as a phenomenon - in Europe and elsewhere between the world wars. This history encompasses all the major fascist movements, as well as other forms of authoritarian nationalism, and provides in-depth analyses of these movements, the interpretative problems they pose, and previous interpretations of them. Stanley G. Payne interprets fascism as a form of revolutionary ultranationalism - a program for national rebirth based on a primarily vitalist philosophy, extreme elitism, mass mobilization, the promotion of violence, and military virtues. He traces this phenomenon through the history of ideas, previous political movements, and the events of World War I. Though his focus is chiefly on Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, he also gives detailed attention to the Romanian Iron Guard, Franco's Spain, Japan, and protofascist movements around the globe. In view of widespread speculation about the return of fascism to Europe and the Afro-Asian World, this work is especially timely. However, Payne presents a powerful case for viewing fascism as a unique ""epochal phenomenon."" Conversely, he treats significant individual features of fascism as inherent aspects of revolutionary movements and nationalist dictatorships, with every likelihood of reappearing in new and different forms."

"The Making Of The French Episcopate, 1589-1661",['Joseph Bergin'],"This major work, written by one of the leading historians of France's ancien regime, is the first in-depth study of the French upper clergy during the key period of the Catholic Reformation following the Council of Trent. In describing the creation, character, and role of these early French bishops, it also sheds light on social mobility, education, the career patterns and prospects of particular groups, the workings of patronage and clientage networks, and the wider dimensions of royal policy and patronage at this time. Joseph Bergin begins by analysing the structures of the French church and the process by which individuals were nominated and confirmed as bishops. He then presents a collective profile of these bishops in terms of their social and geographical origins, educational attainments, and pre-episcopal careers. Bergin examines royal patronage in relation to episcopal office, tracing the successive pressures with which the crown had to deal in the wider social and political world. In particular he shows how the crown painfully and gradually recovered control of church patronage after the low point of the religious wars, reducing the grip of the nobility on large numbers of dioceses. He also examines how reforming pressures were brought to bear on the crown to appoint bishops who met the standards of the counter-reformation church and how the crown became increasingly in tune with these reformist pressures. He concludes by explaining particular features of the French episcopate within a wider European context. The book, the result of years of research in French and Italian archives, includes an extensive biographical dictionary that will make it an invaluable reference for all French historians of the period."

Poems Of André Breton: A Bilingual Anthology,['André Breton'],"This newly revised edition (with additional poems) is the single most comprehensive critical edition of Breton's poems available in English. Other editions may claim to be ""comprehensive"", but none come close to the range of poems presented in this edition. Surrealist scholar Jean-Pierre Cauvin and, once again, Breton scholar Mary Ann Caws translate and edit this title with critical introductions, prefaces, commentary, bibliography, and notes. This title has remained elusive and expensive in the used market, as students and scholars have snapped up the few copies ever available through any book search. Like him or hate him, few have had as important an impact on 20th century artistic thought and culture as Breton and his Surrealist movement."
Revolt Against Chivalry: Jessie Daniel Ames And The Women's Campaign Against Lynching,['Jacquelyn Dowd Hall'],"This newly updated edition connects the past with the present, using the Clarence Thomas hearings -and their characterization by Thomas as a ""high-tech lynching""- to examine the links between white supremacy and the sexual abuse of black women, and the difficulty of forging an antiracist movement against sexual violence.<br>
 <i>Revolt Against Chivalry</i> is the account of how Jesse Daniel Ames -and the antilynching campaign she led- fused the causes of social feminism and racial justice in the South during the 1920s and 1930s.<br>
 The book traces Ames's political path from suffragism to militant antiracism and provides a detailed description of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, which served through the 1930s as the chief expression of antilynching sentiment in the white South.<br>
 Revolt Against Chivalry is also a biography of Ames herself: it shows how Ames connected women's opposition to violence with their search for influence and self-definition, thereby leading a revolt against chivalry which was part of both sexual and racial emancipation.<br>
 
<p>A superb book, a beautifully crafted biography, and one that tells a highly important story about race, sex and gender, violence, and the law in the twentieth-century South. (Suzanne Lebsock, Rutgers University)<br>

The Equality Complex: Lesbians In Therapy : A Guide To Anti-oppressive Practice (women On Women),['Val Young'],"This original and timely book breaks through the conceptual barriers between lesbians and therapy, and directs the focus of attention to real experiences of one-to-one practice. The first guide to therapy to be written from the perspectives of lesbian clients, it is also the first to demonstrate the fundamental equalities elements of the National and Scottish Vocational Qualifications standards (NVQs/SVQs) in counselling. Anti-oppressive principles are applied throughout. The conventional practitioner-teacher training text format is purposefully inverted, and creates the more empowering atmosphere of an experiential workshop or a self-directed training course. Astute observations by contributors of disempowering and heterosexist therapy methods or attitudes, and equally of good practice, are followed by an introduction to the anti-oppressive approach and a series of counselling examples, including supervision. This casework develops spontaneously from themes volunteered by the contributors, with each session including sub-textual comments by both client and practitioner. Theoretical discussion is kept to a minimum. This accessible book is an ideal guide for all women who perceive therapy as a resource for exploring the nature of sexual identity during periods of personal and social transitions."
The Specter Of Dido: Spenser And Virgilian Epic,"['Watkins, John , 1960-']","This pathbreaking book dismantles the stereotype of Spenser as one who blurs earlier epic traditions. John Watkins's examinations of Spenser's major poetry reveal a poet keenly attuned to dissonances among his classical, medieval, and early modern sources. By bringing Virgil into a dialogue with Chaucer, Ariosto, and Tasso, Spenser transformed the most patriarchal of genres into a vehicle for praising the Virgin Queen.<br>"

The Fight Against Unemployment: Macroeconomic Analysis From The Centre For European Policy Studies (centre For European Policy Studies (ceps) Series),['Richard Layard'],"This second CEPS annual addresses the crucial problem of persistent high unemployment in Europe, despite recent years of economic recovery. Recurring themes in the discussion of possible solutions are the relative importance of aggregate demand, labor-market flexibility, capital formation, and the organization of work-time in order to achieve work-sharing.
<p>The report of the CEPS Macroeconomic Policy Group included in this volume identifies a mix of macroeconomic strategies that could gradually boost output while containing inflation, bringing it back to the five percent level of the late 1970s. Contributors are Franco Modigliani (MIT), Marie Monti (Bocconi University), Jacques Dréze, Herbert Giersch (Kiel), and Richard Layard.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Franz (University of Stuttgart) provides strong evidence that contractionary policies aimed at combating inflation will mean higher unemployment in the long run. David Metcalf (London School of Economics) surveys the recent literature on labor-market rigidities in the European economies, focusing on problems of aggregate and relative wage flexibility and analyzing the relations to bargaining structure, the degree of cooperativism and labor-market legislation.</p>
<p>The issue of work-sharing as a means of promoting employment is discussed by Jacques Dréze (Université Catholique de Louvain), who sees this as a method of achieving a more efficient allocation of regular jobs between ""insiders"" in the labor market and new entrants. He points out various ways - such as trading jobs between workers of different ages, sharing jobs, and trading hours for jobs - that work might realistically be shared.</p>

East-west Migration: The Alternatives,"['Richard Layard', 'Olivier Jean Blanchard', 'Rudiger Dornbusch', 'Paul Krugman']","This sequel to <i>Reform in Eastern Europe</i> is a report on one of the most pressing issues for countries with economies in transition and their neighbors. Focusing on the problem of East-West migration, the authors clearly delineate and promote the notion of European free trade and capital flows as a means of raising productivity and increasing worker stability in the East and of reducing income gaps between countries.
<p>As economists who have been deeply and consistently involved in the recent upheavals in the East, the authors are in a position to take a well-informed stance on the economic and social dislocations that are occurring. They first outline the problem and recommend that Europe begin to admit primary migrants and that the US increase its quota. They then look at migration statistics from previous eras to predict equivalent levels in the near future and take into account the long-run and short-run effects of migration in the US and Europe. They conclude with a detailed discussion of ""the best defense of all,"" economic progress, and lay out the necessary conditions for free trade, investment, and aid.</p>

"Money, Growth, And Stability",['Frank Hahn'],"This sequel to Frank Hahn's <i>Equilibrium and Macroeconomics</i> presents his theoretical work published over the past thirty years. The twentyone contributions have been selected on the basis of their relevance to current economic debate, and they comprise some of Hahn's most widely cited and influential essays.
<p>Organized in five parts - Money, Non-Walrasian Equilibria, Stability, Growth, and Miscellaneous - most of the essays concentrate on monetary theory and economic dynamics (or stability). In the first instance, Hahn shows that classical Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium theory cannot be used for monetary theory. A reconstruction of this theory turns out to have some surprising welfare economics implications. Concerning dynamics, Hahn's main preoccupations are with price dynamics that allow trading at ""false"" prices and with the stability of growth equilibrium with heterogeneous capital goods, which remains important to current theorizing on rational expectations equilibria.</p>
<p>The remaining essays cover a variety of topics such as the influence of uncertainty on savings and excess capacity in imperfect competition. The book also includes an introduction by Hahn commenting on each essay, and his Jevons Lecture, ""In Praise of Economic Theory.""</p>

"Radical Politics In West Bengal (studies In Communism, Revisionism, And Revolution)",['Marcus F. Franda'],"This study is the result of the author's personal involvement with Bengal over an extended period of time. In an attempt to build an understanding of the forces impinging on the communist movement in Bengal, Professor Franda focuses on the communists as political calculators and on the environment (regional, national, and international) in which they have their origins. While the scope of the study includes the Marxist Left in Bengal, more attention is paid to the communists because of their central role in developing organizational models and strategies for all leftist parties in the Bengali-speaking region.
<p>The principal concern of the author is to trace the extent to which the Communist and Marxist Left parties have been able to modify the basic political alignments that came into being with Independence. He concludes that the failure of the communists in Bengal ultimately stems from the failure of all of India's party leaders to devise a means for bringing about fundamental political transformations in Bengal and in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>This book will be useful to those interested in Indian politics and, more generally, to students of revolution, radical movements, political development, communist studies, and Asian politics.</p>

Truth From Trash: How Learning Makes Sense (complex Adaptive Systems),['Chris Thornton'],"This study of learning in autonomous agents offers a bracing intellectual adventure. Chris Thornton makes the compelling claim that learning is not a passive discovery operation but an active process involving creativity on the part of the learner. Although theorists of machine learning tell us that all learning methods contribute some form of bias and thus involve a degree of creativity, Thornton carries the idea much further. He describes an incremental process, recursive relational learning, in which the results of one learning step serve as the basis for the next. Very high-level recodings are then substantially the creative artifacts of the learner's own processing. Lower-level recodings are more ""objective"" in that their properties are more severely constrained by the source data. Thornton sees consciousness as a process at the outer fringe of relational learning, just prior to the onset of creativity. According to this view, we cannot assume consciousness to be an exclusively human phenomenon, but rather the expected feature of any cognitive mechanism able to engage in extended flights of relational learning.
<p> Thornton presents key background material in an entertaining manner, using extensive mental imagery and a minimum of mathematics. Anecdotes and dialogue add to the text's informality.</p>"

John Singer Sargent: The Later Portraits,"['Richard Ormond', 'Elaine Kilmurray']","This sumptuous book is the third volume of the definitive catalogue raisonné of the work of the American painter John Singer Sargent (1856-1925). Comprising over two hundred portraits and portrait sketches in oil and watercolor painted between 1900 and the artist's death in 1925, this book completes the trilogy of portrait volumes. The catalogued works have been grouped into two chronological sections, each with an introduction that sets the particular group in context. There is also a section of undated portraits and an appendix listing previously unrecorded works. Each work is documented in depth: entries include traditional data about the painting or watercolor; details of the work's provenance, exhibition history, and bibliography; a short biography of the sitter; a discussion of the circumstances in which the work was created; and a critical discussion of its subject matter, style, and significance in Sargent's career. Most of the works are reproduced in color. There is also an illustrated inventory of Sargent's studio props and accessories and a cross-referenced checklist of the portraits in which they appear.

"The Republic Of Denial: Press, Politics, And Public Life",['Michael Janeway'],"This thought-provoking book offers the most insightful critique of the relationship among the press, politics, and public life in decades. Disdain for politics today in the United States is almost universal. Condemnation of the press is rampant as well. Until we understand the modern condition of politics and journalism-and the cultural context in which they interact-says Michael Janeway, there's small hope of either recovering its standing. Drawing on years of experience at the top levels of the news business and in politics and government, Janeway provides an integrated, insider's critique of the profound changes in each of these professional worlds, showing how trends in each have contributed to deepening public alienation.
<p>From its confident post-World War Two era of world leadership, the United States entered a difficult period of turbulence and reversals in the 1960s and 1970s. With wit, clarity, and an eye for offbeat cultural indicators, Janeway examines the full complex of forces that have corroded our press, politics, and public life since then. The result, he argues, is a loss of substance and structure in public life as well as citizen connection to it, a vacuum all too easily filled by political entertainers, shallow coverage of ""character,"" and-engulfing the nation in convulsive crisis for a year of its history-the politics of scandal.</p>
<p>None of today's proposed remedies for the failings of our press or politcal system is adequate, Janeway argues, for none take full account of the integral relationship between the two spheres. In the absence of recognition of its buried democratic crisis, Janeway concludes, the United States has become a ""republic of denial.""</p>"
Innovation In New Communities,"['Miller, Brown , 1940-']","This timely study of innovative potentials in new communities (defined in the context of this study as ""projects involving the creation of an urban environment rather than the development of limited use projects in predetermined or existing urban patterns"") represents a solid and wide-ranging contribution to the literature on town and city building. At a moment when national and urban growth strategy is crystallizing into a major policy thrust, the authors present abundant and persuasive evidence that new communities can be planned and developed in a manner that accommodates changing technologies and social requirements more efficiently than existing communities.
<p>This book provides a resume of the fundamental opportunities in new communities, a summary of pertinent social trends, and an unusually illuminating list of innovations. It also addresses issues of population distribution and growth, goals of new communities, and possible future way-of-life scenarios. Drawing on extensive research of progress in both public and private sectors and on authoritative technological forecasting sources, the study succinctly describes a wealth of promising systems—in transportation, communications, energy, and waste management, and in public services programs such as health, education, and institutional control.</p>
<p>Following a survey of current public policy and legislation, the authors construct a financial model to test the feasibility of introducing public service innovations at various stages of community development. The principles and planning determinants derived from this investigation are being applied to the design of a 6000-acre site in eastern Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The final part of the book examines taxonomies of community macroforms and of the smaller-scale service areas manifested in many of the more influential recent new towns and cities. Six informative appendixes buttress the main body of work. These range from a description of multiservice cable communication capacities to macroform prototypes and comparative community scales.</p>

The Understructure Of Writing For Film And Television,"['Ben Brady', 'Lance Lee']","This unique, comprehensive introduction to screenwriting offers practical advice for the beginning writer, whether college student or freelancer. Based on their experience as professional writers and as teachers in a large, successful screenwriting program at California State University, Northridge, the authors provide a progression of assignments at manageable screenwriting lengths for beginners. They lead students through development of a premise, treatment, stepsheet, and, finally, miniscreenplay--essential elements in writing a longer script.
<p>A major feature of the text is the use of many example scenes from contemporary and classic American films, such as On the Waterfront, Kramer vs. Kramer, The Godfather, The Graduate, Tootsie, and more. Other scenes are drawn from international films and dramatic literature. The criticism of these scenes invites students to develop their own comparative models, while simultaneously providing exposure to the central analytical terms of good dramatic writing.</p>
<p>The authors also place screenwriting within the larger tradition of dramatic writing in order to put the beginning writer in touch with the wealth of art, experience, and practical ideas the drama contains. They provide an up-to-date, practical discussion of marketing and copywriting a screenplay, with addresses of relevant professional societies. Most importantly, they never offer an ill-advised shortcut or restrict students to only one way of thinking about a character, situation, or scene. In The Understructure of Writing for Film &amp; Television, the student's thought and creativity are central.</p>"

Most of the studies described deal with the mouse embryo, since laboratory maintenance of mice is convenient and the genetics of the mouse are well established.<p>One of the underlying themes throughout the chapters is the programming of events in early embryogenesis. The activation of new genes, which begins early in embryogenesis, complements preexisting gene action and helps to provide the developing embryo with the machinery necessary for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and with the enzymes required for intermediary metabolism (maintenance gene products). The synthesis of differentiative gene products, those which irreversibly route cells along different developmental pathways, must also be taking place prior to, or at, implantation. These new gene products, and what we know of their functions, are discussed in detail. Another, less understood area explored is the role of the genes that initiate differentiation in early embryonic cells. Recent biological studies have revealed that a relationship exists between the position of a cell relative to other cells in the embryo and its ultimate fate; however, embryologists have yet to explain how the microenvironment can trigger a cell to embark on a specific course of differentiation. Various methods used in investigating this problem-such as microanalytic techniques or the study of similar phenomena in teratocarcinomas-are described, and the relationships between embryos and teratocarcinomas are thoroughly considered. A chapter on T mutations in the mouse has been included because of the potential of this system for contributing to our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in development of the mammalian embryo. The use of recent immunological, histochemical, and biochemical studies of cell surface properties as markers of genetic programming during embryogenesis is described; and a chapter on the possible role of viruses in the control of embryonic development completes the volume. In summary, the editor states, the chapters in this monograph demonstrate that mammalian embryologists are now equipped with morphological, biochemical, and molecular biological markers of early embryonic development and differentiation. Model systems are available for testing ideas of genetic and epigenetic control mechanisms. With proper use of these resources, our understanding of mammalian embryogenesis could be revolutionized within the next decade.</p>"
"The Serbs: History, Myth And The Destruction Of Yugoslavia",['Mr. Tim Judah'],"This wide-ranging, scholarly, and highly readable account opens with the windswept fortresses of medieval kings and a battle lost more than six centuries ago that still profoundly influences the Serbs. Judah describes the idea of 'Serbdom' that sustained them during centuries of Ottoman rule, the days of glory during the First World War, and the genocide against them during the Second. He examines the tenuous ethnic balance fashioned by Tito and its unraveling after his death. And he reveals how Slobodan Milosevic, later to become president, used a version of history to drive his people to nationalist euphoria. Judah details the way Milosevic prepared for war and provides gripping eyewitness accounts of wartime horrors: the burning villages and 'ethnic cleansing,' the ignominy of the siege of Sarajevo, and the columns of bedraggled Serb refugees, cynically manipulated and then abandoned once the dream of a Greater Serbia was lost. This first in-depth account of life behind Serbian lines is not an apologia but a scrupulous explanation of how the people of a modernizing European state could become among the most reviled of the century. Rejecting the stereotypical image of a blood-thirsty nation, Judah makes the Serbs comprehensible by placing them within the context of their history and their hopes.

                        <p>In a wide-ranging, scholarly, and highly readable account which begins with a battle lost more than six centuries ago -- Judah examines the tenuous ethnic balance fashioned by Tito and its unraveling after his death. Presenting the first in-depth account of life behind Serbian lines, Judah also provides a scrupulous explanation of how the people of a modern European state could become among the most reviled of the century.

The Language Complexity Game (artificial Intelligence),['Eric Sven Ristad'],"This work elucidates the structure and complexity of human language in terms of the mathematics of information and computation. It strengthens Chomsky's early work on the mathematics of language, with the advantages of a better understanding of language and a more precise theory of structural complexity.
<p>Ristad argues that language is the process of constructing linguistic representations from the forms produced by other cognitive modules and that this process is NP-complete.</p>
<p>This NP-completeness is defended with a phalanx of elegant and revealing proofs that rely only on the empirical facts of linguistic knowledge and on the uncontroverted assumption that these facts generalize in a reasonable manner. For this reason, these complexity results apply to all adequate linguistic theories and are the first to do so.</p>
<p>Eric Sven Ristad is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. He is the coauthor of <i>Computational Complexity and Natural Language.</i></p>

Cv Phonology: A Generative Theory Of The Syllable (linguistic Inquiry Monographs),"['George N. Clements', 'Samuel Jay Keyser']","This work introduces a new approach to syllable representation. It proposes an additional level of phonological representation, the CV-tier; which defines functional positions within the syllable. The first three chapters provide an explanation of and support far this new approach from a typologically varied selection of languages, including English, Turkish, Finnish, French, Spanish, and Danish.
<p>The last two chapters are devoted to an in-depth application of the theory of Klamath, showing that a radical simplification of the phonological rules of that language is made possible in terms of this new framework. The book constitutes the first full-scale phonological justification for the CV-tier.</p>"

Lagrangian Analysis And Quantum Mechanics: A Mathematical Structure Related To Asymptotic Expansions And The Maslov Index,"['Leray, Jean , 1906-']","This work might have been entitled <i>The Introduction of Planck's Constant into Mathematics,</i> in that it introduces quantum conditions in a purely mathematical way in order to remove the singularities that arise in obtaining approximations to solutions of complex differential equations.
<p>The book's first chapter develops the necessary mathematical apparatus: Fourier transforms, metaplectic and symplectic groups, the Maslov index, and lagrangian varieties. The second chapter orders Maslov's conceptions in a manner that avoids contraditions and creates step by step an essentially new structure-the lagrangian ayalysis.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly and strangely the last step requires the datum of a constant, which in applications to quantum mechanics is identified with Planck's constant. The final two chapters apply lagrangian analysis directly to the Schrödinger, the Klein-Gordon, and the Dirac equations. Magnetic field effects and even the Paschen-Back effect are taken into account.</p>
<p>Jean Leray-who has been professor at the Collège de France for the past thirty years-has made fundamental contributions to theoretical hydrodynamics, to the study of elliptic, hyperbolic, and analytic linear and nonlinear equations, and to algebraic topology and its applications to analysis. His motivations always had their origin in physical problems, except during World War II: As a prisoner of war in Germany for five years, he concealed his interest in mathematical applications by making fruitful investigations in the field of pure algebraic topology.</p>"
Thomas Cranmer: A Life,['Diarmaid Macculloch'],"Thomas Cranmer was the architect of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. He was the Archbishop who guided England through the early Reformation, and Henry VIII through the minefields of divorce. This is the first major biography for more than three decades, and the first for a century to exploit rich new manuscript sources in Britain and elsewhere. Diarmaid MacCulloch, one of the foremost scholars of the English Reformation, traces Cranmer from his east-midland roots to early Tudor Cambridge, into the household of the family of Anne Boleyn, and through the political labyrinth of the Henrician court. By then a major English statesman, living the life of a medieval prince-bishop, Cranmer navigated the church through the king's vacillations and finalized two successive English Prayer Books. MacCulloch skillfully reconstruction the crises which Cranmer negotiated, from his compromising association with three of Henry's divorces, the plot by religious conservatives to oust him, his role in the attempt to establish Lady Jane Grey as Queen, to the vengeance of the Catholic Mary Tudor. In gaol after Mary's accession, Cranmer nearly succumbed to recant his life's achievements, but was able to turn the very day of his death at the stake into a dramatic demonstration of his Protestant faith. From this vivid and fascinating account Cranmer emerges a more sharply-focused figure than before, more conservative early in his career than admirers have allowed, more evangelical than Anglicanism would later find comfortable."
"Secret City: The Hidden Jews Of Warsaw, 1940-1945",['Gunnar S. Paulsson'],"Though the Nazis forced most of Warsaw's Jews into the city's infamous ghetto during World War II, some 28,000 Jews either hid and never entered the Warsaw Ghetto or escaped from it. This book-the first detailed treatment of Jewish escape and hiding during the Holocaust-tells the dramatic story of the hidden Jews of Warsaw.
<p>Gunnar S. Paulsson shows that after the 1942 deportations nearly a quarter of the ghetto's remaining Jews managed to escape. Once in hiding, connected by elaborate networks of which Poles, Germans, and the Jews themselves were largely unaware, they formed what can aptly be called a secret city. Paulsson challenges many established assumptions. He shows that despite appalling difficulties and dangers, many of these Jews survived; that the much-reviled German, Polish, and Jewish policemen, as well as Jewish converts and their families, were key in helping Jews escape; that though many more Poles helped than harmed the Jews, most stayed neutral; and that escape and hiding happened spontaneously, without much help from either the Polish or the Jewish underground. He suggests that the Jewish leadership was wrong to dismiss the possibility of escape, staking everything on a hopeless uprising. Paulsson's engrossing book offers a new perspective on Jewish honor and Holocaust history.</p>
<p>Author Biography: Gunnar S. Paulsson is the Pearl Resnick Fellow at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, has taught at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and was Senior Historian of the Holocaust project at the Imperial War Museum, London.</p>"
Iran After Khomeini (washington Papers),['Shireen T. Hunter'],"Three years after the departure of the Ayatollah Rouhallah Khomeini, Iran's political future remains uncertain. This volume explores the directions the Islamic regime and, more importantly, the Iranian society and nation are likely to take in the 1990s. The study begins with a brief historical survey of Iran's political institutions, its sociocultural traits, and its economic and military conditions, as well as its foreign policy orientation at the time of the revolution. It follows with a summary of the political, social, and economic changes the Islamic revolution introduced. These serve as benchmarks against which to measure the changes and reforms of the last three years and provide a basis for sketching the potential future directions of Iran's domestic evolution and foreign relations."

"Taxing Ourselves, 4th Edition: A Citizen's Guide To The Debate Over Taxes","['Joel Slemrod', 'Jon Bakija']","To follow the debate over tax reform, the interested citizen is forced to choose between misleading sound bites and academic treatises. <i>Taxing Ourselves</i> bridges the gap between the two by presenting in clear nontechnical language the key issues in tax reform: who should pay taxes, how taxes affect the economy, and whether to reform or replace the current tax system. The authors discuss various alternative proposals in detail, including the flat tax and the sales tax, but they are not advocates for any of them; instead, they provide readers with the knowledge and the tools--including an informative overview of the U.S. tax system and an invaluable voter's guide to the tax policy debate--to make their own informed choices about how we should tax ourselves.<br>
<br>
The third edition of this popular guide has been extensively revised and updated to cover all changes in tax laws through May 2003 and to reflect the most recent research and relevant data. It also provides new or expanded treatment of issues in the current debate, including tax cuts and whether they stimulate the economy, savings incentives, double taxation of corporate income, the estate tax, corporate tax shelters, and the economic and political effects of budget deficits."
The Great Experiment: George Washington And The American Republic (yale Historical Publications),['John Rhodehamel'],"To most Americans, George Washington is a remote figure encased in myth, more a monument than a man. This new books brings him vividly to life once again - a man who was born a loyal subject of the British crown and became the leader of a radical revolution, a victorious military leader who relinquished the trappings of power to return to farming, a reluctant statesman who forged the institutions of a popular government that have endured for two centuries. The text is enhanced by numerous illustrations that reproduce an array of original documents, contemporary portraits, artifacts, and personal memorabilia of Washington and his family. This book is the catalogue for an exhibition that opens at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles in October 1998 and moves on to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City in September 1999."

U.s. Armed Forces Arsenal: A Guide To Modern Combat Hardware,['Samuel A. Southworth'],"Today's arsenal of war contains some of the most sophisticated weapons ever seen on the battlefield. The technological revolution has drastically altered how war is fought and brought about the invention of some highly unusual (and effective) weapons. In the recent war with Iraq, we caught a glimpse of the new high-tech weapons in America's arsenal and the wide-ranging array of modern equipment and transportation used by our armed forces. America's modern military hardware is the envy -and fear-of the world.In U.S. Armed Forces Arsenal, noted military historian Samuel A. Southworth takes the reader on an informal and informative guided tour of this new arsenal of weaponry. He explains in clear and concise prose the new generation of military hardware, from rifles to mortars, jeeps to tanks, robotic drones to night vision sensors, and all manner of bombs, missiles and rockets-the arms and armaments that have reshaped the way the U.S. goes to war, on land and sea and in the air."
Tonight At Noon: A Love Story,['Sue Graham Mingus'],"Tonight at Noon is a story of love between American opposites: she, a product of privilege, a Smith College graduate who worked as a journalist in Europe and in New York; he, an authentic jazz master, a brilliant, eccentric, difficult artist, a scion of Watts, Los Angeles, who would become one of America's foremost composers. Charles Mingus's improbable love for Sue Graham, his unpredictable confrontations, excesses, and exaggerations, drew her into a bewildering world, one where jazz and art were magnificent obsessions -obsessions refracted through Mingus's individualistic interpretation of life itself. It was a world that was as hostile, enlightening, and baffling as any far-off country. In Tonight at Noon, Sue Graham tells the story of that world, of her tumultuous, passionate marriage, and of her personal odyssey inside and outside its confines. Here is a love story that is also an important chapter in jazz history, a portrait of a marriage that also sheds light on the inner workings of a rare and complex artist whose music still plays to packed concert halls almost twenty-five years after his death."
Oscar Wilde's America: Counterculture In The Gilded Age,['Mary Warner Blanchard'],"Touring America as the ""Apostle of Aestheticism"" in 1882, Oscar Wilde brought a witty and controversial message of regeneration through art and beauty to a nation still shaken by the trauma of the Civil War.

Ordinary Heroes And American Democracy,['Gerald M. Pomper'],"True American heroes need not have superhuman abilities nor do they need to act alone. Heroism in a democracy is different from the heroism of myths and legends, says Gerald M. Pomper in this original and thoughtful book. Through the remarkable stories of eight diverse Americans who acted as heroes during national crises, he offers a new definition of heroism and new reasons to respect American institutions and the people who work within them. Pomper describes how responsible, good individuals can emerge as heroes from such core democratic institutions as the House of Representatives, the Senate, the courts, the presidency, and the press. From the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy to the prohibition of the dangerous drug thalidomide in the United States, American heroes ""just doing their jobs"" have played crucial roles in resolving national problems. Pomper considers why democratic heroism is unique and explores the special bond between America's political institutions and the heroes they empower."

"Round Up The Usual Suspects: Criminal Investigation In Law And Order, Cold Case, And Csi",['Raymond Ruble'],"TV shows that retain their popularity over the years do so for obvious reasons: good production values, good acting, and compelling storylines. But detective stories in particular also endure because they appeal to the gumshoe in all of us. America is obsessed with crime solving. Nancy Grace on <i>CNN Headline News</i>, Greta Van Susteren on Fox, and the seemingly annual recurrence of the courtroom sensation all testify to this fact. And these people and cases are able to reach their phenomenal status not simply because of the media-the media only demonstrates the enormous national appetite for this material. Rather, <i>Cold Case, CSI</i>, and <i>Law &amp; Order</i> have achieved their current popularity because they all respond to the same national craving for crime, and do so with great skill and creativity. <i>Round Up the Usual Suspects</i> provides a comparison of the crime fighting models and justice proceedings of each of these TV series.<br>
<br>
Each series has its own special crime-fighting niche, and each approaches its job with a different set of values and different paradigms of discovery and proof. Their separate approaches are each firmly grounded in different components of human nature - analytical reasoning, for instance, in <i>CSI</i>, memory in <i>Cold Case</i>, and teamwork in <i>Law &amp; Order</i>. After examining each of the individual series in depth, Ruble goes on to investigate some of the historical antecedents in classical TV detective series such as <i>The FBI</i> and <i>Dragnet</i>. It is interesting to note that these crime fighting methodologies are extensions of the way we all process information about the world. Ray Ruble here aims to increase our appreciation for the ingenious manner in which fictional cases are broken and convictions convincingly secured, and also illuminates the deeper human elements that lie under a more implicit spotlight in these runaway hits."

The Rascal King: The Life And Times Of James Michael Curley (1874-1958),['Jack Beatty'],"Twice-jailed scoundrel and the people's champion, builder of hospitals and schools and shameless grafter, compelling orator and master of political farce, James Michael Curley was the stuff of legend long before his life became fiction in Edwin O'Connor's classic novel <i>The Last Hurrah</i>. As mayor of Boston, as congressman, as governor of Massachusetts, Curley rose from the Irish slums in a career extending from the Progressive Era of Teddy Roosevelt to the ascendancy of JFK. Beatty's spellbinding story of this remarkable man—and of his city, his people, and his times—is biography at its best."
Sports And Games Of Ancient Egypt,['Wolfgang Decker'],"Two thousand years before the first Olympic games were held in ancient Greece, sports played a significant cultural and social role in ancient Egypt. This book, written by one of the world's leading authorities on Egyptian sport, is the most thorough treatment of the athletic and recreational activities of the people of ancient Egypt. Drawing on recent evidence from the fields of Egyptology and sport history, Wolfgang Decker describes how both kings and commoners enjoyed athletic activities. Some of the best-known pharaohs performed athletic feats to demonstrate their superiority, says Decker. He discusses the primary sport of the kings--archery--as well as other royal athletic enthusiasms like track and chariot racing. He then provides rich detail on the sports of commoners: racing, jumping, aquatic sports, wrestling, stick fighting, and boxing. Decker also explores the evidence for such recreational activities as ball games, children's games, board games, and acrobatic dances. In a concluding section on hunting, he notes that certain animals were reserved largely for the pharaoh and others for the nobles. Throughout the book, Decker is sensitive to the sociological and political issues that surround sporting activity. Beautifully illustrated and fascinating to read, this book was highly praised when it was published in Germany in 1987. It is now available for the first time to English-speaking readers."
Journalism And New Media,['John V. Pavlik'],"Ubiquitous news, global information access, instantaneous reporting, interactivity, multimedia content, extreme customization: Journalism is undergoing the most fundamental transformation since the rise of the penny press in the nineteenth century. Here is a report from the front lines on the impact and implications for journalists and the public alike.<br>
<br>
John Pavlik, executive director of the Center for New Media at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, argues that the new media can revitalize news gathering and reengage an increasingly distrustful and alienated citizenry. The book is a valuable reference on everything from organizing a new age newsroom to job hunting in the new media."
Nations Without Nationalism,['Julia Kristeva'],"Underlying Julia Kristeva's latest work is the idea that otherness - whether it be ethnic, religious, social, or political - needs to be understood and accepted in order to guarantee social harmony. Nations Without Nationalism is an impassioned plea for tolerance and for commonality, aimed at a world brimming over with racism and xenophobia. Responding to the rise of neo-Nazi groups in Germany and Eastern Europe and the continued popularity of the National Front in France, Kristeva turns to the origins of the nation-state to illustrate the problematic nature of nationalism and its complex configurations in subsequent centuries. For Kristeva, the key to commonality can be found in Montesquieu's esprit general - his notion of the social body as a guaranteed hierarchy of private rights. Nations Without Nationalism also contains Kristeva's thoughts on Harlem Desir, the founder of the antiracist organization SOS Racisme; the links between psychoanalysis and nationalism; the historical nature of French national identity; the relationship between esprit general and Volksgeist; Charles de Gaulle's complex ideas involving the ""nation"" and his dream of a unified Europe. In the tradition of Strangers to Ourselves, her most recent nonfiction work, Nations Without Nationalism reflects a passionate commitment to enlightenment and social justice. As ethnic strife persists in Europe and the United States, Kristeva's humanistic message carries with it a special resonance and urgency."

Edible Wild Mushrooms Of North America: A Field-to-kitchen Guide,"['David W. Fischer', 'Alan E. Bessette']","Unusual shapes and colors make many mushrooms alluring to the eye, while the exotic flavors and textures of edible mushrooms are a gourmet delicacy for the palate. Yet many people never venture beyond the supermarket offerings, fearing that all other mushrooms are poisonous. 
<p>With amateur mushroom hunters especially in mind, David Fischer and Alan Bessette have prepared Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. This field guide presents more than 100 species of the most delicious mushrooms, along with detailed information on how to find, gather, store, and prepare them for the table. More than 70 savory recipes, ranging from soups and salads to casseroles, canapes, quiches, and even a dessert, are included.</p>
<p>Throughout, the authors constantly emphasize the need for correct identification of species for safe eating. Each species is described in detailed, nontechnical language, accompanied by a list of key identifying characteristics that reliably rule out all but the target species. Superb color photographs also aid in identification. Poisonous ""lookalikes"" are described and illustrated, and the authors also assess the risks of allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to edible species and the possibilities of chemical or bacterial contamination.<br>

Efficiency In U.s. Manufacturing Industries,"['Caves, Richard E.']","Using the recently developed stochastic frontier production function, Richard Caves and David Barton estimate the degree of technical efficiency in nearly 350 U.S. manufacturing industries and explain the variation in efficiency among industries. They reach a number of strong conclusions, including the observation that import competition and flexible employment arrangements are beneficial whereas corporate diversification hurts efficiency.
<p>Caves and Barton describe and evaluate the stochastic frontier production function, which allows them to credibly estimate technical inefficiency. Using U.S. Census data on individual manufacturing establishments, they obtain the frontier production functions for over 300 industries. They then propose hypotheses derived from modern developments in economic analysis and theory which explain differences in efficiency. The hypotheses embrace many dimensions of competition and economic organization (both enterprise and labor), as well as sources of heterogeneous productivity levels such as capital-vintage differences, product differentiation, and differential rents to innovation</p>
<p>Among studies of efficiency that have been conducted over the past three decades, <i>Efficiency in U.S. Manufacturing Industries</i> is unmatched in the breadth and depth of its coverage. The hypotheses tested range more widely, and the analysis is extended to cover differences in efficiency among small and large firms and in the dynamic effects of efficiency differences on industries' rates of productivity growth. The review of the existing literature is unusually complete.</p>

Queer Issues In Contemporary Latin American Cinema,['David William Foster'],"Viewing contemporary Latin American films through the lens of queer studies reveals that many filmmakers are exploring issues of gender identity and sexual difference, as well as the homophobia that attempts to defeat any challenge to the heterosexual norms of patriarchal culture. In this study of queer issues in Latin American cinema, David William Foster offers highly perceptive queer readings of fourteen key films to demonstrate how these cultural products promote the principles of an antiheterosexist stance while they simultaneously disclose how homophobia enforces the norms of heterosexuality.<br> Foster examines each film in terms of the ideology of its narrative discourse, whether homoerotic desire or a critique of patriarchal heterosexism and its implications for Latin American social life and human rights. His analyses underscore the difficulties involved in constructing a coherent and convincing treatment of the complex issues involved in critiquing the patriarchy from perspectives associated with queer studies.

Vivaldi's Venice,['Patrick Barbier'],"Vivaldi, born in 1678, was one of the most influential composers and violinists of his age. This book evokes the Venice of Vivaldi's time, an essentially musical city that lived for hedonism. In Venice all the social classes mingled in their love of music-artistocrats, gondoliers, and workers would meet at all sorts of musical and theatrical entertainments and the city's carnivals went on for months at a time. Erudite and entertaining, Vivaldi's Venice is a biography of the city that was the muse of the mysterious young composer.

"Brain Processes, Theories, And Models: An International Conference In Honor Of W.s. Mcculloch 25 Years After His Death (the Mit Press)",['Jose Mira-mira'],"W. S. McCulloch, a professor of psychiatry at Illinois, later a scientist at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT and author of the groundbreaking book, <i>Embodiments of Mind</i> (reissued in paperback in 1988), was one of the founding fathers of ""Cybernetics."" Along with Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann, and H. von Foerster, he sought to integrate the disciplines of neurophysiology, mathematics, and engineering in a rigorous investigation into what brains do and how they do it. A magnetic personality, McCulloch set thoughts into motion (for instance neural nets as parallel computers) that have sparked research and controversy for decades.
<p>These 55 contributions celebrate the lasting impact that McCulloch had on the study of the brain and the formal modeling of human intelligence. They cover a number of varied topics in the general area of neural modeling and are divided into five sections: Essays and General Brain Theory, Mathematical Tools and Global Models, Neurons and Neural Nets, Vision, and AI and Engineering related topics.</p>

Women in Science,['Ogilvie'],"Was Marie Curie the only woman in science? This question, asked by a college student trying to write an essay on women in science, planted a seed that grew over a decade of research into this informative and accessible biographical dictionary and bibliography.<p>At the heart of this biographical dictionary are profiles of 186 women whose work is representative of the participation of women in the science of their time and culture. Despite the increasing attention devoted to women's history in recent years, our knowledge of many of these women is still meager, and the book will serve as much as a guide to future research as a resource for historians, librarians, students, and the general public.</p><p>The book opens with a substantial essay relating the general state of science and philosophical ideas about the role of women in society to the actual participation of women in science over the past two and a half millennia. The classified, annotated bibliography that completes the book can be used as a general research tool as well as a source of information about the particular women whose lives are sketched in this work.</p><p>The entries provide basic information on their subjects, are referenced to primary sources and other materials in the bibliography, and share an easily flowing narrative style.

Psychologists In Word And Image,"['Wade, Nicholas.']","We are all fascinated by physiognomy, intrigued by the appearance of the people we admire. These perceptual portraits of more than 100 thinkers who have fashioned our understanding of mind and behavior provide an alternative view of the history of psychology that is both pleasing and puzzling.
<p>Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Pierre Broca, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Ruth Benedict, Allen Newell, David Marr and scores of others whose ideas have made psychology an empirical discipline emerge from motifs specifically drawn by the author or derived from a figure or text in one of the portrayed person's books, or an apparatus he or she invented. The ingenious treatment of portrait/motifs often challenges the viewer to discern the faces embedded in them and always tells us more than how these students of mind looked: these portraits reflect their thoughts and lead us to forage further into their lives and legacies.</p>
<p>The portraits and motifs have been manipulated in a variety of ways, using graphic and photographic procedures. They are arranged in order of birth date in a format of one page of descriptive text facing a full-page perceptual portrait. The text presents a brief synopsis of the person portrayed, that person's ideas, and the source of both the portrait and the motif. Interrelations between people are stressed, bringing to light common threads that run through the work of particular groups and adding yet another level to this unique gallery of psychology's pioneers.</p>"

Agitations: essays on life and literature,"['Krystal, Arthur.']","We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis. Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?"
Simple Things Won't Save The Earth: By J. Robert Hunter,"['Hunter, J.

All of these ""earth friendly"" choices and products convince us that we are ""thinking globally, acting locally"" and saving the planet. But are we really?<br>
 In this provocative book, J. Robert Hunter asserts that using catchy slogans and symbols to sell the public on environmental conservation is ineffective, misleading, and even dangerous. Debunking the Fifty Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth approach, Hunter shows that there are no simple solutions to major environmental problems such as species extinction, ozone depletion, global warming, pollution, and non-renewable resource consumption.<br>
 The use of slogans and symbols, Hunter argues, simply gives the public a false sense that ""someone"" is solving the environmental crisis--while it remains as serious now as when the environmental movement began. Writing in plain yet passionate prose for general readers, he here opens a national debate on what is really required to preserve the earth as a habitat for the human species.<br>"

Innovation in key areas such as building a skills portfolio in the firm; shaping the product and service mix; designing processes which achieve a true symbiosis between the firm and its environment; directing resources in a way which reflect needs, not structures; sustaining the energy level of the enterprise and its members; and learning to manage talent."
The Elements Of Teaching,"['James M. Banner Jr.', 'Harold C. Cannon']","What are the characteristics of a great teacher? What qualities of mind and spirit are necessary to help others acquire the knowledge through which they can understand and live a good life? In this book, James Banner and Harold Cannon draw on many years of experience to set forth the intellectual, moral, and emotional capacities that they believe the best teachers must possess. Their book is an inspiring guide to current and future schoolteachers and to college and university professors - indeed to everyone who teaches anything to anyone else. Arguing that teaching is an art, Banner and Cannon help teachers understand its components. They analyze the specific qualities of successful teachers and the ways in which these qualities promote learning and understanding. Throughout, they illustrate their discussion with sharply etched portraits of fictional teachers who exemplify - or fail to exemplify - a particular quality. Neither a how-to book nor a consideration of the philosophy, methods, or activities of teaching, this book, more precisely, assesses what it takes to teach. It encourages teachers to consider how they might strengthen their own level of professional performance."

"Race, poverty, and domestic policy",['C. Michael Henry: Editor'],"What explains the continuing hardship of so many black Americans? A distinguished group of scholars analyzes the long, complex structural and environmental causes of discrimination and their effects on African-Americans. The authors examine the impact of poverty, poor health, poor schools, poor housing, poor neighborhoods, and few job opportunities—and demonstrate how multiple causes reinforce each other and condemn African-Americans to positions of inferiority and poverty. Some of the contributors examine policies designed to correct problems, while others look at the changing racial and ethnic composition in America and its implications for African-Americans, as other minorities surpass them in numbers and claim political, economic, and social attention.

The Feminization Of Quest-romance: Radical Departures,['Dana A. Heller'],"What happens when a woman dares to imagine herself a hero? Questing, she sets out for unknown regions. Lighting a torch, she elicits from the darkness stories never told or heard before. The woman hero sails against the tides of great legends that recount the adventures of heroic men, legends deemed universal, timeless, and essential to our understanding of the natural order that holds us and completes us in its spiral. Yet these myths and rituals do not fulfill her need for an empowering self-image nor do they grant her the mobility she requires to imagine, enact, and represent her quest for authentic self-knowledge.<br>
 The Feminization of Quest-Romance proposes that a female quest is a revolutionary step in both literary and cultural terms. Indeed, despite the difficulty that women writers face in challenging myths, rituals, psychological theories, and literary conventions deemed universal by a culture that exalts masculine ideals and universalizes male experience, a number of revolutionary texts have come into existence in the second half of the twentieth century by such American women writers as Jean Stafford, Mary McCarthy, Anne Moody, Marilynne Robinson, and Mona Simpson, all of them working to redefine the literary portrayal of American women's quests. They work, in part, by presenting questing female characters who refuse to accept the roles accorded them by restrictive social norms, even if it means sacrificing themselves in the name of rebellion. In later texts, female heroes survive their ""lighting out"" experiences to explore diverse alternatives to the limiting roles that have circumscribed female development.<br>
 This study of The Mountain Lion, Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, Coming of Age in Mississippi, Housekeeping, and Anywhere but Here identifies transformations of the quest-romance that support a viable theory of female development and offer literary patterns that challenge the male monopoly on transformative knowledge and heroic action."

Zapotec Women (texas Press Sourcebooks In Anthropology),['Lynn Stephen'],"What happens when indigenous culture is packaged for sale in the United States? How does capital accumulation affect relations between men and women, local politics, kinship, and reciprocal exchanges of goods and labor? In this innovative study of several Zapotec communities in and around Oaxaca, Mexico, Lynn Stephen explores these questions, looking at how commercial weaving for export has altered the lives of women since the Mexican Revolution. Drawing on firsthand insights gleaned during two and a half years of fieldwork, Stephen shows that the expansion of capitalism has affected Zapotec women in different ways. She demonstrates how class and ethnicity as well as gender determine women's roles and standing in the community. Individual life histories complement her data, showing how women may hold a position of importance in one area (ritual life, weaving production, or local politics), while occupying a subservient position in another. She also compares Zapotec women's participation in local politics with that of other peasant women in Mexico. Stephen concludes that while the commercialization of Zapotec weaving has produced class differentiation - as classic economic theories predict - it has also reinforced kin-based institutions that support a strong sense of local ethnic identity. These findings offer important new insights for the fields of economic and political anthropology, Latin American and Third World studies, and women's studies."

This unique book provides English-speaking readers with the responses of those who experienced firsthand the events of the middle-Stalinist period. The book contains 157 documents—mostly letters to authorities from Soviet citizens, but also reports compiled by the secret police and Communist Party functionaries, internal government and party memoranda, and correspondence among party officials.

The Paris Diary & The New York Diary 1951-1961,['Ned Rorem'],"When <i>The Paris Diary</i> exploded on the scene in 1966 there had never been a book in English quite like it: Its intimate combination of personal, literary, and social insights was unprecedented. Rorem's self-portrait of the artist as a young man, written between 1951 and 1955, was also a mirror of the times, depicting the now vanished milieu of Cocteau, Eluard, Gide, Landowska, Boulez, the Vicomtesse de Noailles, and others whose paths crossed with Rorem's in such settings as Paris, Morocco, and Italy. <i>The New York Diary</i>, published the following year, pictured the period between 1956 and 1960, when Rorem had returned to America. The diaries marked the beginnings of Gay Liberation, not because Rorem made a special issue of his sexuality, but because he did not; rather, he wrote of his affairs frankly and unashamedly. A casualness informs each sensual entry, and the overall tone is at once bratty and brilliant, insecure and vain, loving and cultured, but, above all, honest and entertaining.

Just As We Were: A Narrow Slice Of Texas Womanhood,"['Mackintosh, Prudence.']","When a Texas debutante bows her forehead to the floor in the famous ""Texas dip,"" society columnists all across the country speculate interminably over what it is that sets Texas women apart. But really, how could they know? Even women born and bred in Texas - the daughters of generations of Texans - can't always answer that question. Prudence Mackintosh comes very close to an answer, though, in this endlessly entertaining book. Writing with both a wry sense of humor and an insider's compassion, she offers us a fascinating, nose-against-the-glass look into the world of privileged, educated, well-married, well-connected, and mostly wealthy white Texas women. What really sets these women apart, Ms. Mackintosh tells us, is the comfortable yet demanding path they follow from their idyllic girlhoods to positions of prominence - either in their own right or as the wives, mothers, and daughters of prominent men. In eleven essays, some of which originally appeared in Texas Monthly magazine, she charts the way stations that mark this path: summer camps in the Texas Hill Country, exclusive private schools like Dallas' Hockaday, sorority membership, and acceptance into the Junior League. Prudence Mackintosh has been both an outsider and an insider in this privileged world, and she knows its ways. Whether she's writing about the elaborate rituals of pledge week in the 1960s, or the ambivalent ties that bind white women and the women of color who work in their homes, or the achievements of such prominent figures as Barbara Jordan, Ann Richards, and Liz Carpenter, her observations are shot through with wit and real insight. Just As We Were may not be the final word on elite Texas women, but no one else has described their world with more irony and accuracy than Prudence Mackintosh."
Walt Disney's Alice In Wonderland,['Franc Mateu'],"When Alice tumbles down, down, down a rabbit-hole one hot summer's afternoon in pursuit of a White Rabbit she finds herself in Wonderland. And there begin the fantastical adventures that will see her experiencing extraordinary changes in size, swimming in a pool of her own tears and attending the very maddest of tea parties. For Wonderland is no ordinary place and the characters that populate it are quite unlike anybody young Alice has ever met before. In this imaginary land she encounters the savagely violent Queen, the Lachrymose Mock Turtle, the laconic Cheshire Cat and the hookah-smoking Caterpillar, each as surprising and outlandish as the next. Alice's adventures have made her the stuff of legend, the child heroine <i>par excellence</i>, and ensured that Carroll's book is the best loved and most widely read in children's literature.<br>

Let The People In: The Life And Times Of Ann Richards,['Jan Reid'],"When Ann Richards delivered the keynote of the 1988 Democratic National Convention and mocked President George H. W. Bush--""Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth""--she instantly became a media celebrity and triggered a rivalry that would alter the course of American history. In 1990, Richards won the governorship of Texas, upsetting the GOP's colorful rancher and oilman Clayton Williams. The first ardent feminist elected to high office in America, she opened up public service to women, blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans, gays, and the disabled. Her progressive achievements and the force of her personality created a lasting legacy that far transcends her rise and fall as governor of Texas.<br>
 In Let the People In, Jan Reid draws on his long friendship with Richards, interviews with her family and many of her closest associates, her unpublished correspondence with longtime companion Bud Shrake, and extensive research to tell a very personal, human story of Ann Richards's remarkable rise to power as a liberal Democrat in a conservative Republican state. Reid traces the whole arc of Richards's life, beginning with her youth in Waco, her marriage to attorney David Richards, her frustration and boredom with being a young housewife and mother in Dallas, and her shocking encounters with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter. He follows Richards to Austin and the wild 1970s scene and describes her painful but successful struggle against alcoholism. He tells the full, inside story of Richards's rise from county office and the state treasurer's office to the governorship, where she championed gun control, prison reform, environmental protection, and school finance reform, and he explains why she lost her reelection bid to George W. Bush, which evened his family's score and launched him toward the presidency. Reid describes Richards's final years as a world traveler, lobbyist, public speaker, and mentor and inspiration to office holders, including Hillary Clinton. His nuanced portrait reveals a complex woman who battled her own frailties and a good-old-boy establishment to claim a place on the national political stage and prove ""what can happen in government if we simply open the doors and let the people in.""<br>"
Men to Boys: The Making of Modern Immaturity,['Gary Cross'],"When did maturity become the ultimate taboo? Men have gone from idolizing Cary Grant to aping Hugh Grant, shunning marriage and responsibility well into their twenties and thirties. Gary Cross, renowned cultural historian, identifies the boy-man and his habits, examining the attitudes and practices of three generations to make sense of this gradual but profound shift in American masculinity. Cross matches the rise of the American boy-man to trends in twentieth-century advertising, popular culture, and consumerism, and he locates the roots of our present crisis in the vague call for a new model of leadership that, ultimately, failed to offer a better concept of maturity. Cross does not blame the young or glorify the past. He finds that men of the Greatest Generation might have embraced their role as providers but were confused by the contradictions and expectations of modern fatherhood. Their uncertainty gave birth to the Beats and men who indulged in childhood hobbies and boyish sports. Rather than fashion a new manhood, baby-boomers held onto their youth and, when that was gone, embraced Viagra. Without mature role models to emulate or rebel against, Generation X turned to cynicism and sensual intensity, and the media fed on this longing, transforming a life stage into a highly desirable lifestyle. Arguing that contemporary American culture undermines both conservative ideals of male maturity and the liberal values of community and responsibility, Cross concludes with a proposal for a modern marriage of personal desire and ethical adulthood."
Edith Wharton's Inner Circle (literary Modernism),['Susan Goodman'],"When Edith Wharton became friends with Henry James, she joined a group of men who became her ""inner circle"" or, sometimes, ""the happy few."" This group included both well-known figures, such as James, Percy Lubbock, and Bernard Berenson, and several now forgotten, including John Hugh Smith, Walter Berry, Gaillard Lapsley, Robert Norton, and Howard Sturgis. Drawing on unpublished archival material by and about members of the circle, Susan Goodman here presents an intimate view of this American expatriate community, as well as the larger transatlantic culture it mirrored. She explores how the group, which began forming around 1904 and lasted until Wharton's death in 1937, defined itself against the society its founders had left in the United States, while simultaneously criticizing and accommodating the one it found in Europe. Tracing Wharton's individual relationships with these men and their relationships with one another, she examines literary kinships and movements in the biographical and feminist context of gender, exile, and aesthetics. Individual chapters focus on the history of the circle, its connections to and competition with the Bloomsbury Group, the central friendship of Wharton and James, the dynamics of influence within the circle, and the effect of Wharton's vision of the inner circle on her fiction. A concluding chapter examines the phenomenon of literary exile and investigates how other writers - Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald, among them - positioned themselves in their inherited or chosen places. Filled with new insights into Wharton's works and her relationships with a group of asexual or homoerotically oriented men, this study will be important reading for all readers of American literature, literary modernism, and gender studies."
Thoreau's Ecstatic Witness,['Alan D. Hodder'],"When Henry David Thoreau died in 1862, friends and admirers remembered him as an eccentric man whose outer life was continuously fed by deeper spiritual currents. But scholars have since focused almost exclusively on Thoreau's literary, political, and scientific contributions. This book offers the first in-depth study of Thoreau's religious thought and experience. In it Alan D. Hodder recovers the lost spiritual dimension of the writer's life, revealing a deeply religious man who, despite his rejection of organized religion, possessed a rich inner life, characterized by a sort of personal, experiential, nature-centered, and eclectic spirituality that finds wider expression in America today.
<p>At the heart of Thoreau's life were episodes of exhilaration in nature that he commonly referred to as his ecstasies. Hodder explores these representations of ecstasy throughout Thoreau's writings -- from the riverside reflections of his first book through</p>
<p> Walden and the later journals, when he conceived his journal writing as a spiritual discipline in itself and a kind of forum in which to cultivate experiences of contemplative non-attachment. In doing so, Hodder restores to our understanding the deeper spiritual dimension of Thoreau's life to which his writings everywhere bear witness.</p>"
Year Of The Dog: A Novel,"['Hearon, Shelby , 1931-']","When her husband dumps her for an old girlfriend and sets all of Peachland, South Carolina, gossiping, Janey Daniels has to get away-far away-for a ""sabbatical"" year. She flees to Burlington, Vermont, home of her Great Aunt May, her mother's only living relative. There she adopts Beulah, a Labrador puppy in training to become a Companion Dog for the Blind. Not for a moment does Janey suspect that this ""year of the dog"" will change her life forever.<br>
 Shelby Hearon is an acknowledged master at illuminating the nuances of relationships. In Year of the Dog, she explores the surprising ways that the heart heals after a betrayal. While Janey is training Beulah, Beulah leads Janey to a new love, James Maarten, a smart, ""fidgety"" teacher they meet at the dog park. As Janey soon discovers, James has suffered a betrayal of his own that makes it hard for him to open up and trust her with even the smallest details of his past. While Janey tries to help James, she also reaches out to her enigmatic Aunt May, a retired librarian reputed to be the friend, perhaps even the lover, of popular mystery writer Bert Greenwood. When Janey attempts to solve the twin mysteries of why her great aunt has distanced herself from the family--and what her true relationship is with Bert Greenwood--Beulah provides the clues that lead Janey to uncover the secrets of her aunt's life. By the time Janey's year in Vermont comes to an end, the people whose lives Beulah has linked will discover that healing and reconciliation can come in the most unexpected ways.<br>"
Viewers Like You?,"['Laurie Oullette', 'Laurie Ouellette']","When most people think of public television they envision educational or cultural programs and slow-moving conversations between knowledgeable experts. We are told that we ought to watch these worthwhile alternatives to the time-wasting commercial amusements that populate primetime, and yet ratings show we rarely do. Despite the current of frustration about television that runs through American life, most Americans bypass the redemptive ""oasis of the wasteland"" for the sitcoms, serial dramas, soap operas, music videos, game shows, and popular news programs churned out by the culture industries. This book traces the history of public broadcasting, questions public television´s commonsense priorities, and argues that its tendency to reject popular culture has undermined its capacity to serve the people it claims to represent."
To The Bitter End,['Hans Gisevius'],"When on July 20, 1944, a bomb—boldly placed inside the Wolf's Lair (Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia) by the German Anti-Nazi Resistance—exploded without killing the Führer, the subsequent coup d'état against the Third Reich collapsed. Most of the conspirators were summarily shot or condemned in show trials and sadistically hanged. The conspiracy involved a wide circle of former politicians, diplomats, and government officials as well as senior military men. The Resistance had started as early as 1933 and involved several planned putsches and assassination attempts. Hans B. Gisevius knew or met the major figures—including Beck, Canaris, Oster, Goerdeler, and von Stauffenberg—and barely escaped after the coup's failure. One of the few survivors of the German Anti-Nazi Resistance, Gisevius traces its history, from the 1933 Reichstag fire to Germany's defeat in 1945, in a book as riveting as it is exceptional."

Siu explores this question by examining a rural community in Guangdong Province from the late nineteenth century to the present."
Breaking Away: Coleridge in Scotland,"['Carol Kyros Walker', 'Samuel Taylor Coleridge']","When Samuel Taylor Coleridge set out on a tour of Scotland with his friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth in the summer of 1803, his wits were as sharp as ever but his health, professional career, marriage, and friendship with William and his sister Dorothy were in a deteriorating state. On the fifteenth day of their travels, the Wordsworths and Coleridge parted ways, ostensibly so that Coleridge could return home. Instead he pursued his own Scottish tour, finding pleasure in his solitude, speed ('263 miles in eight days'), and endurance. This book draws on Coleridge's letters and notebooks to look at his travels with the Wordsworths from his own point of view and to record and photograph the journey he experienced after he parted from them. Carol Kyros Walker, editor of Dorothy Wordsworth's own Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, now retraces Coleridge's very different Scottish tour and recounts his adventures there. In a remarkable photographic and literary essay, she argues that Coleridge's speed, energy, reflections, notes, and letters all betray a man of great talent who was breaking away -- from the Wordsworths, from his wife, from his life in the Lake District, and from a dry phase of his writing career."
The Wavell&#39;s Command : The Definitive History Of The Desert War,['Barrie Pitt'],"When Sir Archibald Wavell assumed command of the British forces in North Africa, he had no choice but to keep Egypt from falling to the Axis. A defeat would give Hitler access to the Red Sea, and with it access to the oil-rich Persian Gulf and even to India. Because of Wavell's limited resources, he decided attack was the best form of defense. Wavell's brilliant campaign was carried out by his field commander, General Richard O'Connor, who routed Marshal Rodolfo Graziani's Italian forces, took thousands of prisoners, and pushed the Italians back hundreds of miles. The exhilarating and essential victory was short-lived, lasting only a few months until Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps entered the conflict in early 1941.<br>"

Pioneers Of The Hardwood: Indiana And The Birth Of Professional Basketball,['Todd Gould'],"While everyone knows about the growth of basketball in high schools and colleges, the story of Indiana's role in the development of professional basketball has not been told before. It is a lively story of raucous fans, local heroes, and men who loved the game and were willing to play for nickels. Gould covers the three Indianapolis teams - the Em-Rocs, the Kautskys, and the Olympians - and the Fort Wayne Pistons (later the Detroit Pistons), who dominated professional basketball for a number of years. Setting his story within the context of the times, he also discusses some of the teams that the local heroes competed against, including the famous New York Celtics (the original Celtics) and the gifted Harlem Rens (the first all-black professional team)."
The Literature Of British Domestic Architecture 1715-1842,['John Archer'],"While few historians would dispute the importance of the printed book in the development of domestic design in 18th- and 19th-century Britain, this is the first major study to trace the evolution of architectural ideas during the period by examining the literary output of architects. It is a work of extraordinary scholarship, based on an extensive search of dozens of major library collections, that will serve as a standard resource for researchers and librarians, book dealers and collectors.
<p>Most of the book is devoted to descriptions of hundreds of books and periodicals containing original designs for domestic structures. The earliest title described is Colen Campbell's <i>Vitruvius Britannicus</i> (1715), an important Palladian manifesto and the first book to illustrate a series of the author's own executed designs for dwellings, intended to redirect and reform British architectural taste, and the latest title is Supplement (1842) to John Claudius Loudon's <i>Encyclopedia.</i> Related materials on agriculture, landscape design, drawing, and perspective also are covered. Each entry includes a bibliographic description of all known editions and a commentary that describes and analyzes the text and plates, focusing in particular on the author's ideas and approaches to design issues.</p>
<p>Appendixes to the principal entries provide a checklist of additional handbooks and manuals by important authors such as Crunden, Halfpenny, Langley, Nicholson, Pain, Richardson, Salmon, and Swan, and books showing domestic interiors. There is also a valuable short-title chronological list, and a list of printers, publishers, and booksellers.</p>
<p>In a lengthy introductory essay, Archer discusses architecture and the book trade, the format and content of the books, and aspects of architectural theory and design-including ideas of ""character"" and ""retirement,"" dwelling types such as villas, cottages, and row houses, model housing for laborers, and town and village planning.</p>

Latino high school graduation: defying the odds,"['Romo, Harriett']","While high school drop-out rates have steadily declined among white and African American students over the last twenty years, a constant 35 percent of Latino students continue to quit school before graduation. In this pioneering work, Harriett Romo and Toni Falbo reveal how a group of at-risk Latino students defied the odds and earned a high school diploma.<br>
 Romo and Falbo tracked the progress of 100 students in Austin, Texas, from 1989 to 1993. Drawing on interviews with the students and their parents, school records, and fieldwork in the schools and communities, the authors identify both the obstacles that caused many students to drop out and the successful strategies that other students and their parents pursued to ensure high school graduation.<br>
 The authors conclude with seven far-reaching recommendations for changes in the public schools. Sure to provoke debate among all school constituencies, this book will be required reading for school administrators, teachers, parents, legislators, and community leaders.<br>"
White On Black: Images Of Africa And Blacks In Western Popular Culture,['Jan Nederveen Pieterse'],"White on Black is a compelling visual history of the development of European and American stereotypes of black people over the last two hundred years. Jan Nederveen Pieterse shows the pervasiveness of prejudice against blacks throughout the western world as expressed in stock-in-trade racist imagery and caricature. Reproducing a wide range of illustrations-from engravings and lithographs to advertisements, candy wrappings, biscuit tins, dolls, posters, and comic strips-the book raises troubling questions about caricature and parody as instruments of oppression.<br>"
The American Century: The Rise And Decline Of The United States As A World Power,['Professor Donald W. White'],"Why did the United States assume a preeminent world role after World War II, and why has that role declined since the Vietnam War? This book—the first intellectual and cultural history of America's evolving status as a world power in the twentieth century—addresses these questions by examining Americans' perceptions of themselves and of the world during this period. Drawing on the writings of leading intellectuals, speeches by politicians, popular periodicals, movies and television, opinion polls, and dozens of other sources, Donald W. White explores what Americans thought about power in the twentieth century, how they evaluated America's expanding world role and the confrontations of the Cold War, and how they perceived the erosion of this unprecedented accumulation of power in the years after the Vietnam War."
Fighting back,['Harold Werner; edited by Mark Werner; with a foreword by Martin Gilbert'],"Why didn't the Jews resist being rounded up and sent to concentration camps? Why did they go like lambs to the slaughter? were the questions Harold Werner's sons asked about the Holocaust while they were growing up. Written to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity, Fighting Back is more than the tale of survival: it is the extraordinary memoir of a survivor who outlasted Hitler's Holocaust, not in a concentration camp but in the woods of eastern Poland as a fighter in a successful Jewish resistance group during the Second World War. In this book Harold Werner recounts his experiences as a member of a large Jewish partisan unit that aggressively conducted military missions against the German army in occupied Poland. The unit of young Jews--both men and women--received air drops from the Russians, wiped out local German garrisons, blew up German trains, and even shot down German planes. In addition to engaging in military sabotage, these partisans rescued Jews from ghetto imprisonment and slave labor detail, and provided a safe haven in the Parczew Forest for other Jews who escaped the Nazi extermination camps. By the time the Russians liberated eastern Poland, the unit consisted of about four hundred fighters and four hundred noncombatant Jews under their protection. Few accounts of Jewish survival during the Holocaust describe such a rare combination of victorious military activities and humanitarian efforts in successful large-scale Jewish resistance against the Nazis. Not only is Fighting Back a way of understanding Jewish struggles against terrifying odds, it provides rare vignettes of life in Jewish shtetls, or small towns, before the Holocaust wiped them out. In describing his childhood years, Werner provides a flavor of that extinct society--as rich in tradition, religion, and learning as it was poor in material possessions. Harold Werner's compelling work is a moving portrayal of the difficulties faced by Eastern European Jews trying to fight the Nazi ca"
Why So Slow?: The Advancement Of Women,['Virginia Valian'],"Why do so few women occupy positions of power and prestige? Virginia Valian uses concepts and data from psychology, sociology, economics, and biology to explain the disparity in the professional advancement of men and women. According to Valian, men and women alike have implicit hypotheses about gender differences - gender schemas - that create small sex differences in characteristics, behaviors, perceptions, and evaluations of men and women. Those small imbalances accumulate to advantage men and disadvantage women."
Seven Dirty Words And Six Other Stories: Controlling The Content Of Print And Broadcast,"['Spitzer, Matthew L. (matthew Laurence) , 1952-']","Why does the United States control the content of broadcast more strictly than it controls the content of print? In this provocative book, Matthew L. Spitzer explores the various rationales that support such different treatment and concludes that broadcast media should not be as strictly regulated as it is. <br>
Spitzer attacks the three most prevalent arguments in favor of broadcast control, utilizing insights from economics and social psychology and relating them to basic questions of First Amendment law and regulation of broadcasting. First, he shows that arguments centered on economic efficiency-such as those based on the supposed scarcity of the airwaves-can be applied equally to the print media. Next, responding to arguments that exposure to sexually explicit material encourages socially harmful conduct, he demonstrates that sexually explicit printed matter is at least as pernicious as broadcast erotica and that printed violence seems to have the same effects as broadcast violence. The third series of arguments-that broadcasting is more readily available to young children than is print-does have some validity, says Spitzer. However, we can shield children from exposure to broadcast material that may harm them by several methods: ""zoning"" broadcast violence and sexy by confining such matter to ""adult"" channels that can be received only by special receivers; allowing sex and violence to be broadcast only during the late night hours; and requiring television locks so that parents can monitor children's access to programming.<br>
According to Spitzer, there is not justification for censorship of indecent programming or for such regulations as the fairness doctrine or equal time for political candidates. His timely and spirited book makes a powerful case for changing national policy in this significant area."
The Spanish American Roots Of William Carlos Williams,['Julio Marzán'],"William Carlos Williams wrote from an all-encompassing American vision that recalls the spirit of Walt Whitman. Paradoxically, though, this most-American poet sprang from foreign roots--a Puerto Rican mother and a father who was an English-born Caribbean islander.
<p>In this poetically evocative work, Julio Marzán explores the Latin American roots of Williams' poetry. In particular, he focuses on the dualities and contradictions between Williams' public, North American persona, ""Bill,"" and his private, poetically encrypted Latin persona, ""Carlos."" He shows how Williams' poetry draws on Latin American and Spanish sources, particularly the poetry of Spaniard Luis de Góngora, to encode a Latin subtext in poems that ostensibly present a mainstream, Anglo vision.</p>
<p>These explorations uncover a wealth of complexity in Williams and his poetry. Reflecting the experience of many immigrants, his life and work embody the unreconcilable desires to assimilate and win acceptance in a new land while remaining separate and immersed in the beloved culture of one's birth.</p>"
"Confronting Traumatic Brain Injury : Devastation, Hope, And Healing",['William J. Winslade'],"William Winslade presents facts about traumatic brain injury; information about its financial and emotional costs to individuals, families, and society; and key ethical and policy issues. He illustrates each aspect with dramatic case studies, including his own childhood brain injury. He explains how the brain works and how severe injuries affect it, both immediately and over the long term, pointing out how resources are often squandered on patients with poor prognoses but adequate insurance, while underinsured patients with better prognoses often do not receive the best care. He describes the lack of regulation in the rehabilitation industry and what federal and state legislatures are doing to correct the situation. And he recommends policy changes for lowering the instances of traumatic brain injury such as raising the minimum driving age as well as practical steps that individuals can take to protect themselves from brain trauma. William J. Winslade is James Wade Rockwell Professor of Philosophy in Medicine at the Institute for the Medical Humanities, professor of preventive medicine and community health, and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

South Africa's war against capitalism,['Walter E. Williams'],"Williams begins with a brief overview of South African history, the racial and ethnic diversity of its peoples, and the development of thinking about apartheid. He then highlights some of South Africa's legal institutions, particularly its racially discriminatory laws, and traces the historical forces behind racially discriminatory labor law. Subsequent chapters apply standard economic analysis to apartheid in business and the labor market and consider market challenges to apartheid and governmental responses. Finally, Williams summarizes recent changes to apartheid laws and offers a general discussion of the lessons about racial relations that can be drawn from the South African experience."
"Telling Stories, Writing Songs: An Album Of Texas Songwriters","['Hudson, Kathleen , 1945-']","Willie Nelson, Joe Ely, Marcia Ball, Tish Hinojosa, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Lyle Lovett . . . the list of popular songwriters from Texas just goes on and on. In this collection of thirty-four interviews with these and other songwriters, Kathleen Hudson pursues the stories behind the songs, letting the singers' own words describe where their songs come from and how the diverse, eclectic cultures, landscapes, and musical traditions of Texas inspire the creative process.<br>
 Conducted in dance halls, dressing rooms, parking lots, clubs--wherever the musicians could take time to tell their stories--the interviews are refreshingly spontaneous and vivid. Hudson draws out the songwriters on such topics as the sources of their songs, the influence of other musicians on their work, the progress of their careers, and the nature of Texas music. Many common threads emerge from these stories, while the uniqueness of each songwriter becomes equally apparent. To round out the collection, Hudson interviews Larry McMurtry and Darrell Royal for their perspectives as longtime friends and fans of Texas musicians. She also includes a brief biography and discography of each songwriter.<br>"
Stolen Childhood: Slave Youth In Nineteenth-century America,['Wilma King'],"Wilma King sheds light on a long-overlooked aspect of slavery in the United States - the wretched lives of the millions of young people enslaved in the nineteenth-century South. A substantial body of scholarship examines the history of U.S. slavery, but it has not focused on these children and their place in enslaved families and the slave community. Wilma King argues that childhood was stolen from these youngsters - they were forced into the workplace at an early age, subjected to arbitrary plantation authority and punishment, and were separated from family. For this exhaustive study, King draws on a wide range of sources, including government records and many unpublished archival materials. This volume tells the story of these children and youth, adding their experience to the history of slavery in the United States.

The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica,['Sterling Evans'],"With over 25 percent of its land set aside in national parks and other protected areas, Costa Rica is renowned worldwide as the green republic. In this very readable history of conservation in Costa Rica, Sterling Evans explores the establishment of the country's national park system as a response to the rapid destruction of its tropical ecosystems due to the expansion of export-related agriculture.<br> Drawing on interviews with key players in the conservation movement, as well as archival research, Evans traces the emergence of a conservation ethic among Costa Ricans and the tangible forms it has taken. In Part I, he describes the development of the national park system and the grand contradiction that conservation occurred simultaneously with massive deforestation in unprotected areas. In Part II, he examines other aspects of Costa Rica's conservation experience, including the important roles played by environmental education and nongovernmental organizations, campesino and indigenous movements, ecotourism, and the work of the National Biodiversity Institute.<br>"

Women In Television News Revisited: Into The Twenty-first Century,['Judith Marlane'],"Women in television news have made great strides in the past twenty-five years. No longer limited to being the token pretty face on the nightly newscast, women have taken their places as working journalists in newsrooms, on the campaign trail, in war zones, and in the highest echelons of network news management. Barbara Walters and Connie Chung have even occupied the coveted network anchor's chair, if only briefly.<br>
 In this book, 70 of the foremost women in television news reflect on their professional successes, the personal and professional sacrifices that often bought those successes, and the barriers that still confront women in the news business. Weaving their interviews into a compelling text, Judith Marlane covers a wide range of issues, including looks versus ability and experience, sexual harassment, the resistance to women news anchors, the difficulties of balancing work and family life, women's and men's salaries, and the willingness of women to help other women in the business.<br>
 This book builds from Marlane's 1976 work, Women in Television News. Interviews with many of the same women highlight the gains that women have made in broadcast journalism. Simultaneously, Marlane has expanded her range of informants to include fifteen of America's most famous male anchors and correspondents to gather their assessments of the role of women in broadcasting today.<br>"

Henry F. Du Pont And Winterthur: A Daughter`s Portrait,['Ruth Lord'],"World renowned for its vast woodland gardens, its 175-room house, and its unrivaled collection of American decorative arts, Winterthur in Delaware is today among the most beloved museums in the United States. In its earlier days Winterthur was the family home where Ruth du Pont Lord grew up and where her father, Henry F. du Pont (1880-1969), envisioned and then brought to fruition his great museum of Americana. In this memoir, Ruth Lord engagingly describes the development of Henry F. du Pont from a shy, lonely child, a seemingly hopeless student, to a man who went on to achieve singular distinction in three disparate fields-as art connoisseur, horticulturist, and eminent cattle breeder. Based on her personal experience, and on extraordinary family archives, the author provides a behind-the-scenes view of the legendary lifestyle of the du Pont family, brings to life other family members, including her brilliant mother and her irrepressible aunt, Louise Crowninshield, and tells of her father's many additional activities, which culminated in his leadership role in Jacqueline Kennedy's White House restoration.
