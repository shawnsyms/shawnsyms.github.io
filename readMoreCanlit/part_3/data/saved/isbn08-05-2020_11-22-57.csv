""Growing up poor and angry, Michael Corbitt fought his way up the ranks of greasers and street gangs until he attracted the attention of Chicago crime boss Sam Giancana, who placed him on the Willow Springs, Illinois, police force. By the time he was appointed chief of police, he'd also moved up the Outfit's ranks and was living the high life of a respected mobster."" ""Corbitt's luck turned when he was indicted on charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit murder.

<p>Author Biography:</p>
<p>Megan Whalen Turner, author of <i>The Thief</i> (a Newbery Honor winner) and <i>Instead of Three Wishes,</i> lives in Menlo Park, California. In Her Own Words...</p>
<p>""When I was ten I read a lot of great books, and when I couldn't easily find more, I decided I would be a writer and write stories of my own, even though it didn't sound as exciting as reading. The only impediment to beginning my career right then was that I couldn't think of anything to write.</p>
<p>""Joan Aiken said she saw stories all around her, prompted by everyday events. She also said (in her bio) that she'd been telling stories since birth and completed her first novel in Latin class when she was seventeen. And there I was ten years old without a rag of a story to call my own. Roald Dahl said he kept a notebook in which he scribbled his ideas so that he wouldn't forget them. This sounded sensible and I gave it a try. When I forced one out, it sounded like this: Write a story about a blind girl who wants to go to school and be like everybody else.</p>
<p>""Well, that idea just sat there on the page. It did not magically turn into a story the wayit was supposed to. (Or if it did, it was somebody else's story: <i>Light a Single Candle.</i>) So much for Roald Dahl.</p>
<p>""I let the matter drop, I didn't write anything, and I didn't think very much about it again until I was in my third year of college when I had to choose a field and begin a senior project. I thought that writing had to be easier than sifting down to read, say, The Mill on the Floss, and I proposed to study children's literature and write some of my own.</p>
<p>""What I produced was almost uniformly horrible, but I think that was because I didn't want to write anything that wasn't perfect and nothing comes out perfect the first time. I think that anyone who wants to write well has to write copiously first. But I didn't know that then, so I gave up on writing and spent seven years as a children's book buyer in various bookstores. Then my husband, who is a professor of English, got a grant to do research for a year in California and I left my job to go with him. I thought that if I didn't set myself to do something constructive, I might end up reading, say, <i>The Mill on the Floss,</i> so I decided again to write, and I did. I produced short stories that I sent to Diana Wynne Jones. She recommended that I send them to Susan Hirschman at Greenwillow, who agreed to publish them, to my surprise. I had intended them as writing samples, hoping to interest Greenwillow in a novel if I ever wrote one.</p>
<p>""This was so easy and so surprising that it might contradict what I said earlier about a writer needing to write a lot before writing well, but I realize, in retrospect, I did write a lot-English compositions, answers to essay questions on science homework, college papers, and thankyou notes. Especially thank-you notes. My mother always supervised mine and she had high standards. In fact, my advice to anyone who wants to be a writer is to avoid reading any other author's biography. Spend your time on your thank-you notes.""</p>


                        <p>Gen flaunts his ingenuity as a thief and relishes the adventure which takes him to a remote temple of the gods where he will attempt to steal a precious stone.

Afschineh and her three siblings were left in the care of their mother, who did everything in her power to free her husband from jail, and who struggled to survive in a newly fundamentalist society that was openly hostile to women."" ""In the torturous weeks and months that followed, Mrs. Latifi and her husband communicated by writing notes to each other on tiny squares of paper, and bribing the guards to pass them back and forth."" ""In late May, Colonel Latifi was executed, shot with little fanfare on a prison rooftop, and the story begins. Fearing for the safety of her daughters, Mrs. Latifi made a heartrending decision: She sent Afschineh and her sister, Afsaneh, abroad, knowing it might be years before she embraced them again - if ever.""

9780060504083,Small Wonder: Essays,['Barbara Kingsolver'],"""In her new essay collection, the beloved author of High Tide in Tucson brings to us from one of history's darker moments an extended love song to the world we still have. From its opening parable gleaned from recent news about a lost child saved in an astonishing way, the book moves on to consider a world of surprising and hopeful prospects, ranging from an inventive conservation scheme in a remote jungle to the backyard flock of chickens tended by the author's small daughter."" Whether she is contemplating the Grand Canyon, her vegetable garden, motherhood, adolescence, genetic engineering, TV-watching, the history of civil rights, or the future of a nation founded on the best of all human impulses, these essays are grounded in the author's belief that our largest problems have grown from the earth's remotest corners as well as our own backyards, and that answers may lie in those places, too. In the voice Kingsolver's readers have come to rely on - sometimes grave, occasionally hilarious, and ultimately persuasive - Small Wonder is a hopeful examination of the people we seem to be, and what we might yet make of ourselves."

To make matters worse, Renie's up to her latest eyebrow wax in debt, due to overzealous spending on clothes on their recent trip to San Francisco. And in the house that Herself - Judith's nemesis and hubby Joe's ex-wife - has rented out, there dwells a symphony violinist whose practice of outdoor practicing au naturel is driving the neighbors out of the cozy cul-de-sac and into soundproof rooms. In fact, they swear they'd like to kill the nude, rude Rudi."" ""No such luck. The only buffer zone from the in-the-buff violinist is the Rankerses' hedge. Instead of Rudi taking a final bow with his damnable bow, it's his larger-than-life mentor, Dolph Kluger, who meets death, not by getting entangled in the lethal laurel, but from ingesting ruthless rhubarb."" To add to the musical mess, Rudi's valuable violin bow goes missing, Renie's useless credit cards are stolen, a headless horseman rides through somebody's past, and several suspects seem to be on the brink of bonkersville. Judith has to be extra careful with these lyrical loonies or somebody will be playing her funeral march before the killer bows out."

And in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Sparks makes a startling announcement: They are changing course for Africa because someone is pursuing them. Someone who wants them dead.""

Working from Roy's swank apartment, Banks makes the rounds to Roy's old haunts and slowly inhabits the life of his younger brother - the black sheep of the family, who always seemed to sail a little too close to the wind. As the trail of clues about Roy's life and associations draws Banks into a dark circle of conspiracy and corruption, mobsters and murder, Banks suddenly realizes he's running out of time to save Roy, and by digging too deep, he may be exposing himself and his family to the same - possibly deadly - danger."

This assertion by racing pioneer Junior Johnson best describes the rapid evolution of stock car racing. The races, which began as battles for bragging rights among bootleggers in the Deep South to see who had the fastest car, have become a multimillion-dollar sport associated with dozens of major corporations and numerous television networks. Long gone is the overriding image of good ol' boys running moonshine; NASCAR has become a glamorous, upscale, and thriving business throughout the country, a passion shared by millions of Americans who closely follow the Winston Cup series. With thirty-one races on the 1993 schedule at tracks from Watkins Glen, New York, to Sears Point, California, NASCAR reaffirms that there is nothing more at the root of the American mindset than cars. With capacity crowds at each event, the races have been described as a middle-aged Woodstock - only instead of rock and roll it's a celebration of fast cars and American tradition. American Zoom is the first and only book to capture the true flavor of this homegrown pastime. Peter Golenbock, with six bestsellers to his name, has earned a reputation as one of the most successful and respected sports authors. In his tumultuous histories of the New York Yankees (Dynasty, The Bronx Zoo, and Balls) and Brooklyn Dodgers (Bums), his revelatory and controversial book with Billy Martin (Number 1), and his expose of the North Carolina State basketball program (Personal Fouls), Golenbock has changed our perceptions of sports. Now, having spent a year and a half talking with all the main players of NASCAR, Golenbock offers an oral history as told by the great drivers, mechanics, promoters, and others who have made the sport what it is today, talking about the people and cars who have made racing history. American Zoom is also the consummate insider's book, profiling the character"

[In it] we find the heart of Kierkagaard. It is not innocuous, not genteel, not comfortable. He does not invite the reader to realx and have a little laugh with him at the expense of other people or at his own foibles. Kierkegaard deliberately challenges the reader's whole existence.
<p>""Nor does he merely challenge our <u>existence;</u> he also questions some ideas that had become well entrenched in his time and that are even more characteristic of the present age. Kierkegaard insists, for example, that Christianity was from the start essentially authoritarian--not just that the Catholic Church was, or that Calvin was, or Luther, or, regrettably, most of the Christian churches, but that Christ was--and is. Indeed, though Kierkegaard was, and wished to be, an individual, and even said that on his tombstone he would like no other epitaph than 'That Individual,' his protest against his age was centered in his lament over the loss of authority."" --Walter Kaufman, in the <u>Introduction</u></p>

But when he begins to feel the urge to become a father, he starts to wonder if his chosen lifestyle can ever make him happy. His flatmates, the eccentric, maternal Sadie and the stoic, supportive Bobby, encourage Tommy to tone down his lifestyle a wee bit and accept the fact that he's got to grow up sometime. His boyfriend, Charlie (whose son, Finn, is the epitome of childhood charm), wishes that Tommy could make a real commitment to their relationship. But can he?</p>

When she injects herself with this miracle DNA, the bone cancer that is slowly killing her doesn't just go into remission, it vanishes completely. It seems the DNA has the ability to repair damaged genes, to heal the sick, to cure incurable diseases. And much to her surprise, Charlotte discovers that now she possesses these very powers."" But someone wants those bones - and Charlotte. Rabbi Aaron Cohen - a descendent of the biblical Aaron and the high priests of the long-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem - foresees a time when Jerusalem's Temple Mount is cleared of the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque and replaced with the Third Temple. And for Cohen, that time is now. Cohen's family has been the guardian of the Ark of the Covenant for many years and he is ready to retrieve the Ark from its hiding place and bring it back to Jerusalem to unleash its awesome power. He has only one problem - he cannot touch the Ark because his bloodline isn't pure. Charlotte, her blood now purified by Jesus Christ's own DNA, is kidnapped and brought to Israel in order to open the Ark."

He had never spoken in public before. His mind was flooded with childhood memories filled with humiliation, misunderstanding, and abuse at the hands of his teachers. With his heart pounding, he began to speak of these incidents. To his disbelief, the teachers before him responded to his embittered recollection with a standing ovation. Many could not contain their own tears."" ""So begins a touching memoir of an extremely angry adolescent. Highly gifted and imaginative, Villasenor coped with an untreated learning disability (he was finally diagnosed with extreme dyslexia at the age of forty-four) and the frustration he felt growing up Latino in an English-only American school system that had neither the cultural understanding nor the resources to deal with Hispanic students."" Often beaten by his teachers because he could not speak English, Villasenor was made to feel ashamed about his heritage, and even questioned the core values prioritized by his tight-knit family. Villasenor's dyslexia, and growing frustration over not fitting in, fueled his dream to one day become a writer. He is now considered one of the premier writers of our time."

<p>Reaching back to earliest times, Martin Ewans examines the historical evolution of one of today's most dangerous breeding grounds of global terrorism. After a succession of early dynasties and the emergence of an Afghan empire during the eighteenth century, the nineteenth and early twentieth century saw a fierce power struggle between Russia and Britain for supremacy in Afghanistan that was ended by the nation's proclamation of independence in 1919. A communist coup in the late 1970s overthrew the established regime and led to the invasion of Soviet troops in 1979. Roughly a decade later, the Soviet Union withdrew, condemning Afghanistan to a civil war that tore apart the nation's last remnants of religious, ethnic, and political unity. It was into this climate that the Taliban was born.</p>
<p>Today, war-torn and economically destitute, Afghanistan faces unique challenges as it looks toward an uncertain future. Martin Ewans carefully weighs the lessons of history to provide a frank look at Afghanistan's prospects and the international resonances of the nation's immense task of total political and economic reconstruction.</p>"

9780030234538,The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn,['Holt'],"<b>About the Author</b><br>
<br>
Samuel Langhorne Clemens, or Mark Twain, as he was better known was born on November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri, the sixth child of John Marshall and Jane Lampton Clemens. His father ran a dry goods and grocery store, practiced law and involved himself in local politics after the family's move to Hannibal, Missouri, when Sam was four years old.<br>
<br>
Hannibal seems to have been a good place for a boy to grow up. Sam was entranced by the Mississippi River and enjoyed both the barges and the people who traveled on them. When Sam was just eleven his father died and Sam went to work for his brother at the <i>Hannibal Journal</i> first as a printer's apprentice and later a compositor. While still in his teens Sam went on the road as an itinerant printer. In 1857 he conceived a plan to seek his fortune in South America but on the way he met a steamboat captain, Horace Bixby who took him on as a cub riverboat pilot and taught him until he acquired his own license.<br>
<br>
This enjoyable style of life, which Twain always spoke of later with special warmth was ended by the Civil War. Twain went west with his brother Orion to prospect in Nevada but in 1862 joined the staff of the Virginia City <i>Territorial Enterprise</i>, a paper to which he had already begun submitting his work. Later Twain went to California and submitted ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"" to the <i>New York Saturday Press</i>.<br>
<br>
By 1871 Twain had published <i>Innocents Abroad</i> and had married Olivia Langdon, the sister of a friend from a socially prominent New York City family. He and his wife moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where they made their family home for thenext 20 years.<br>
<br>
Books that he wrote in Hartford confirmed his popular reputation but despite their success Twain found himself in financial difficulty primarily because of his investments in the Paige typesetting business as well as his own publishing company. Eventually Twain was forced to declare bankruptcy.<br>
<br>
Twain's last major books were successful commercially but they also reflect his increasing pessimism. His satire becomes at times more biting and mean-spirited than it is humorous. Despite the downturn in Twain's outlook in later life and despite the unevenness of much of his work, he remains one of the major writers of the American nineteenth century, and one who has been enormously influential on subsequent writers.

Nothing before this groundbreaking book has captured the real experience of breast cancer. It is essential reading for any woman with this diagnosis.</p>
<p><b>I Am Not My Breast Cancer</b> offers women the companionship of other women dealing with this disease. Ruth Peltason, who has twice undergone treatment for breast cancer, has woven their stories together while maintaining the authenticity of their voices. These are ordinary women dealing with this cancer and its many ramifications. They range in age from their early twenties to their late seventies. They are the collective face of breast cancer today. Their comments are moving, sometimes funny, always honest. They speak out on every topic, from lovemaking and intimacy to losing their hair, from juggling the day-to-day realities of being a patient, mother, wife, and coworker to the overwhelming worries about their own mortality. Remarkably, they emerge with grace and optimism and a determination not to be defined by disease.</p>
<p>Taking the reader chronologically through the stages of diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and self-discovery, <b>I Am Not My Breast Cancer</b> offers women a deeper understanding of themselves and living with cancer. As Peltason writes in her introduction, ""My greatest wish for this book is that it offer comfort to any woman living with breast cancer and to those who care about her.

</blockquote>
<p>Alone in an unlocked house in a safe neighborhood in the suburban town of Concord, Massachusetts, two good, obedient girls, Jessica Stern, fifteen, and her sister, fourteen, were raped on the night of October 1, 1973. The girls had just come back from ballet lessons and were doing their homework when a strange man armed with a gun entered their home. Afterward, when they reported the crime, the police were skeptical.</p>
<p>The rapist was never caught. For over thirty years, Stern denied the pain and the trauma of the assault. Following the example of her family, Stern—who lost her mother at the age of three, and whose father was a Holocaust survivor—focused on her work instead of her terror. She became a world-class expert on terrorism, a lauded academic and writer who interviewed terrorists around the globe. But while her career took off, her success hinged on her symptoms. After her ordeal she could not feel fear in normally frightening situations.</p>
<p>Stern believed she'd disassociated from the trauma altogether, until a devoted police lieutenant reopened the sisters' rape case and brought her back to that harrowing night more than three decades past. With the help of the lieutenant, Stern began her own investigation—bringing to bear all her skills as a researcher—to uncover the truth about the town of Concord, her family, and her own mind.

<p>""Sex can be just gorgeous—and sometimes it is the most beautiful thing that can happen between a man and a woman. But don't you also think that it can be just practical? Like when you're hungry and don't want a three-course meal with wine, music, and ambience; you just want a sandwich. You don't love the sandwich. You don't hate the sandwich. You just want to eat the sandwich and feel satisfied.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Pepper Schwartz has always encouraged women to embrace their sexual appetites. After three decades of answering people's questions about their emotional, sexual, and romantic lives; after writing several books on sex and relationships; after thirty-five years as a sociology professor at the University of Washington, she has formed firm opinions about sex and relationships. However, when her own situation changes, when she becomes a single woman after twenty-three years of marriage, she has to reevaluate and discover how sex and dating can work for her at this unique time in her life.</p>
<p>Masters and Johnson, the famous sex researchers concluded that you <b>can</b> have sex, and <b>want</b> sex, way into old age, if you never stop doing it. And Pepper is very sure that she never wants to stop doing it. Now, she must make the effort to put herself in the running—getting in shape physically, emotionally, and spiritually—and figure out ways to meet worthy and available men. Ideally, she would like to have a serious relationship, but if that isn't in the cards, she still wants sex and companionship. And while she may feel as sexually alive as she did when she was twenty-five, the number and availability of men has changed.</p>
<p class=""null1"">So, how do you look for a life partner after fifty and enjoy sexual adventures along the way?</p>
<p><b>Prime</b> is Dr. Pepper's response to this question. It's her story of exploration—sex, adventure, and romance—spread out like a road map for women of every age, because even as she is telling her own tale, she doesn't forget to exercise her talent for advice. Whether you're looking to wake up a tired sex life, start a new relationship, explore cyber-dating, indulge in a four-hand massage, flirt with gigolos on vacation, or commit to the love of your life, you can find tempting tips and genuinely helpful guidance.</p>
<p>The prime of life has lengthened and as Dr. Pepper's experiences show, it would be wrong not to live every moment to the fullest. Calling for a brave and creative reevaluation of what is possible in the second half of women's lives, <b>Prime</b> invites every woman to relish her sexuality, take risks, and go after what she really wants—whether it's a sandwich or something substantially more satisfying. . . .</p>"

<p>With the unflinching candor and sym­pathy for which Joyce Carol Oates is celebrated, these fourteen stories examine the intimate lives of contemporary American families: the tangled ties between generations, the desperation—and the covert, radiant happiness—of loving more than one is loved in return. In ""Cutty Sark"" and ""Landfill,"" the bond between adolescent son and mother reverberates with the force of an unspoken passion, bringing unexpected consequences for the son. In ""A Princeton Idyll,"" a woman is forced to realize, decades later, her childhood role in the destruction of a famous, beloved grandfather's life. In ""Magda Maria,"" a man tries to break free of the enthralling and dangerous erotic obsession of his life. In the gripping title story, Oates boldly reimagines the true-crime story of Andrea Yates, the Texas mother who drowned her children in 2001. Several stories—""Suicide by Fitness Center,"" ""The Glazers,"" and ""Dear Joyce Carol,""—take a less tragic turn, exploring with mordant humor the shadowy interstices between self-awareness and delusion.</p>

<p><i>The Hunger</i> is an insider's romp through the crazy life of the restaurant business, told by a journeyman chef who fought his way to the top. Trapped in a dead-end job, John DeLucie called it quits and invested his meager savings in a ten-week cooking class. Upon completion, armed with no professional experience and the barest of basic skills, he walked into the renowned gourmet shop Dean &amp; DeLuca and asked for a job. The next day he found himself chopping forty pounds of onions in the prep-kitchen basement. A glamorous new chapter had begun. DeLucie worked his way up the bumpy NYC food chain, from executive chef at La Bottega to Nick &amp; Toni's in East Hampton, eventually finding his way to The Waverly Inn, which he opened with publishing magnate Graydon Carter and several partners. It was here that John married his mastery of simple but unique flavors with Carter's A+ list of glitterati to create downtown's hottest eatery.</p>
<p><i>The Hunger</i> tracks John though the pitfalls of cooking for a living, as well as the roller-coaster ride that became his personal life. Woven into the grit are the stories behind some of DeLucie's signature recipes, including New York's ""Best High-End Burger"" and the now famous truffled mac and cheese. Here is John's tale about food, desire, and appetite—and how one person overcame all odds to make it in the fiercely competitive world of food.</p>"

<p>The Arctic—like the canary in the coal mine—has reacted more quickly and dramatically to global warming than many had anticipated. Hundreds of scientists are urgently trying to predict just how the Arctic will change and how those changes will in turn affect the rest of the planet. But plenty of other people, driven by profit rather than data, are interested as well. The riches of the world’s last virgin territory have spurred the reawakening of old geopolitical rivalries. The United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, and the Danish territory of Greenland all control areas around the Arctic Ocean. We face a new era of oil rigs and drill ships, of tankers taking shortcuts from Yokohama to Rotterdam, as well as a potential fight over the Arctic’s treasures.</p>
<p>Alongside the winners from an open Arctic sea are the many losers, from the nomadic reindeer herders of Siberia and Scandinavia to the Inuit hunters of Alaska, Greenland, and Canada. Other creatures that rely on the vast expanses of sea ice, including seals, birds, and whales—and the ecosystems within which they live—may disappear to be replaced by different creatures.</p>

<p>After the fall of France in June 1940, London became the center of world political theater. For the U.S. president, the vital question was: could Britain, with American help, hold out against the might of Nazi Germany? While keeping the United States officially neutral, Franklin D. Roosevelt devised an unprecedented strategy, leading to the revolutionary idea of lend-lease. But was Winston Churchill—famous as a speechmaker but regarded by many as a reckless politician and possibly a drunk—a good bet? To find the answer, Roosevelt dispatched his closest associate, Harry Hopkins, to Britain on a mission. Hopkins's endorsement of Churchill put an end to FDR's doubts, and with the passage of the Lend-Lease Act the president sent Averell Harriman, a wealthy financier and entrepreneur, to London ""to keep the British Isles afloat."" For Harriman, the assignment turned out to be the great adventure of a remarkable life.</p>

Don't send cash, as the post often gets stolen. Send a cheque.<br>
I am your mother.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Gert Hardcastle is thirty-something and unlucky in love. She is also estranged from her mother, Jean. As <b>Crocodile Soup</b> opens, she thinks she has found ""the One""—the enigmatic Eva, who serves coffee in the cafeteria in the museum where Gert works as a curator cataloging Egyptian artifacts. As Gert embarks on her hilarious and poignant pursuit of Eva, she looks back on her eccentric childhood and her relationship with Jean through a series of vivid and surreal flashbacks.</p>
<p>As she revisits her past, Gert brings to life the bizarre and endearing members of her family: her obsessive twin, Frank, with whom she communicates telepathically; her father, George, who vanishes to Africa to salvage the family crocodile farm; her vain, neglectful mother, Jean; and the family ghost—a Victorian poet who haunts the attic. Gert's story is punctuated by terse, intriguing letters from jean to which she does not respond, and ambiguous encounters with Eva.</p>
<p>In her struggle to come to terms with her mother, Gert opens up to Eva, and begins to understand more about her past. Is Gert destined to remain the scaffolding for those around her or will she find her savior? In a lyrical narrative studded with relentless humor and giddy self-deprecation, Julia Darling introduces an irresistible cast of characters whose shared story is unforgettable.</p>"

9780061170881,Reinventing Gravity: A Physicist Goes Beyond Einstein,['John W. Moffat'],"<blockquote>
<p>Einstein's gravity theory—his general theory of relativity—has served as the basis for a series of astonishing cosmological discoveries. But what if, nonetheless, Einstein got it wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the 1930s, physicists have noticed an alarming discrepancy between the universe as we see it and the universe that Einstein's theory of relativity predicts. There just doesn't seem to be enough stuff out there for everything to hang together. Galaxies spin so fast that, based on the amount of visible matter in them, they ought to be flung to pieces, the same way a spinning yo-yo can break its string. Cosmologists tried to solve the problem by positing dark matter—a mysterious, invisible substance that surrounds galaxies, holding the visible matter in place—and particle physicists, attempting to identify the nature of the stuff, have undertaken a slew of experiments to detect it. So far, none have.</p>
<p>Now, John W. Moffat, a physicist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, offers a different solution to the problem. The cap­stone to a storybook career—one that began with a correspondence with Einstein and a conversation with Niels Bohr—Moffat's modified gravity theory, or MOG, can model the movements of the universe without recourse to dark matter, and his work chal­lenging the constancy of the speed of light raises a stark challenge to the usual models of the first half-million years of the universe's existence.</p>
<p>This bold new work, presenting the entirety of Moffat's hypothesis to a general readership for the first time, promises to overturn everything we thought we knew about the origins and evolution of the universe.</p>"

<p>In a heyday of reality television and overnight stardom, it's easy to forget that most players had to work hard to make it big. <b>How I Broke into Hollywood</b> brings together dozens of Tinseltown's greatest success stories, from legends Sydney Pollack and Lalo Schifrin to rising starlet Erika Christensen to über-producer Gavin Polone. Icons of their industry — writers, actors, directors, designers, cinematographers, executives and more — they were once outsiders themselves, and their beginnings have all the grit and glamour of the best Hollywood films. Among the figures profiled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comedian Bernie Mac, whose earliest stand-up shows were on subway cars and at funeral parties.</li>
<li>Actor Charles Dutton, who was convicted of manslaughter at age seventeen, then went on to the Yale School of Drama and a brilliant career on stage, screen, and television.</li>
<li>Actor Peter Gallagher, who suffered a crippling bout of stage fright moments before leaping onstage as Snoopy — but whose jitters moved him to a performance that brought the audience to its feet and launched his career.</li>
<li>Superagent Jay Kanter, who started out as a mailroom guy — before nabbing Marlon Brando as his first star client.</li>
<li>Producer Caryn Mandabach, whose first job was making beer runs for the production guys at the Olympic Auditorium — but who paid attention and soon was developing such hits as The Cosby Show, Roseanne, and That '70s Show.</li>
<li>Director John Landis, who hunted down his first job as a production assistant by buying a one-way ticket to London, then hitchhiking and hopping trains all the way to the set . . . in Yugoslavia.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How I Broke into Hollywood</b> shares the voices of nearly fifty Hollywood survivors as they revisit the highs and lows of their careers in their own words, dishing dirt and imparting the wisdom they gained along the way.

9780061873805,Death By Liberalism: The Fatal Outcome Of Well-meaning Liberal Policies,['J. R. Dunn'],"<blockquote>
<p>More Americans have been killed by well-meaning liberal policies than by all the wars of the last century combined. J. R. Dunn not only analyzes the unintended consequences of liberal policies, but argues that these consequences have resulted in millions of fatalities in the United States and around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Liberalism sees itself as a rational and helpful philosophy that seeks to use the benign power of the government to improve our safety, health, and general welfare. In doing so, it relies on the authority of experts to devise the most rational means of realizing these goals. Unfortunately, when these well-meaning plans go awry, as they too often do, the results can be disastrous, even deadly. As J. R. Dunn persuasively argues in this thoroughly documented book, death by liberalism occurs in all fields and at all levels of society. Motorists, workers, even children taken under the state's protection—all have fallen victim to liberal policies. What's more, the numbers are staggering. Liberalism can be implicated in the deaths of hundreds of thousands in this country, and millions worldwide.</p>
<p>Dunn's detailed and deliberative account takes no cheap shots but relies on well-established facts to show liberalism's fatal consequences in numerous aspects of our lives—from crime and abortion to fuel-efficiency standards and the banning of DDT, from gun control to urban renewal. Dunn also pinpoints areas in which liberal interventions in the making are likely to produce more suffering and death, such as legal euthanasia, and identifies some of the leading liberals—including George Soros—behind the spread of these lethal initiatives.</p>"

I had no idea how I'd wound up there, but I knew it was exactly where I belonged.</p>
<p><b>The Pioneer Woman Cooks</b> is a homespun collection of photography, rural stories, and scrumptious recipes that have defined my experience in the country. I share many of the delicious cowboy-tested recipes I've learned to make during my years as an accidental ranch wife—including Rib-Eye Steak with Whiskey Cream Sauce, Lasagna, Fried Chicken, Patsy's Blackberry Cobbler, and Cinnamon Rolls—not to mention several ""cowgirl-friendly"" dishes, such as Sherried Tomato Soup, Olive Cheese Bread, and Crème Brûlée. I show my recipes in full color, step-by-step detail, so it's as easy as pie to follow along.</p>
<p>You'll also find colorful images of rural life: cows, horses, country kids, and plenty of chaps-wearing cowboys.</p>
<p>I hope you get a kick out of this book of mine. I hope it makes you smile. I hope the recipes bring you recognition, accolades, and marriage proposals. And I hope it encourages even the most harried urban cook to slow down, relish the joys of family, nature, and great food, and enjoy life.</p>"

<p>Nearly three years have passed since that tragic day in September. Since then, our wounds have healed, but our senses and memories have dulled.</p>
<p>At first, the nation rallied behind its leader. But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.</p>
<p>Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.</p>
<p>How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?</p>
<p>—from <b>Deliver Us from Evil</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the <b>New York Times</b> bestseller <b>Let Freedom Ring</b>, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful <b>Hannity &amp; Colmes</b> on the Fox News Channel and <b>The Sean Hannity Show</b> on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad — and liberalism at home — in <b>Deliver Us from Evil</b>.</p>
<p>""Evil exists,"" Hannity asserts. ""It is real, and it means to harm us."" And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party — from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless ""multilateralism"" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century.</p>"

<p>The definitive account of Wall Street's stunning collapse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From critically acclaimed investigative journalist and CNBC personality Charles Gasparino comes a sweeping examination of the most recent volatile, anxiety-ridden era in our nation's socioeconomic history. <b>The Sellout</b> traces the implosion of the financial services business back to its roots in the late 1970s when Wall Street embraced a new business model predicated on taking enormous risks. It shows how a backwater business involving the trading of risky bonds packed with mortgages showered countless billions in profits on the financial industry but sowed the seeds of its ultimate demise. Gasparino walks readers through Wall Street's three-decades' love affair with risk, revealing a trail of culpability—from the government bureaucrats who crafted housing policies that encouraged homeownership, to the Wall Street firms that underwrote and invested in risky debt, to the mortgage sellers who handed out loans to people without the financial wherewithal to pay them back, to the homeowners who became convinced they could afford mansions on blue-collar wages. The ongoing tumult in financial markets and the global economy began when some of our most esteemed financial institutions, our government, and even average citizens abdicated their collective responsibilities, eventually selling out investors and selling off the American Dream itself.</p>
<p>In the spirit of classics such as <b>Barbarians at the Gate</b> and <b>Liar's Poker</b>, this page-turning narrative captures how avarice, arrogance, and sheer stupidity eroded Wall Street's dominance and profoundly weakened the financial security of millions of middle-class Americans. Eye-opening and engrossing, <b>The Sellout</b> provides the most thorough investigation to date of this latest gilded era.</p>"

<p>The first accessible book on a theory of physics that explains the relationship between the particles and forces that make up our universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For decades, physicists have been fascinated with the possibility that two seemingly independent aspects of our world—matter and force—may in fact be intimately connected and inseparable facets of nature. This idea, known as supersymmetry, is considered by many physicists to be one of the most beautiful and elegant theories ever conceived. According to this theory, however, there is much more to our universe than we have witnessed thus far. In particular, supersymmetry predicts that for each type of particle there must also exist others, called superpartners. To the frustration of many particle physicists, no such superpartner particles have ever been observed. As the world's most powerful particle accelerator—the Large Hadron Collider—begins operating in 2008, this may be about to change. By discovering the forms of matter predicted by supersymmetry, this incredible machine is set to transform our current understanding of the universe's laws and structure, and overturn the way that we think about matter, force, space, and time.</p>
<p><b>Nature's Blueprint</b> explores the reasons why supersymmetry is so integral to how we understand our world and describes the incredible machines used in the search for it. In an engaging and accessible style, it gives readers a glimpse into the symmetries, patterns, and very structure behind the universe and its laws.</p>"

<p>In a book that's part advice and part exposé, psy­chologist and expert on boyhood development Dr. Anthony Rao challenges some of the potentially harmful assumptions, attitudes, and behaviors we've developed toward young boyhood over the last few decades. This is not an indictment of medication therapies—in some important instances, Dr. Rao argues that medication is appropriate and necessary. Rather, <b>The Way of Boys</b> is a celebration of natural, constructive boyhood development and an expert, definitive handbook on what to look for and expect in normal growth. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is his behavior serious enough to interfere with functioning? Does it keep him from sleeping, eating, attending school, or staying safe?</p>
<p>Does it persist over a few weeks or more? Does it show itself more than a few isolated times per day?</p>
<p>Does it happen in different settings? Has it been reported by different people?</p>

<p>If your answer is yes to any of these, your son may have symptoms that need further assessment by a pediatrician or other qualified developmental specialist. But a yes answer doesn't mean your son has a lifelong disorder or that the first line of defense is medication.</p>

Have you consulted numerous doctors, and been prescribed drugs and diets that have only temporarily alleviated some symptoms? If so, you may have celiac disease, a hereditary autoimmune condition that affects nearly one in every hundred people—97 percent of whom remain undiagnosed and untreated.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people, the real answer to your medical problems may lie in this book. Dr. Peter Green, director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University and internationally renowned expert on the disease, together with Rory Jones, an accomplished science writer who was diagnosed with the disease in 1998 and has been researching it ever since, have written the first and only authoritative guide on how celiac disease is properly diagnosed, treated, and managed. The disease is triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten damages the lining of the small intestine so that it cannot properly absorb food. Without essential nutrients, the entire body begins to suffer. Complications from celiac disease can include infertility, depression, liver disease, other autoimmune diseases (such as type 1 diabetes and thyroid disease), and even cancer. This is a disease that you do <b>not</b> outgrow. At present, the only way to treat it is to follow a lifelong gluten-free diet.</p>
<p>This revised and updated edition contains the most current information on celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and gluten sensitivity. It examines the disease's many manifestations and includes an entire section devoted to coping with the psychological aspects of living with a chronic illness and the gluten-free diet. There is new information about testing for the disease; a closer look at the causes, as well as related conditions; the latest scientific research toward a cure; an updated guide to ingredients and safe grains; and an expanded list of gluten-free manufacturers and national and international support groups.</p>

In August 1936, in front of Hitler and an imposing phalanx of Nazi commanders, Jesse Owens, the fastest man on earth, won an unprecedented four medals at the Olympic Games in Berlin. Two years later, in the fight of the century, his great friend Joe Louis crushed Germany's Max Schmeling to signal the end of white supremacy in boxing. Like Jesse, Joe had been born to black sharecropping parents in a country demeaned by racism; together their victories became a rallying point for the disenfranchised black population of America. Idolized across the world, they were two young men at the pinnacle of their careers who overcame prejudice and fear to achieve their goals. Yet for bothof them, success brought its own perils. In 1938, two years after winning his gold medals in Berlin, Owens was hounded out of amateur sports by the infamously tyrannical Olympic boss Slavery Avery Brundage and, facing financial ruin, he was reduced to running for money against dogs, horses, and even his friend Joe Louis.

This classic two-volume history is an exciting and revolutionary look at women's history from prehistoric times to the present. Its unique organization focuses on the developments, achievements, and changes in women's roles in society.

Lively and engaging, this new edition takes readers on a fascinating journey through women's history and the changing roles they have played. In addition it is an ideal text for general courses in women's studies and women's history and more specialized courses focusing on women in European history.<br>
Volume Two covers the fifteenth century to the present. Topics include the roles of female monarchs and women of the court; the application of the new tools of the Scientific Revolution to prove traditional views of women; the salons and parlors of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and wealthy women's contributions to the arts and social services; the impact of city-living and the Industrial Revolution on women's roles and family life; and the emergence, evolution, and impact of the modern feminist movement.

<p>For her part, Jojo can't deny her growing feelings for Adam. But he's always been such a flirt — he can't possibly be serious about her. Besides, she has George falling all over himself to please her. As the war rages on, Adam's feelings for Jojo grow stronger, but Jojo's determination to resist him does, too. One thing is clear, though: Jojo is a girl who always gets what she wants, sometimes in spite of herself.</p>

9780060393830,Dizzy & Jimmy: My Life With James Dean: A Love Story,['Liz Sheridan'],"<center><b>A long time ago, when I was a young dancer in New York City, I fell in love with Jimmy Dean and he fell in love with me.</b></center>
<p>So begins this beguiling memoir of Liz ""Dizzy"" Sheridan's passionate yet ill-fated romance with the young, magnetic, soon-to-be-supernova James Dean. The year was 1951. Dean had recently arrived in Manhattan in search of Broadway stardom. Sheridan was a tall, graceful aspiring dancer. They met one rainy afternoon in the parlor of the Rehearsal Club, a chaperoned boardinghouse for young actresses — and before long Dizzy and Jimmy were inseparable. Together they hunted for jobs, haunted all-night bars and diners, and gloried in the innocent rebellion of early-'50s bohemian New York. Dizzy Sheridan and James Dean were lovers; they lived together; as even ardent Dean fans may be surprised to learn, they were engaged to be married. But when Dean began to find success on the Broadway stage and then was lured to Hollywood, the couple parted amid tears and broken dreams — dreams that would be dashed forever when Dean died in a car crash in 1955, not long after seeing Dizzy for the last time.</p>
<p><b>Dizzy &amp; Jimmy</b> marks the first time Liz Sheridan has written about this joyous yet ill-starred romance. She brings us closer than we have ever been to the vibrant young actor before he became a Hollywood icon, capturing his unstudied charm, his complicated psyche, the spontaneous delight he took from the world around him, and the passion he invested in his work and life. It is a journey that takes in many locales, from Dean's boyhood home in Fairmount, Indiana, to Sheridan's recuperative travels through the Caribbean after their breakup. But at its heart <b>Dizzy &amp; Jimmy</b> is the story of a love affair with Manhattan — of nights spent stealing kisses in Times Square, sharing a walkup in the Hargrave Hotel, dancing after hours beneath the stars in Grand Central Station. And in Sheridan's bittersweet, embraceable telling, it becomes a story no reader, Dean fan or otherwise, will soon forget.</p>"

Kaplan takes us on a hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking journey through her unique, uncensored world, from her first bungled romantic encounters (<i>No, really, what</i> was <i>I supposed to do?</i>) to her terrifying tropical honeymoon.</p><p>From her first, unsung theatrical experiences at summer camp (<i>I opened the script and saw that I had only one line for the entire first half of the play, and that line consisted of one word,</i> wawa) to a starring role in an independent film (<i>Two months after the film screens in New York, my father-in-law passes away...and it is intimated to me more than once that seeing me locked in an erotic embrace with a black woman hastened his decline.</i>).</p><p>We also meet Kaplan's family, <i>almost</i> lovingly rendered in her razor-sharp prose: Her gadget-obsessed father; her mother, who, if you should want to know, is Fine; her eccentric Florida grandmother (<i>I want you to have this. And this. One day. When I'm dead.</i>); her New York grandmother, with whom she discovers she shares an innate sense of spite (<i>Seething is something one can reasonably do for a lifetime, if one is so inclined</i>); her fearless husband, whom she engages in an ongoing battle over which of them is the most popular person in their apartment; and finally, her vengeful, power-hungry, one-year-old son.</p><p>Kaplan has a wonderfullyoriginal voice, almost painfully precise, and yet, it's a lot like the one in our heads, the one that most of us are only willing to listen to late at night, in the dark, maybe locked in a closet. So what a relief it is that someone <i>finally</i> admits that she is afraid of nearly everything under the sun, including moths; that she is jealous even of people whose lives are on the verge of collapse; and that she has, at times, tried to pass for a gentile (<i>I didn't like carrying the burden of two thousand years of persecution around while everyone else looked so fancy free.</i>)After reading <i>Why I'm Like This,</i> you might just take a good look at your life, (or at the life of a truffle pig, as Kaplan does), and realize that even though it's not perfect, it's yours, and that's something.</p>"

<p>Growing up poor and angry, Michael Corbitt fought his way up the ranks of greasers and street gangs until he attracted the attention of Chicago crime boss Sam Giancana, who placed him on the Willow Springs, Illinois, police force. By the time Corbitt was appointed chief of police, he'd also moved up the Outfit's ranks and was living the high life of a respected mobster.</p>

<p>The civil war brought to a climax the country's bitter division. But the beginnings of slavery's denouement can be traced to a courageous band of ordinary Americans, black and white, slave and free, who joined forces to create what would come to be known as the Underground Railroad, a movement that occupies as romantic a place in the nation's imagination as the Lewis and Clark expedition. The true story of the Underground Railroad is much more morally complex and politically divisive than even the myths suggest. Against a backdrop of the country's westward expansion arose a fierce clash of values that was nothing less than a war for the country's soul. Not since the American Revolution had the country engaged in an act of such vast and profound civil disobedience that not only challenged prevailing mores but also subverted federal law.</p>
<p><b>Bound for Canaan</b> tells the stories of men and women like David Ruggles, who invented the black underground in New York City; bold Quakers like Isaac Hopper and Levi Coffin, who risked their lives to build the Underground Railroad; and the inimitable Harriet Tubman. Interweaving thrilling personal stories with the politics of slavery and abolition, <b>Bound for Canaan</b> shows how the Underground Railroad gave birth to this country's first racially integrated, religiously inspired movement for social change.</p>"

<p>Fuhrman seeks to answer these questions by investigating the death penalty in Oklahoma, where a ""hang 'em high"" attitude of cowboy justice resulted in twenty–one executions in 2001, more than any other state.

9780060737382,The L.a. Shape Diet: The 14-day Total Weight Loss Plan,['David Heber Md  Phd.'],"<p class=""null1"">From one of today's most respected diet and nutrition experts: a 14–day weight loss plan designed to help you change your shape for life using a new breakthrough personalized protein prescription that has worked for thousands of his patients.</p>
<p>Dr. David Heber's groundbreaking book <b>What Color Is Your Diet?</b> introduced us to the Color Code–building a healthy diet based on colorful fruits and vegetables. His new book, <b>The LA Shape Diet</b>, combines the sound nutritional basis of the Color Code with his newest research from the UCLA Center for Nutrition, which shows you how to analyse your body shape, personal protein needs, and metabolism and not only lose weight–but also change your body shape. This has major appeal to the millions of Americans who may be able to lose weight but are still dissatisfied with the look of their bodies–and end up gaining the weight back anyway.</p>
<p>Dr. Heber maintains that everyone is born with a particular shape and that this shape makes a huge difference in how you should approach weight loss. Dr. Heber teaches the difference between the shape you can change and the shape you cannot, and how to do this with the right amount of dietary protein. Based on over 3500 measurements made by his researchers at UCLA, Dr. Heber has come up with tables that estimate how much protein you need in your diet at a given height and weight, and how many calories you should consume every day. Then Dr. Heber helps you build your own ideal diet, starting with protein, then 7 colorful servings of fruits and vegetables (providing 25 grams of filling fiber), and finally whole grains. Dr. Heber explains not only glycemic index (how fast blood sugar goes up) but glycemic load (glycemic index + how much carbohydrate a food provides), which determines how a particular food affects the overall diet. He groups foods into four tables to make it easy for readers to navigate their dinner table.</p>
<p>In a world of dietary fads and ""one size fits all"" pseudo–miracle diets, <b>The LA Shape Diet</b> is the most effective, easy–to–follow, scientifically sound dietary plan you'll find.</p>"

9780061558283,The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt For A Priceless Masterpiece,['Vernon Silver'],"<p class=""null1"">Sotheby's. New York City. June 19, 1990.</p>
<p>Nothing of its kind had been sold to the public in more than a century. On a warm June evening on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with the auction-house showroom crammed with the wealthy, the curious, and the press, history was made when an anonymous man in a green golf sweater paid an unprecedented three quarters of a million dollars to win the twenty-five-hundred-year-old chalice. After that night, this historical artifact disappeared, its whereabouts a mystery. <i>Until now</i>.</p>
<p>It is among the most prized of antiquities: the Greek artist Euphronios's wine cup depicting the death of Zeus's son Sarpedon at Troy. Lost for more than two millennia, the chalice—one of only six of its kind found intact—mysteriously surfaced in the collection of a Hollywood producer, who then sold it to a Texas billionaire. Coveted by obsessed private collectors, dealers, and museum curators, it was also of intense interest to the Italian police, who believed it belonged to their country, where it had first been dug up earlier in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In this breathtaking tale of history, adventure, and intrigue, archaeologist and journalist Vernon Silver pieces together the extraordinary tale of the lost cup and offers a portrait of the modern antiquities trade: a world of tomb raiders, smugglers, wealthy collectors, ambitious archaeologists, rapacious dealers, corrupt curators, and international law enforcement. Spanning twenty-five hundred years, The Lost Chalice moves from the mythic battlefield of the Trojan War to the countryside of twentieth-century Tuscany, the dusty libraries of Oxford University to the exhibition halls of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the cramped law-enforcement offices of the Carabinieri to the tony rooms of New York's auction houses to solve the mystery of the world's rarest masterpiece.</p>
<p>As Silver learns, the discovery of the chalice exposes another riddle—and an even greater missing treasure. Epic and thrilling, <i>The Lost Chalice</i> is a driving true-life detective story that illuminates a big-money, high-stakes, double-dealing world, which is as fascinating as it is unforgettable. Silver's thrilling tale opens a window onto Italian history, culture, and life rarely seen.</p>"

The angelic teenager's homecoming on March 12 captured headlines and magazine covers around the globe, the rare piece of good news in America's era of terror and uncertainty.

Reveal anything — as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.""</p>
<p>It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places — asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously.</p>
<p>The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art — carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them ""graphic haiku,"" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional.</p>
<p>As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project. It has grown into a global phenomenon, exposing our individual aspirations, fantasies, and frailties — our common humanity.</p>

9780060009021,Patrick: The Pilgrim Apostle Of Ireland,['Maire B De Paor'],"<p><b>"". . . whoever is pleased to look at or receive this writing, which Patrick, a sinner, untaught, to be sure, has composed in Ireland . . . this is my Confession before I die.""</b></p>
<p>Who was St Patrick? In the modern era his name still carries the aura of legend — yet the truths of his life remain unknown to most readers. Now, in this new work of biographical reconstruction, Máire B. de Paor brings us as close as possible to the man behind the myth. Through a combination of painstaking research and a close reading of Patrick's two surviving works — the <b>Confessio</b> and the <b>Epistola,</b> their texts included in full in this edition — de Paor reveals a man at once poet and pilgrim, artist and apostle.</p>
<p>The story of St Patrick, known to many as the patron saint of Ireland, is as complex and mythic as the Irish culture he took as his own. Kidnapped at the age of fifteen, Patrick was smuggled to Ireland in a time of Christian upheaval in Europe. On the rocky coasts of his new home, Patrick adopted the life of a shepherd and the words of his Gaelic companions. At night, however, the Irish hills darkened to reveal the pagan gods and monsters so foreign to Patrick's Christian sensibilities. Patrick prayed for release for six years, only to return to evangelize his pagan captors.</p>
<p>Until recently, the modern consensus was that Patrick was a barely literate rustic struggling with a sense of inadequacy in a language he could not master. In her exhaustively researched biography, Máire B. de Paor uncovers the true Patrick as revealed through his two major literary works. Started as a defense against his accusers, Patrick's writings evolved into something more powerful — a manifestation of the spirit that had gripped him. Set against a backdrop of the Catholic fervor of the fifth century, Patrick's words also reflect a fascinating time in religious history. As a religious figure, and as a captured slave, Patrick was the living embodiment of the conflict between the civilized Roman Catholics and the ""dangerous heathen enemies of the Empire.""</p>
<p>A scholar of exceptional depth and insight, de Paor examines Patrick's written legacy with refreshing vigor and passion and discovers an artist of astonishing literary skill and a man of great spiritual depth.</p>"
9780061120275,A Home On The Field: How One Championship Team Inspires Hope For The Revival Of Small Town America,['Paul Cuadros'],"<p><b>A Home on the Field</b> is about faith, loyalty, and trust. It is a parable in the tradition of <b>Stand and Deliver</b> and <b>Hoosiers</b>—a story of one team and their accidental coach who became certain heroes to the whole community.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, Siler City, North Carolina, has been at the front lines of immigration in the interior portion of the United States. Like a number of small Southern towns, workers come from traditional Latino enclaves across the United States, as well as from Latin American countries, to work in what is considered the home of industrial-scale poultry processing. At enormous risk, these people have come with the hope of a better life and a chance to realize their portion of the American Dream.</p>
<p>But it isn't always easy. Assimilation into the South is fraught with struggles, and in no place is this more poignant than in the schools. When Paul Cuadros packed his bags and moved south to study the impact of the burgeoning Latino community, he encountered a culture clash between the long-time residents and the newcomers that eventually boiled over into an anti-immigrant rally featuring former Klansman David Duke.</p>
<p>It became Paul's goal to show the growing numbers of Latino youth that their lives could be more than the cutting line at the poultry plants, that finishing high school and heading to college could be a reality. He needed to find something that the boys could commit to passionately, knowing that devotion to something bigger than them would be the key to helping the boys find where they fit in the world. The answer was soccer.</p>
<p>But Siler City, like so many other small rural communities, was a football town, and long-time residents saw soccer as a foreign sport and yet another accommodation to the newcomers. After an uphill battle, the Jets soccer team at Jordan-Matthews High School was born. Suffering setbacks and heartbreak, the majority Latino team, in only three seasons and against all odds, emerged poised to win the state championship.</p>"

<p>Originally introduced into the region by Jewish settlers from Judea, other Middle Eastern countries, and North Africa, Italian Jewish cuisine was always more than a mere adaptation of Italian dishes to the Jewish dietary laws; it was a brilliant marriage of ancient Jewish dishes and preparation methods to the local ingredients that relied on the imaginative use of fresh herbs, fruit, and vegetables. Fifteen hundred years later, with the influx of Iberian refugees, it was enriched by some Sephardic (from Spain and Portugal) dishes.</p>
<p>Here you'll find recipes for the quintessential Italian Jewish dishes — from Goose ""Ham,"" Spicy Chicken Liver Toasts, and Jewish Caponata to Sabbath Saffron Rice, Purim Ravioli, and Tagliatelle Jewish Style (Noodle Kugel); from Creamed Baccalà, Red Snapper Jewish Style, and Artichokes Jewish Style to Creamed Fennel and Fried Squash Flowers; from Couscous Salad and Sourdough Challah Bread to Haman's Ears, Honey Cake, and Passover Almond Biscotti.</p>
<p>Selected from Edda Servi Machlin's three widely admired books on Italian Jewish cuisine and filled with beautifully rendered memories from her birthplace, this rare collection of more than three hundred recipes is a powerful tribute to a rich cultural heritage and a rare gift to food lovers.

9780060599317,Herding Cats,"['Lott, Trent , 1941-']","<p><b>Mastering the game and weathering the storms — a riveting and candid memoir from one of washington's true insiders</b></p>
<p>For more than thirty years, Trent Lott of Mississippi has been one of the dominant figures in American political life. From the moment he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972, he has been a leader in the conservative movement that has changed the course of the nation. From his years in Congress to his ascent to majority leader of the Senate — and his decision to leave that post in the heat of controversy — <b>Herding Cats</b> is the frank and revealing chronicle of a unique political life.</p>
<p>Lott's story bridges an extraordinary time in American history. As a fraternity leader during the integration of the University of Mississippi, he helped contain the violence that accompanied James Meredith's enrollment as the university's first African American student. As a congressman during Watergate, he mounted a fierce defense of Richard Nixon — until Gerald Ford quietly counseled him to think twice. A passionate advocate of smaller government, Lott describes his painful choice to support Gerald Ford over his challenger Ronald Reagan in the 1976 election — and his delight in helping lead the revolution that followed Reagan's win in 1980.</p>
<p>Yet it was in his dramatic engagements with the Clinton administration that Lott found his greatest victories — and challenges. Working in secret through political adviser Dick Morris, Lott reveals, he persuaded Clinton to accept health insurance and welfare reform laws, along with spending cuts that balanced the national budget. But he was aghast when years of work on a tobacco settlement were scuttled by the White House in 1997 — possibly because of Al Gore's desire to exploit tobacco as a political issue. With surprising candor, Lott portrays his fruitful working partnership with Democratic leader Tom Daschle during the Clinton impeachment, and again in the hours after the attacks of September 11, 2001. And he describes in painful detail his decision to resign as majority leader after his remarks at Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party — a move he made when it became clear that the Bush White House had circled the wagons against him.</p>
<p>Marked by the same straight-talking style and good humor he has shown throughout his career in public service, Trent Lott's <b>Herding Cats</b> is the memoir of a true master of American political life.</p>"

9780060726041,"Out Of Bounds: Inside The Nba's Culture Of Rape, Violence, And Crime",['Jeff Benedict'],"<p><b>Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA's Culture of Rape, Violence, and Crime</b> is a searing indictment of professional basketball players who live in a world where criminal laws and social norms don't exist, a world where they are given license to act above the law.</p>
<p>On the court, they dazzle us with their spectacular physical feats. They generate millions of dollars of revenue for the NBA and their teams. They inspire adulation. But underneath all the glitz, the money, and alley-oops is a seamy underbelly, a rash of lawlessness that is gripping the NBA.</p>
<p>Based on a first-of-its-kind investigation into the criminal histories of 177 NBA players from the 2001–2002 season, Out of Bounds shows that an alarming four out of every ten NBA players have a police record involving a serious crime. They are All-Stars and they are journeymen, involved in crimes ranging from armed robbery to domestic violence to gun possession to rape.</p>
<p><b>Out of Bounds</b> takes a hard look at shocking cases, with graphic accounts of physical and sexual violence and other outrageous conduct by players. In all, more than 250 people are named, including many prominent NBA players. It exposes the environment and culture that encourages such criminal behavior. It also explains the unique challenges these cases pose for law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors. And <b>Out of Bounds</b> takes readers inside the hidden yet critically vital role that lawyers, agents, and fame play in insulating criminally accused players from accountability.</p>
<p>Author Jeff Benedict, an expert on athletes and crime, draws his conclusions from exhaustive research. In addition to his criminal-background checks, the author retrieved documents from law-enforcement agencies, courts, and private attorneys. He conducted more than 400 interviews with police officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, players, agents, victims, witnesses, and coaches. What emerges is a disturbing and appalling picture of men who live above the law.</p>
<p>A seminal and important work, <b>Out of Bounds</b> will forever change how we look at the NBA and its stars' lives of excess and privilege.</p>"

<p>Communicating with our children. Conversing. Connecting. When did it become so difficult? And how do we begin to change it for the better?</p>
<p>This book was designed to help parents answer these important questions, and it is based on two fundamental ideas: The first is that there are no bad children, and no deliberately bad parents — but that sometimes, despite the best of intentions on both sides, there can be bad <b>relationships</b> between parents and children. The second is that, as parents, we must do everything we can to save those relationships, to reach out and really communicate with our children, because it is only through talking to them that we can create an environment for inspiration and change.</p>
<p>In this compelling book, Shmuley Boteach, passionate social commentator and outspoken relationship guru, walks you through the critical conversations, including: <b>cherishing childhood; developing intellectual curiosity; knowing who you are and what you want to become; learning to forgive; realizing the importance of family and tradition; being fearless and courageous</b>. As a father of eight, Rabbi Shmuley speaks from a wealth of experience. He has written a book for parents of children of all ages, from toddlers, who are just beginning to become aware of the world around them, to adolescents, who must learn to navigate all sorts of tricky social and academic pressures.</p>
<p><b>10 Conversations</b> will help you stay connected to your children so that they develop the kind of strong moral character that leads to rich, meaningful lives.</p>"

9780060890056,Playing My Mother's Blues,['Valerie W Wesley'],"<p><i><b>In her triumphant new novel, bestselling author Valerie Wilson Wesley, one of the most respected and acclaimed voices in contemporary African American fiction, poignantly examines the stubborn bonds of family, passion, and a past that insists on repeating itself.</b></i></p>
<p>Dani Carter was seven years old -- her sister, Rose, seventeen -- when their beautiful, impetuous mother, Maria, walked out of their lives, abandoning her husband and family for a love affair that would end tragically mere months later. Over the decades that followed, Dani was able to overcome the persistent pain and feelings of betrayal, eventually wedding a successful man and giving birth to a wonderful son. But love has long been missing from her marriage, propelling her into the arms of another and inspiring troubling thoughts of escape. If it were not for the distress caused by the recent death of her father, she might well have already been gone. The sins of the mother, Dani fears, have been visited upon the daughter.</p>
<p>Dani's sister, Rose, never spoke or speaks of their lost parent. And their iron-willed, driven father -- who channeled his shame and anger into phenomenal business success -- always made it brutally clear that he considered his ex-wife to be evil incarnate. But Dani remembers a sweet, funny, vivacious young woman who did everything with exuberant love and tenderness. And now that she finds herself in a similar heartbreaking situation, Dani can't help but wonder who Maria really was.</p>
<p>It's a puzzle that may soon be completed, after a lifetime of searching for missing pieces. Maria, calling herself Mariah, is about to reenter her daughters' worlds -- at a time of emotional confusion and physical chaos -- bearing secrets and bitter truths ... and, perhaps, long-awaited answers to what could possibly drive a mother to sacrifice what was dearest to her heart.</p>"

9780060199302,Goddess: Inside Madonna,['Barbara Victor'],"<p><i>Goddess</i> is the book that Madonna and her entourage did not want published. Long before the star could instruct her family and friends not to talk to the author, Barbara Victor spent more than eighteen months in Michigan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, California, New York, and Florida, interviewing Madonna's father and stepmother, her grandmother and other family members, as well as friends, neighbors, business associates, and former lovers and colleagues, some of whom knew the Ciccone family from the time Madonna was a young child, many of whom have never before spoken either on or off the record.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary biography, Barbara Victor taps into previously unexplored sources to unmask the privet person behind the public image. As a result of her extensive research, Victor casts new light on every aspect of Madonna's career and private life — from her childhood in Michigan to her early years in New York, from meteoric ascent to stardom to her most recent incarnation as an English wife and mother.</p>
<p>After almost two decades, since she first appeared in the international music scene, Madonna continues to fascinate and challenge both her fans and her detractors. With her remarkable ability to reinvent herself — from diva to provocateur, from artist to mogul — she continues to command more attention and arouse more controversy than any other public figure of our time. Alternately criticized and revered, Madonna consistently and dramatically sets style, social, sexual, and musical trends and yet she remains an enigma to her public, keeping her most intimate identity hidden from all but her closest friends.<i>Goddess</i> offers explosive newrevelations about Madonna's life, her career, and the fact or fantasy of her lesbian and heterosexual relationships.

<p>Privately printed in 1931, <i>Joy</i> has always been family affair, and like a family it has grown. Written by Irma Starkloff Rombauer, a St. Louisan, it was first tested and illustrated by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and subsequently it was revised and enlarged through Marion's efforts and those of her architect husband, John W. Becker. Their sons — Ethan, with his Cordon Bleu and camping experiences, and Mark, with his interest in natural foods-have reinforced <i>Joy</i> in many ways.</p>
<p>Now over forty, <i>Joy</i> continues to be a family affair, demonstrating more than ever the awareness we all share in the growing preciousness of food. Special features in this edition are the chapter on <i>Heat,</i> which gives you many hints on maintaining the nutrients in the food you are cooking, and <i>Know Your Ingredients,</i> which reveals vital characteristics of the materials you commonly combine, telling how and why they react as they do; how to measure them; when feasible, how to substitute one for another; as well as amounts to buy. Wherever possible, information also appears at the point of use.</p>
<p>Divided into three parts, <i>Foods We Eat, Foods We Heat</i> and <i>Foods We Keep,</i> <i>Joy</i> now contains more than 4500 recipes, many hundreds of them new to this edition — the first full revision in twelve years. All the enduring favorites will still be found. In the chapter on <i>Brunch, Lunch and Supper Dishes</i> there are also interesting suggestions for using convenience and leftover foods. Through its more than 1000 practical, delightful drawings by Ginnie Hofmann and Ikki Matsumoto, <i>Joy</i> shows how to present food correctly and charmingly, from the simplest to the most formal service; how to prepare ingredients with classic tools and techniques; and how to preserve safely the results of your canning and freezing.</p>
<p><i>Joy</i> grows with the times; it has a full roster of American and foreign dishes: Strudel, Zabaglione, Rijsttafel, Couscous, among many others. All the classic terms you find on menus, such as Provencale, bonne femme, meunière and Florentine, are not merely defined but fully explained so you yourself can confect the dish they characterize. Throughout the book the whys and wherefores of the directions are given, with special emphasis on that vital cooking factor — heat. Did you know that even the temperature of an ingredient can make or mar your best-laid plans? Learn exactly what the results of <i>simmering, blanching, roasting</i> and <i>braising</i> have on your efforts. Read the enlarged discussion on herbs, spices and seasonings, and note that their use is included in suitable amounts in the recipes. No detail necessary to your success in cooking has been omitted.</p>
<p><i>Joy</i>, we hope, will always remain essentially a family affair, as well as an enterprise in which its authors owe no obligation to anyone but to themselves and to you. Choose from our offerings what suits your person, your way of life, your pleasure — and join us in the <i>Joy</i> of cooking.</p>
<p> Because of the infinite patience that has gone into the preparation of <i>Joy of Cooking,</i> the publishers offer it on a money-back guarantee. Without question there is no finer all-purpose cookbook.</p>


                        <p>The newly revised and expanded edition of this American household classic includes more ethnic recipes while stressing healthier, lower-fat cooking.

9780061731167,Judgment Call: A Brady Novel Of Suspense (joanna Brady Mysteries),['J. A Jance'],"<p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author J. A. Jance brings back acclaimed sheriff Joanna Brady in an exciting and twisting mystery set against the beauty and isolation of the Arizona desert</p>
<p class=""null1"">Judgment Call</p>
<p>When Joanna Brady's daughter, Jenny, stumbles across the body of her high school principal, Debra Highsmith, in the desert, the Cochise County sheriff's personal and professional worlds collide, forcing her to tread the difficult middle ground between being an officer of the law and a mother. While investigating murders has always meant discovering unpleasant facts and disquieting truths, the experienced Joanna isn't prepared for the knowledge she's about to uncover. Though she's tried to protect her children from the dangers of the grown-up world, the search for justice leads straight to her own door and forces her to face the possibility that her beloved daughter may be less perfect than she seems—especially when a photo from the crime scene ends up on Facebook. A photo only one person close to the crime scene could have taken.</p>
<p>The gruesome picture is just the tip of the iceberg. Even a small, close-knit town like Bisbee has its secrets. Navigating her way through the unfamiliar world of social media, Joanna discovers shocking—and incriminating—information. The details build, from a hushed-up suspension, to a group of teenagers with a grudge against the late Ms. Highsmith, to a hateful video calling for the principal's death. The video evidence points to one particular privileged boy, who's already lawyered up thanks to his father, a well-to-do doctor determined to protect his son's reputation. Yet the deeper Joanna digs, the more complications she uncovers. It seems the quiet, upstanding principal had a hidden past, full of mysterious secrets she'd successfully kept buried for years.</p>

9780061368134,"The Addict: One Patient, One Doctor, One Year",['Michael Stein'],"<p><i>The Addict</i> opens a window on the very private world of prescription drug addiction, revealing the harrowing and riveting story of a young woman whose life has been taken over by an impulse that she can't control and a need that she can't extinguish.</p>
<p>Lucy's first appointment with Dr. Michael Stein was on a sunny day in April, and the minute she sat down she said, ""I'm here for your program,"" beginning a series of intimate encounters during the course of a year that took her back to the origins of her addiction and unraveled a life driven by compulsion and the constant pursuit of the next pill. <i>The Addict</i> follows Lucy from the start of her treatment, through relapse, to her eventual long-term recovery, including her breakup with a destructive boyfriend whose own addiction to drugs surpassed hers. This is an unforgettable tale of a young woman living on the edge but determined to take control of her life.</p>
<p>Here also is the deeply personal account of a doctor on the front lines of an epidemic. In this masterful work, Michael Stein brings in other patients whose experiences are like Lucy's but in many ways are completely different. Dr. Stein explains what doctors are thinking and feeling about addiction, and how they make difficult decisions with difficult patients. He also aims to change the way we think about addiction, arguing that it should be treated as we treat diabetes or high blood pressure—as a disease within the medical system.</p>
<p>This affecting and thought-provoking book will resonate with anyone struggling with chemical dependence. In <i>The Addict</i>, Dr. Stein creates a portrait of the intimate bond between one patient and onedoctor, a relationship that is profoundly moving and incredibly compelling.</p>"

9780060737962,"Water From The Well: Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, And Leah",['Anne Roiphe'],"<p><i>Water from the Well</i> is a journey four thousand years back to the time of Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah. These biblical matriarchs and their fascinating stories come alive in the hands of renowned author Anne Roiphe, whose graceful prose captures the biblical landscape and makes it take flight.</p>
<p>As each story unfolds, we find that the matriarchs had to overcome the same devastating obstacles women face today, such as infertility, lust, abandonment, and uncertainty. Roiphe demonstrates how the lives of Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah helped to lay the foundation of womanhood in the Western world. Though these women lived many years ago, their lives bear a striking resemblance to our own. They suffered the same pressures and pitfalls, enjoyed the same pleasures and activities, and shared the same responsibilities as today's wives, mothers, and daughters. What is more, they managed to cope with betrayal, death, sacrifice, and jealousy while dealing with the emerging reality of a new faith period.</p>
<p>Little of the drama in the Bible is seen from a woman's perspective. Would Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah share the same point of view as contemporary women? With life having changed so drastically from the days of the Bible, what can we really <i>know</i> about the women who appear in one of our most sacred text? In <i>Water from the Well</i> these questions and many others are addressed in a most enriching fashion, allowing us to discover that women played larger roles in biblical history than many care to acknowledge.</p>
<p>Roiphe opens a window onto the distant past and presents it, through the tales of four remarkable women, to the modern reader withrelevant observations and allegories. Combining the deep insight of Bruce Feiler with the narrative skill of Antonia Fraser, Roiphe delivers a fascinating work that deftly brings these four biblical matriarchs into our own age.</p>"

 <i>""No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.""</i></p>
<p>Amber Frey's life was full of blessings: an exciting new business, a beautiful home, and most of all, her infant daughter, Ayiana. But Amber had been through some unhappy relationships, and she longed for a true and loving partner. In November 2002, she went on a blind date with Scott Peterson. He was handsome, charming, thoughtful, and romantic. Best of all, he was single and ready to settle down . . . or so he said.</p>
<p>Their connection was immediate. Over the next few weeks, Amber and Scott grew closer and closer. Scott won her over with his warmth, humor, and intelligence, and he even won the heart of little Ayiana. Before long, he began to speak of the beautiful future the three of them were destined to share as a family.</p>
<p>Soon enough, however, Amber began to suspect that Scott Peterson might not be the man he claimed to be. On December 9, he broke down in tears and told her that he had been married, but had ""lost"" his wife. This was weeks before Laci Peterson, eight months pregnant at the time, was even reported missing. Scott Peterson hadn't lost her, but clearly he was planning to.</p>
<p>Suddenly a relationship that seemed full of promise was turning into Amber's worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Amber launched an investigation of her own. The moment she was able to confirm her worst suspicions, she contacted the Modesto Police Department, in northern California, and offered to do whatever she could to help. She begansecretly taping her conversations with Scott, pressing him for information but never letting on that she had heard the news of Laci's disappearance. Those conversations became the basis for the prosecution's case against Scott Peterson for the murder of his wife and unborn child.</p>
<p>Amber's whole world was turned upside down in the process. She lost her privacy, as every detail of her life was scrutinized by the media, who couldn't seem to get enough of this tragic, heart-wrenching story. But she soldiered on, looking deep inside herself and drawing strength from her faith.</p>
<p><i>Witness</i> is the chilling story of how a young woman became ensnared in Scott Peterson's web of lies, then risked everything to seek justice for Laci Peterson and her unborn child, Conner. It is also a story of forgiveness and faith, and of one woman's struggle to live with an open and honest heart.</p>"

<p><b>My First New York</b> features candid accounts of coming to New York by more than fifty of the most remarkable people who have called the city home. Here are true stories of long nights out and wild nights in, of first dates and lost loves, of memorable meals and miserable jobs, of slow walks up Broadway and fast subway rides downtown.</p>
<p>The contributors—a mix of actors, artists, comedians, entrepreneurs, musicians, politicians, sports stars, writers, and others—reflect an enormous variety of experiences: few have arrived with less than filmmaker Jonas Mekas, a concentration-camp survivor on a UN refugee ship; few have swanned in with more than designer Diane von Furstenberg, a <b>princess</b>. And an extraordinary number managed to land in New York just as something historic was happening—the artist Cindy Sherman arrived in the middle of the Summer of Sam; restaurateur Danny Meyer came on the day John Lennon was shot.</p>
<p>Arranged chronologically, these moving and memorable stories combine to form an impressionistic history of New York since the Great Depression. They also provide an accidental encyclopedia of New York hotspots through the ages: from the Cedar Tavern and the Gaslight to Lutèce and Elaine's, from Max's Kansas City and the Mudd Club to the Odeon and Bungalow 8, they're all here, dots on the unbroken line of the Next Next things.</p>
<p>Taken together, <b>My First New York</b> is a collection of fifty-six testaments to a larger revelation, one that new arrivals of all stripes and all eras have experienced again and again in New York, regardless of how the city proceeds to treat them: what the songwriter Rufus Wain-wright calls ""having cracked the code of living life to the fullest.""</p>

9780061373480,"Getting Into Guinness: One Man's Longest, Fastest, Highest Journey Inside The World's Most Famous Record Book",['Larry Olmsted'],"<p>A fascinating mix of participatory journalism and history, <b>Getting Into Guinness</b> is the never-before-told story of the bestselling copyrighted book of all time. Veteran reporter Larry Olmsted began a personal quest to break an existing world record, then to set another one, and soon he was fully immersed in the crazy and highly competitive world of record breaking. This is his behind-the-scenes report of the characters who created the famous record book and continue to make it wackier and wackier with every passing year.</p>
<p>The enthralling 50-year history of the Guinness World Records is a story of phenomenal success, equally compelling failures, and extreme oddities. People all over the world strive to get into the book, often in the most unbelievable ways. Olmsted chronicles some of the funniest and most interesting Guinness record holders from a uniquely insider perspective: he himself is one of them.</p>
<p>It all began with a gentleman's wager over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the grouse. The attempt to answer this question has sold more than 100 million books in dozens of languages and every corner of the globe. Today, there is heated competition for the record to hold the most records (currently held by Ashrita Furman, 114 records and counting), as well as classic curiosities that have lasted for decades (the tallest man in history is still Robert Wadlow, at 8' 11""). Interwoven into all of this is Olmsted's account of his own two successful record-setting attempts, the first involving traveling halfway around the world with his golf shoes—""Greatest Distance Between Two Rounds of Golf on the Same Day""—and the second causing him to nearly lose his mind while playing the world's longest poker session.</p>
<p>Why do people devote so much energy to get into the record book, often at great risk? Why do the most extreme fans devote their entire lives to this pursuit? Why is society so obsessed with records and record breaking? Why do Americans alone buy a million and a half copies of the famous book every year, propelling it to the top of the bestseller lists decade after decade? Why do readers of all generations remember the same record-holding icons, the fattest twins, the longest fingernails, and the tallest man? After his own journey inside the world of record breaking, these are the questions Olmsted attempts to answer.</p>
<p>In the tradition of the bestselling <b>Word Freak</b>—a mélange of travelogue, memoir, investigative journalism, and history—<b>Getting Into Guinness</b> is a must-read for anyone who has ever read <b>Guinness World Records</b> and wondered why someone would grow their fingernails for an entire lifetime.</p>"

<p>In <b>Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora</b> we are introduced to Pandora—a pristine and beautiful moon in a distant solar system—its exotic ecosystems, and the indigenous race called the Na'vi. By piecing together photographs, scientific field notes, and research data, citizens on Earth have collected the information in this field guide as a way to highlight the lessons Pandora can teach the people of Earth, who have struggled to survive as their planet's critical resources are depleted.</p>

9780060194376,Murder In Spokane: Catching A Serial Killer,['Mark Fuhrman'],"<p>A gripping investigation of a serial killer's spree by the author of the <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers <b>Murder in Brentwood</b> and <b>Murder in Greenwich.</b></p>
<p>On August 26, 1997, the bodies of Jennifer Joseph and Heather Hernandez were found dumped in separate places in Spokane, Washington. In the following months, another eight bodies were discovered, all of them those of drug addicts and prostitutes who had worked Spokane's red-light district.</p>
<p>The police wouldn't even use the term ""serial killer."" The local media and town leaders also stayed quiet. As long as the victims came from the wrong side of town, ""respectable"" Spokane didn't seem too worried that a brutal psychopath was in their midst and that as many as eighteen women were dead by his hand.</p>
<p>Enter Mark Fuhrman.</p>
<p>A brilliant investigator, Fuhrman helped authorities bring charges against a well-connected suspect when his bestselling book <b>Murder in Greenwich</b> spawned a Connecticut grand jury investigation of the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley. After moving to Idaho, he began appearing as a guest host on a Spokane radio talk show and quickly found himself at the center of another high-profile murder case.</p>
<p>Written in the same fast-paced style as <b>Murder in Brentwood</b> and <b>Murder in Greenwich,</b> this is a shocking account of Fuhrman's investigation of the prostitutes' deaths as he worked alongside the Spokane Task Force.</p>
<p>The serial killer preyed on prostitutes with drug problems. He intentionally selected street people, who would not be missed right away, often women who were new to town. The police seemingly put these murders on the back burner because the victims did not stir up public sentiment. Only after the serial killer began to play with the police — planting bodies for attention and escalating the murders — did intense effort go into the case.</p>
<p>Though the understaffed police force did catch the killer, Fuhrman shows that their reliance on computers and on DNA test results from everyone they interviewed was slower than doing old-fashioned gumshoe detective work. With the clues they had, Fuhrman writes, the police could have made the arrest two years earlier — saving the lives of at least nine women.</p>
<p>With the expertise of a seasoned investigator and an exceptional writer, Fuhrman takes you inside the mind of a detective pursuing the most dangerous criminal on the streetsa serial killer.</p>"

<p>The creation of the United States of America is the central event of the past four hundred years,"" states Walter McDougall in his preface to <b>Freedom Just Around the Corner</b>. With this statement begins McDougall's most ambitious, original, and uncompromising of histories. McDougall marshals the latest scholarship and writes in a style redolent with passion, pathos, and humour in pursuit of truths often obscured in books burdened with political slants.</p>
<p>With an insightful approach to the nearly 250 years spanning America's beginnings, McDougall offers his readers an understanding of the uniqueness of the ""American character"" and how this character has shaped the wide ranging course of historical events. McDougall explains that Americans have always been in a unique position of enjoying ""more opportunity to pursue their ambitions—an any other people in history."" Throughout <b>Freedom Just Around the Corner</b> the character of the American people shines, a character built out of a freedom to indulge in the whole panoply of human behaviour. The genius behind the success of the United States is founded on the complex, irrepressible American spirit.</p>
<p>A grand narrative rich with new details and insights about colonial and early national history, <b>Freedom Just Around the Corner</b> is the first instalment of a trilogy that will eventually bring the story of America up to the present day, a story epic, bemusing, and brooding.</p>"

9780060736699,Rewriting History,['Dick Morris'],"<p>A smart and scathing bestseller: former Clinton adviser and confidant Dick Morris offers a response to Hillary Clinton's biography - to expose the history of lies and obfuscations this very controversial politician has left in her wake...</p>
<p>In Rewriting History, Dick Morris had his biggest bestseller in years--and with its subject, Hillary Clinton, perennially in the spotlight, this smart and scathing rebuttal to Living History is sure to have a robust life in paperback as well.</p>
<p>A long-time adviser to both Clintons, in Rewriting History Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hilary, the former first lady, current New York Senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008-and none would bring more baggage to the White house-than Mrs. Clinton. Drawing on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, non-partisan analysis, Morris pierces Hillary's mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of her memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the ""advice addict"" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Morris argues, Hillary Clinton faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process? As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that her past performance is no guarantee of future results.</p>
<p>o For political buffs.</p>
<p>o Dick Morris's credibility as an insider-from his years of experience as an advisor to politicians of every stripe, to his own extensive interactions with the Clintons in the years leading up to and during Clinton's presidency-makes Morris's book the most qualified analysis of, and answer to, Senator Clinton's bestselling memoir.</p>"

Symptoms include thinning hair, persistent acne, mood swings, low energy, loss of pleasure in sex, weight gain, irregular periods, and pain. While the media has emphasized the problems of menopause, Dr. Redmond explains that all too many women experience hormonal miseries even in their thirties. Lab tests are often normal because the problem is not the hormones themselves but how a woman's body reacts to them. Healthy, active women suddenly find that once quiescent hormones have taken over control of their lives. Because their problems are often dismissed as trivial, women who are hormonally vulnerable are frequently thwarted in their quest for help. Too often they are brushed off with remarks such as, ""Your tests are normal; there's nothing wrong with you."" This is tragic because, as Dr. Redmond demonstrates, hormonal balance can nearly always be restored with the treatments he details, which include individualized use of prescription medications, herbal supplements, lifestyle changes, and even spiritual practices. Many women have heard that testosterone can help sex drive, but most have not been warned about the damage that careless testosterone therapy can cause on skin and hair.</p>
<p>In this book, Dr. Redmond, an internationally recognized authority on testosterone in women, explains the only safe ways to use testosterone. With informative sidebars, quizzes, and personal stories of women who have overcome hormone vulnerability, this helpful book will empower you to find treatments for your hormone problems that are tailored to fit your own body, biochemistry, symptoms, and lifestyle.</p>"

9780060786281,Catherine The Great,['Simon Dixon'],"<p>Admired for her achievements and satirized for her personal life, Catherine the Great was one of the most celebrated monarchs in history, turning eighteenth-century Russia into arguably the largest and most powerful state since the fall of the Roman Empire. She promoted radical political ideas while emphasizing moderation in government. She could be ruthless when necessary, but she charmed everyone she met, joking at private dinner parties in the Hermitage, which she had built for her own use. Determined to endear herself to the Russians, she made religious devotions in which she never believed.</p>
<p>Intimate and revealing, <b>Catherine the Great</b> examines the lifelong friendships that sustained the empress throughout her personal life and places her within the context of the royal court: its politics, its flourishing literature and the very culture that became central to her exercise of absolute power.</p>"

An extreme landscape in both its beauty and challenges, the state is nicknamed ""The Last Frontier"" with good reason: Here is a paradoxical landscape where boundaries—between community and isolation, bounty and deprivation, conservation and exploitation—are constantly in flux.</p>
<p>But the state has also always been a place for reinvention, a refuge as much for those desperate to escape something as for those on a quest for something else. In <b>Tide, Feather, Snow</b>, Miranda Weiss, a young woman who grew up landlocked in well-kept East Coast suburbs, moves with her boyfriend to Homer, Alaska, where the days are quartered by the most extreme tides in the country, where the years are marked by seasons of fish, and where locals carry around the knowledge of fish, tides, boats, and weather as ballast. At first, she struggles to make a place for herself in this unfamiliar country. But ultimately, Weiss learns the skills to survive on her own, from setting a fishing net to befriending the locals, from jarring rosehip butter to skinning a sea otter.</p>
<p>Weiss's keenly observed prose introduces readers to the memorable people and peculiar beauty of Alaska's vast landscape and takes us on her personal journey of adventure, physical challenge, and culture clash. In the tradition of John McPhee's <b>Coming into the Country</b>, this elegant and affecting memoir is nature writing at its best.</p>"

9780060795115,Cover Up: What The Government Is Still Hiding About The War On Terror,['Peter Lance'],"<p>Alongside the bestselling 9/11 Commission Report is investigative journalist Peter Lance's expose of the government's decade long cover-up about al Qaeda, and how they're still hiding the truth today.</p>
<p>In the groundbreaking 1000 Years for Revenge, Peter Lance exposed the FBI's twelve-year record of negligence that led to the attacks of 9/11. Now, alongside the bestselling 9/11 Commission Report, Lance's Cover Up, proves that the government has been covering up its own counter-terror failures since the mid-1990s and continues to do so today.</p>
<p>Part I presents new major revelations about Ramzi Yousef, bin Laden's master bomber, and a plan to use his fellow prisoner, the convicted Mafioso Greg Scarpa Jr., to mine Yousef for information. In 1996, while Yousef was awaiting trial, the terrorist told Scarpa in detail how al Qaeda was planning to blow up an airliner in order to secure a mistrial. Yousef was even given access to an outside phone line so that the Feds could monitor his calls. But the plan backfired: Yousef reached his cohorts and TWA 800 was blown out of the sky. Yet the critical Scarpa intel was ultimately disregarded; if Scarpa were presented as a credible witness, it would have undermined a series of cases in which Scarpa had been rejected to protect a crooked FBI agent. The Feds threw away an opportunity to stop the biggest terror strike in the US before 9/11.</p>
<p>Part II reveals the government's continued cover up efforts, penetrating even the 9/11 Commission. Lance-who testified in private before the Commission-offers a minority report on the proceedings, revealing the many conflicts of interest among the commissioners and their personal motives for covering evidence and ignoring major parts of the story. Raising scores of unanswered questions, Cover Up proves one thing beyond a doubt: When it comes to understanding 9/11 we are as far from the truth as ever.</p>"

On the surface, the two women could not have been more different. The daughter of sharecroppers, Gibson was born in the American South and grew up in Harlem.

But both women encountered prejudice, particularly on the tennis circuit, where they were excluded from tournaments and clubs because of race and religion.</p>

9780061560941,"The Last Of His Kind: The Life And Adventures Of Bradford Washburn, America's Boldest Mountaineer",['David Roberts'],"<p>American Brad Washburn had an impact on his protégés and imitators as profound as that of any other adventurer in the twentieth century. Unquestionably regarded as the greatest mountaineer in Alaskan history and as one of the finest mountain photographers of all time, Washburn transformed American attitudes toward wilderness and revolutionized the art of mountaineering and exploration in the great ranges. In <i>The Last of His Kind, National Geographic Adventure</i> contributing editor David Roberts goes beyond conventional biography to reveal the essence of this man through the prism of his extraordinary exploits from New England to Chamonix, the Himalaya to the Yukon.</p>
<p>Washburn's remarkable achievements—including nine first ascents of North American peaks—would stamp him not only as one of a kind, but as one of a kind they don't make anymore. Born June 7, 1910, to a Boston Brahmin family whose roots trace back to the Mayflower, this highly intelligent, impatient, and stubborn iconoclast published books, made a monumental first ascent in the French Alps that would become a touchstone in mountaineering history, and lectured on his adventures—including an address to the National Geographic Society—while still in his teens. In 1935, at the age of twenty-four, while others were turning their attention to the Himalaya, the Harvard-educated Washburn led a three-month journey across what was then the largest remaining unexplored territory in North America—the 6,400 square miles of glaciers and mountains in the frozen heart of Alaska's Saint Elias Range.</p>
<p>In addition to his prowess as a mountaineer and photographer, Washburn was also a renowned surveyor and cartographer, producing maps of little-known terrain—the Grand Canyon, Mt. McKinley, and Mt. Everest—that surpassed those that came before, and several of which remain the standard. He was also a scientist who would take a regional natural-history museum and transform it into one of the outstanding teaching institutions of its kind in the world.</p>

Schwartz', 'Beverly Beyette']","<p>An estimated 5 million Americans suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and live diminished lives in which they are compelled to obsess about something or to repeat a similar task over and over. Traditionally, OCD has been treated with Prozac or similar drugs. The problem with medication, aside from its cost, is that 30 percent of people treated don't respond to it, and when the pills stop, the symptoms invariably return.</p>
<p>In <b>Brain Lock,</b> Jeffrey M. Schwartz presents a simple four-step method for overcoming OCD that is so effective, it's now used in academic treatment centers throughout the world. Proven by brain-imaging tests to actually alter the brain's chemistry, this method doesn't rely on psychopharmaceuticals. Instead, patients use cognitive self-therapy and behavior modification to develop new patterns of response to their obsessions. In essence, they use the mind to fix the brain. Using the real-life stories of actual patients, <b>Brain Lock</b> explains this revolutionary method and provides readers with the inspiration and tools to free themselves from their psychic prisons and regain control of their lives.</p>"

<p>Born in El Paso's Segundo Barrio, or Second Ward, pioneering basketball coach Nolan Richardson grew up in the only black family in a Mexican neighborhood and attended desegregated Bowie High School in 1955. Richardson went on to play at Texas Western College, now the University of Texas at El Paso, as the first black star player for legendary coach Don Haskins. Richardson eventually rose to national prominence as a coach in his own right. He became the first black coach at a predominately white school in the Old South to win the NCAA Championship in 1994 at the University of Arkansas. With Richardson's Razorbacks playing at a high-pressure, electrifying pace—a style he called ""Forty Minutes of Hell,"" which became a nationally known trademark—Arkansas made three appearances in the Final Four, and Richardson was named NABC Coach of the Year in 1994.</p>
<p>Richardson's gradual political awakening, and his subsequent refusal to keep quiet about overt or subtle racial injustices, marked his rise. Regardless of his staggering win totals, tensions in Arkansas culminated in an infamous 2002 press conference in which he accused the University of Arkansas of discriminating against him, bringing about an abrupt end to his college coaching career. The only coach in history to win a Junior College National Championship, the NIT, and the NCAA tournament, Richardson went on to coach internationally and in the WNBA.</p>
<p>Rus Bradburd, a former college basketball coach who also worked with Don Haskins, highlights Richardson's trailblazing career with empathy and intimacy, revealing a man whose hard-won successes were matched by deeply felt losses. An intensive inside look at elite collegiate athletics and a chronicle of the transition away from the segregated era of American sport, <i>Forty Minutes of Hell</i> is the first full-length biography of Nolan Richardson, setting his complicated story against the backdrop of a decisive time in American history.</p>"

9780060610357,The God We Never Knew: Beyond Dogmatic Religion To A More Authenthic Contemporary Faith,"['Borg', 'Marcus J.']","<p>Answering the many ""spiritual"" questions left unaddressed by such popular historical bestsellers as <b>A History of God</b> and <b>God: A Biography</b>, renowned author Marcus Borg reveals how to embrace an authentic contemporary faith that reconciles God with science, critical thinking and religious pluralism.</p>
<p>How to have faith––how to even think about God––without having to stifle modern rationality is one of the most vital challenges facing contemporary religion. In providing a much–needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet fully contemporary understanding of God, Borg––author of the bestselling <b>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</b>––traces his personal journey. He leads readers from the all–powerful and authoritarian God of his (and their) childhood and traditional faith to an equally powerful but dynamic image of God that is relevant to contemporary seekers and more biblical and spiritually authentic. Borg shows how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in delusion––misinterpretation of biblical texts and of God's true nature––and challenges readers to a new way of thinking about God. He opens a practical discussion about how to base a relationship with the divine both immanent and transcendant, here and now, always and everywhere.</p>
<p>Arguing that the authentic Judeo–Christian tradition is that God's being includes the whole world, Borg persuasively shows how this understanding accounts for the whole variety of human religious experience. Ultimately, he introduces readers to a way of thinking about God who is ""right here"" all around them, rather than distant and remote. This understanding is more intellectually and spiritually satisfying and allows readers to reclaim a stronger sense of God's presence.</p>"

9780060394370,Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters In Life I Learned From Horses,['Bo Derek'],"<p>Bo Derek vaulted into the national spotlight in 1979 as the perfect fantasy woman in <b>10,</b> Blake Edwards's sophisticated film comedy. Her otherworldly beauty and voluptuous figure captivated men everywhere, while her cornrow hairstyle launched a fashion trend among women. Bo has always remained intensely private about her personal life, especially with regards to her May-December marriage to director John Derek, creating an intriguing sense of mystery that has led to much speculation. Here, for the first time, she reveals the truth about the woman behind the glossy image.</p>
<p>Born Mary Cathleen Collins and known as Cathy, she grew up in southern California, the horse-crazy oldest daughter of four. Her father, a public relations executive for the boat manufacturer Hobie Cat, and her mother, a hairstylist and makeup artist for a number of Hollywood figures, separated permanently while Bo was in her teens. During this time her mother was working for Ann-Margret, and it was backstage at one of the entertainer's Las Vegas shows that a theatrical agent approached Bo about pursuing a movie career. At one of her very first auditions the sixteen-year-old Bo met John Derek, a man thirty years her senior, with whom she would spend the next twenty-five years of her life.</p>
<p>Theirs was a love affair of epic proportions, but it was one that was widely misunderstood by the press and public alike. John was dubbed a Svengali, and his influence over the young Bo was thought to be limitless. With great candor and an endearing humor, Bo comes clean on a relationship that has long intrigued provided fodder for American gossip mills, and the result is an account that is far from what we may haveimagined. Bo lays bare the intimate moments and madcap adventures that she and John shared, revealing in the process that she has never, even for a moment, relinquished control of her own destiny.</p>
<p>Given her unusual story, her only-in-Hollywood childhood, her friendships with Ursula Andress and Linda Evans (both of John's ex-wives), her time spent living in a trailer home, her rumored relationship with Ted Turner, and her exhaustive work for the Republican Party, it often seems as if Bo has lived nine lives rather than just one. Whether spurning <b>Life</b> magazine or passing on the opportunity to work with legendary filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis, Bo has gone with her gut regardless of the consequences. And that's only fitting for the woman who has chosen to live life with no safety nets—and no regrets.</p>
<p>But as Bo makes clear in <b>Riding Lessons,</b> it is her passion for John and her love of all things equine that have been the constants in her life. Sharing her hard-won lessons on life and love, she draws on her intuitive understanding of horses to offer surprising insights into the dynamics of intimate relationships.</p>
<p>In this compelling memoir, Bo Derek writes openly of her growing self-awareness and of the coping strategies she has learned, whether faced with sudden stardom, the crazy and competitive world of moviemaking, or the death of her beloved husband. With <b>Riding Lessons,</b> she transcends her legendary physical beauty to reveal an inner wisdom certain to enlighten and enthrall readers of all ages.</p>"

Filled with the thrilling never-before-told personal stories of the prisoners of war held within it's walls — who made it their personal duty and obsession to escape — <b>Colditz</b> offers endlessly intriguing stories of consummate survivors who proved the human spirit to be indomitable.</p>
<p>During World War II Colditz, a medieval fortress, served as the only high-security camp in Germany. Its massive walls contained every persistent escapee, troublemaker, and valuable hostage captured by the Germans. Guards and prisoners were almost equal in number, and Colditz — which boasted such prison-break deterrents as walls up to twelve feet thick, battlements of solid rock, and a 150-foot drop from the castle to the valley below — was considered escape proof. But the prisoners — many of whom were high-ranking military officers — were determined to accomplish the impossible and pooled their collective talents to create the greatest escape academy of the war. Three hundred officers attempted to escape and thirty achieved what they considered to be the <b>home run,</b> journeying all the way back to their native country.</p>
<p>In <b>Colditz,</b> Henry Chancellor breaks new ground by offering the prisoners' own stories of the great escapes. Using more than fifty original interviews, the English, French, Dutch, and Polish officers and their guards describe in their own words their experiences in the notorious castle. They reveal their boredom and frustrations, as well as the challenges inherent in making maps out of jelly or constructing tunnels with mere cutlery knives. The stories are by turns comic and tragic as much of their labor and invention ended in failure, but what emerges is a story of breathtaking ingenuity and daring, and an intriguing portrait of the fascinating game of wits between captives and captors, who were bound together by mutual respect and extraordinary tolerance.</p>"

9780060874490,The Forgery Of Venus,"['Gruber, Michael , 1940-']","<p>Chaz Wilmot is a painter born outside his time. He possesses a virtuosic command of the techniques of the old masters. He can paint like Leonardo, Goya, Gainsborough—artists whose works sell for millions—but this style of painting is no longer popular, and he refuses to shape his talent to fit the fashion of the day. So Wilmot makes his living cranking out parodies for ads and magazine covers. A break comes when an art dealer obtains for him a commission to restore a Venetian palace fresco by the eighteenth-century master Tiepolo, for a disreputable Italian businessman. Once there, Wilmot discovers that it is not a restoration but a re-creation, indeed a forgery. At first skeptical of the job, he then throws himself into the creative challenge and does the job brilliantly. No one can tell the modern work from something done more than two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>This feat attracts the attention of Werner Krebs, an art dealer with a dark past and shadier present who becomes Wilmot's friend and patron. Wilmot is suddenly working with a fervor he hasn't felt in years, but his burst of creative activity is accompanied by strange interludes: Without warning, he finds himself reliving moments from his past—not as memories but as if they are happening all over again. Soon, it is no longer his own past he's revisiting; he believes he can travel back to the seventeenth century, where he lived as the Spanish artist Diego Rodríguez de Silva Velázquez, one of the most famous painters in history. Wilmot begins to fantasize that as Velázquez, he has created a masterpiece, a stunning portrait of a nude. When the painting actually turns up, he doesn't know if he painted it or if he imagined the whole thing.</p>
<p>Little by little, Wilmot enters a mirror house of illusions and hallucinations that propels him into a secret world of gangsters, greed, and murder, with his mystery patron at the center of it all, either as the mastermind behind a plot to forge a painting worth hundreds of millions, or as the man who will save Wilmot from obscurity and madness.</p>
<p>In Chaz Wilmot, we meet the rarest breed of literary hero, one for whom the reader feels almost personally responsible. By turns brutally honest and self-deceptive, scornful of the world while yearning to make his mark on it, Wilmot comes astonishingly alive for the reader, and his perilous journey toward the truth becomes our own.</p>
<p>The Forgery of Venus, a blend of erudition, unflagging narrative brio, and emotional depth, brings us inexorably toward the intersection where genius and insanity collide. Miraculously inventive, this book cements Gruber's reputation as one of the most imaginative and gifted writers of our time.</p>"

9780060598990,"The Myth Of The Rational Market: A History Of Risk, Reward, And Delusion On Wall Street",['Justin Fox'],"<p>Chronicling the rise and fall of the efficient market theory and the century-long making of the modern financial industry, Justin Fox's <b>The Myth of the Rational Market</b> is as much an intellectual whodunit as a cultural history of the perils and possibilities of risk. The book brings to life the people and ideas that forged modern finance and investing, from the formative days of Wall Street through the Great Depression and into the financial calamity of today. It's a tale that features professors who made and lost fortunes, battled fiercely over ideas, beat the house in blackjack, wrote bestselling books, and played major roles on the world stage. It's also a tale of Wall Street's evolution, the power of the market to generate wealth and wreak havoc, and free market capitalism's war with itself.</p>
<p>The efficient market hypothesis—long part of academic folklore but codified in the 1960s at the University of Chicago—has evolved into a powerful myth. It has been the maker and loser of fortunes, the driver of trillions of dollars, the inspiration for index funds and vast new derivatives markets, and the guidepost for thousands of careers. The theory holds that the market is always right, and that the decisions of millions of rational investors, all acting on information to outsmart one another, always provide the best judge of a stock's value. That myth is crumbling.</p>
<p>Celebrated journalist and columnist Fox introduces a new wave of economists and scholars who no longer teach that investors are rational or that the markets are always right. Many of them now agree with Yale professor Robert Shiller that the efficient markets theory “represents one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought.” Today the theory has given way to counterintuitive hypotheses about human behavior, psychological models of decision making, and the irrationality of the markets. Investors overreact, underreact, and make irrational decisions based on imperfect data. In his landmark treatment of the history of the world's markets, Fox uncovers the new ideas that may come to drive the market in the century ahead.</p>"

Now family duty requires that she make an appearance at a glittering gala, mingling with the cream of London society in hopes of finding a suitable husband.

9780060184889,Outcast,['Jose Latour'],"<p>Curtain call for the Cuban revolution...After 40 years, Havana has slowly disintegrated from the carnivalesque ""showtime"" of Cabrera-Infante’s Three Trapped Tigers to the drably conformist, anesthetized wasteland of Jose Latour’s brilliant new suspense novel, <i>Outcast</i>. In Latour’s Havana, the decline of passion, creativity, and desire is less a result of random violence and political oppression than a function of bureaucratic conformity, petty political ambitions, and loss of nerve—not to mention, of course, the steady attrition of the island’s dreamers, dissidents, and risk-takers to that other utopia to the north, the Cuban diaspora of Miami. With this important new release, Akashic Books introduces readers in the United States to José Latour and the harsh, tense, caustic tradition of Cuban Noir, of which he is an established master. The first Cuban crime novel to be published in the U.S., Outcast is a smart, multi-voiced, savagely unsentimental tale that blends cultural critique, personal discovery, and explosive violence to reveal the callous, impersonal dysfunction of both contemporary Cuban socialism and its self-congratulatory, free-market alternative in Miami.</p>
<p>The son of a Cuban mother and a U.S. laborer stationed on the island before the Revolution, the novel’s protagonist, Elliot Steil, is a down-and-out school teacher in Havana. Quietly resigned to the tedium and simplicity of his life, he has, like many of his fellow Havanans, systematically distanced himself from all aspirations for a better future. Steil’s hopes suddenly resurface when he is offered a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" chance to escape his current situation by a mysterious visitor to the island who claims to be a friend of Steil’s late father. When the stranger quickly turns from savior to would-be assassin, Steil finds himself perilously immersed in the waters of the Florida Straits and in the images of a past that he had spent most of his adult life trying to forget. Steil survives the ordeal, but his journey to find his betrayer and to discover the mystery of his bicultural past lure him into the heart of Miami's Cuban underworld. In the end, the tangle of deceit, corruption, and mutual interest that binds Steil and his enemies results in a dramatic stalemate that perfectly embodies the complexity, and the cynicism, of late twentieth century capitalism.<br>

<p>And thus <b>Lady Rogue</b> was born.</p>
<p>Christine ""Kit"" Brantley is masquerading as a boy because her mission is to spy on Alexander Cale, the Earl of Everton. It doesn't take long for Alex to see through her disguise. Who would mistake this enchanting, albeit cheeky, chit for a lad? Alex is determined to discover the real reason Kit is in London, but as he's dragged into one escapade after another, he finds himself succumbing to her charm and spirit.</p>
<p>I love this book, and I love the new package. In my mind it's a depiction of the first time Kit puts on a ball gown, and the way Alex Cale feels when he first sees her as a lady . . .</p>
<p>Ah, me, now I'm getting sentimental.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Suzanne Enoch</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, and <b>Lady Rogue</b> also marks the debut of Mr. Francis Henning, who's made an appearance in every historical I've written since.</p>

9780061121364,It's Okay To Be The Boss: The Step-by-step Guide To Becoming The Manager Your Employees Need,['Bruce Tulgan'],"<p>Do you feel you don't have enough time to manage your people?</p>
<p>Do you avoid interacting with some employees because you hate the dreaded confrontations that often follow?</p>
<p>Do you have some great employees you really cannot afford to lose?</p>
<p>Do you secretly wish you could be more in control but don't know where to start?</p>
<p>Managing people is harder and more high-pressure today than ever before. There's no room for downtime, waste, or inefficiency. You have to do more with less. And employees have become high maintenance. Not only are they more likely to disagree openly and push back, but they also won't work hard for vague promises of long-term rewards. They look to you—their immediate boss—to help them get what they need and want at work.</p>
<p>How do you tackle this huge management challenge? If you are like most managers, you take a hands-off approach. You ""empower"" employees by leaving them alone, unless they really need you. After all, you don't want to ""micromanage"" them and don't have the time to hold every employee's hand. Of course, problems always come up and often snowball into bigger problems. In fact, you probably spend too much of your time solving problems and falling behind on your work . . . which leaves even less time for managing people . . . which opens the door for even more problems!</p>
<p>In <b>It's Okay to Be the Boss</b>, Bruce Tulgan puts his finger on the biggest problem in corporate America—an undermanagement epidemic affecting managers at all levels of the organization and in all industries—and offers another way. His clear, step-by-step guide to becoming the strong manager employees need challenges bosses everywhere to spell out expectations, tell employees exactly what to do and how to do it, monitor and measure performance constantly, and correct failure quickly and reward success even more quickly. Now that's how you set employees up for success and help them earn what they need. Tulgan opens our eyes to the undisciplined workplace that is overwhelming managers and frustrating workers and invites bosses everywhere to accept the sacred responsibility of managing people. His message: It's okay to be the boss. Be a great one!</p>"

<p><b>The Teen Weight-Loss Solution</b> offers the stories of real teens coping with the heartbreaking physical and emotional consequences of obesity. Dr. Schwartz reveals that the trigger for budding weight problems in teens can often be traced to the beginning of puberty, when their bodies are overloaded with hormones that impact mood, energy, motivation, and weight gain.

<p>Dr. Schwartz's weight-loss solution teaches parents that they must look beyond the notion of managing their teen's weight problem with an old-fashioned forced diet and address not only body weight, but the whole individual. Parents must make the hormonal connection to obesity for their teen and help their doctor devise a plan that will help their child manage his or her health by monitoring diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices.

9780060758875,Guerra en la penumbra: cuentos,"['Alarcón, Daniel , 1977-']","<p>En el mundo, algo extraño está sucediendo: hay movimientos masivos de gente, lenguas y culturas que crecen dislocadas entre guerras y economías en crisis. En pocas palabras, nuestro mundo está cambiando.</p>
<p>En este asombroso libro de cuentos, Daniel Alarcón transporta al lector de los centros urbanos tercermundistas a las líneas fragmentadas que muchas veces dividen naciones y personas. Un terrorista sin remordimientos recuerda sus comienzos, un posible inmigrante contempla las consecuencias de irse y no volver jamás, un reportero cambia su lápiz y papel por el trágico disfraz de un payaso callejero. Son guerras tanto nacionales como internas, que se llevan a cabo en la selva, en las calles de Lima o en la intimidad de un apartamento neoyorquino. Son vidas que se viven al margen del mundo globalizado y sin globalizar, son las historias de quienes constantemente viajan entre mundos diferentes sin jamás sentirse del todo en casa.</p>
<p><b>Guerra en la Penumbra</b> ilumina las grietas con las que todos tropezamos en el mundo moderno. Daniel Alarcón es un talento excepcional, una voz difícil de olvidar una vez el libro llega a su extraordinario y devastador desenlace.</p>"

<p>From the author of the national bestseller <b>The Culture of Fear</b> comes a rallying cry to abandon food fads and myths for calmer and more pleasurable eating.</p>
<p>For many Americans, eating is a religion. We worship at the temples of celebrity chefs. We raise our children to believe that certain foods are good and others are bad. We believe that if we eat the right foods, we will live longer, and if we eat in the right places, we will raise our social status. Yet what we believe to be true about food is, in fact, quite contradictory. Offering part exposé, part social com-mentary, sociologist Barry Glassner talks to chefs, food chemists, nutritionists, and restaurant critics about the way we eat. Helping us recognize the myths, half-truths, and guilt trips they promulgate, <b>The Gospel of Food</b> liberates us for greater joy at the table.</p>"

9780060543556,Cover Up: What The Government Is Still Hiding About The War On Terror,['Peter Lance'],"<p>Ever since 9/11, investigative reporter Peter Lance has been leading the fight to expose the intelligence gaps that led to 9/11. Now, in the follow-up to his bestselling <b>1000 Years for Revenge</b>, he returns with devastating new evidence that the government has been covering up its own counterterror failures since the mid-1990s — and continues today.</p>
<p>In <b>Cover Up</b>, Lance shows how the government chose again and again to sacrifice America's national security for personal motives and political convenience. In its first half, he unveils shattering new evidence that terror mastermind Ramzi Yousef ordered the bombing of TWA 800 from his prison cell in order to effect a mistrial in his own terror bombing case. Astonishingly, the FBI was alerted to Yousef's plans in advance by a prison informant who even passed along his detailed sketch of a bomb-trigger device — a document seen here for the first time. And Lance reveals the shocking reason the Justice Department suddenly ruled the crash anaccident despite overwhelming evidence of the bombing — throwing away its best chance to penetrate the cell that was already planning 9/11.</p>
<p>And the outrage doesn't stop there. In Part II, Lance offers an unofficial ""minority report"" on the 9/11 Commission, critiquing it as the incomplete, highly politicized ""Warren Commission of our time."" He explores potential conflicts of interest among its members, from the staff director who wrote a book with Condoleezza Rice, to the former Clinton deputy attorney general who participated in a critical meeting that upended the TWA probe. He exposes the report's false contention that the 9/11 plan was conceived in 1996, when the FBI had knowledge that the plot was in motion as early as 1994. And, in a heart-stopping, minute-by-minute chronicle of the attacks, he asks dozens of unanswered questions about the defense failures of that day — from why fighter jets weren't scrambled for almost an hour after the hijackings, to why the president and several of his top military advisers remained virtually incommunicado for more than half an hour after it was clear that America was under attack.</p>
<p>At a time when America feels no safer than ever, <b>Cover Up</b> will lend new eyes to readers who want the full story behind the 9/11 attacks — and inspire us all to keep demanding the truth.</p>"

9780061358142,The Breakthrough Imperative: How The Best Managers Get Outstanding Results,"['Gottfredson, Mark.']","<p>Every general manager today—all the way up to the CEO—is expected by his or her stakeholders to achieve new breakthroughs in performance—and fast. Those who don't make visible progress toward that goal within the first year or two will likely find themselves looking for another job. It is precisely because of this growing breakthrough imperative that managers today, whether in corporations or nonprofits, need to get off to a fast start. They don't have time for mistakes or for going back and redoing what they should have done right in the first place.</p>
<p>But, despite the intensity of these pressures, despite the high expectations and short time frames, a number of CEOs and general managers turn in truly exceptional results. How do they meet and exceed the breakthrough imperative? To answer this question, consultants and former managers Mark Gottfredson and Steve Schaubert interviewed more than forty CEOs from both industry and the nonprofit sector, conducted an intensive study of what successful managers do right—and what some do wrong—and drew on their own combined fifty-plus years of experience at Bain &amp; Company, where their insights have consistently been found in the pages of the <b>Harvard Business Review</b>. Together they came up with the four straightforward principles—deceptively simple yet remarkably powerful—that everyone must follow to succeed at achieving breakthrough results:</p>
<blockquote>1. Costs and prices always decline<br>
2. Competitive position determines options<br>
3. Customers and profit pools don't stand still<br>
4. Simplicity gets results</blockquote>
<p>Although seemingly simplistic, mastering these four laws means mastering the basics of great management—a foundation on which to build the rest of one's management strategy. Whether you're managing a small work group or a multinational corporation, a single division or an entire nonprofit, <b>The Breakthrough Imperative</b> presents these core laws of business to help you determine where you are, just how far you can go, and how to get there with stellar results.</p>"

Beautiful Jim Key, the onetime ugly duckling of a scrub colt that became one of the most heralded and beloved heroes of his day, was famous neither for his beauty nor his speed but instead for his exceptional intelligence. Said to have an I.Q. equivalent to that of a human sixth-grader, Jim exploded on to the national scene in 1897 by demonstrating inexplicable abilities to read, write, spell, do mathematics, tell time, sort mail, cite biblical passages, and debate politics.</p>
<p>For the next nine years, Jim performed in nationwide expositions and world's fairs to wildly receptive crowds, smashing box-office records, overcoming hurdles of prejudice and skepticism, all the while winning rapturous praise from the press and leaders such as President McKinley, Booker T. Washington, and Alice Roosevelt Longworth.</p>
<p>In this breathtaking saga, Jim's astonishing journey is coupled with that of his trainer and best friend, Dr. William Key, a self-taught veterinarian, former slave, Civil War veteran, prominent African-American entrepreneur, and one of the most renowned horse whisperers of his time — a man who shunned all force in the training of horses, instead relying on kindness and patience.</p>

Rogers, a dramatic shift took place in the public mind that made kindness to animals a cornerstone of modern civilization and helped launch the animal rights movement. Unveiled against the backdrop of American history, <b>Beautiful Jim Key</b> is their incredible tale.</p>"

Drawing on pre-viously untapped sources, and with unprecedented access to all the major characters, here is the comprehensive and most revealing portrait of John Lennon that is ever likely to be published.</p>
<p>This masterly biography takes a fresh and penetrating look at every aspect of Lennon's much-chronicled life, including the songs that have turned him, posthumously, into a near–secular saint. In three years of research, Norman has turned up an extra-ordinary amount of new information about even the best-known episodes of Lennon folklore—his upbringing by his strict Aunt Mimi; his allegedly wasted school and student days; the evolution of his peerless creative partnership with Paul McCartney; his Beatle-busting love affair with a Japanese performance artist; his forays into painting and literature; his experiments with Transcendental Meditation, primal scream therapy, and drugs. The book's numerous key informants and interviewees include Sir Paul McCartney, Sir George Martin, Sean Lennon—whose moving reminiscence reveals his father as never before—and Yoko Ono, who speaks with sometimes shocking candor about the inner workings of her marriage to John.</p>
<p>Honest and unflinching, as John himself would wish, Norman gives us the whole man in all his endless contradictions—tough and cynical, hilariously funny but also naive, vulnerable and insecure—and reveals how the mother who gave him away as a toddler haunted his mind and his music for the rest of his days.</p>"

9780061251276,The Turnaround Kid: What I Learned Rescuing America's Most Troubled Companies,['Steve Miller'],"<p>For the past thirty years, Steve Miller has done the messy, unpleasant work of salvaging America's lost companies with such success that the <b>Wall Street Journal</b> has dubbed him ""U.S. Industry's Mr. Fix It."" From his very first crisis assignment as point man for Lee Iaccoca's rescue team at Chrysler, Miller built an international reputation while fixing major problems in such varied industries as steel, construction, and health care. Most recently, as chairman and CEO of the bankrupt automotive parts manufacturer Delphi Corporation, he has confronted head-on the major issues threatening the survival of Detroit's Big Three.</p>
<p>A battle is being fought in the heart of industrial America—or what is left of it—Miller observes. In the auto industry as well as every manufacturing corporation, management and labor are at loggerheads over wages and the skyrocketing costs of employee benefits. The way out of this battle is often painful and Miller is deeply aware of the high price individual workers and many communities have had to pay as a result.</p>
<p>In this frank and unsparing memoir, Miller reveals a rarely seen side of American management. Miller recounts the inside story of the many turnaround jobs that have led to his renown as Mr. Fix It. But he also paints an intimate picture of his relationship with Maggie Miller, his wife of forty years, with whom Miller shares the credit for his success. Described by Miller as ""my mentor and tormentor,"" Maggie served as his most trusted adviser and kept him focused on what truly matters until her death from brain cancer in 2006.</p>
<p>A deeply moving personal story and timely snapshot of the state of American manufacturing and what it will take to restore it to profitability, <b>The Turnaround Kid</b> is Steve Miller's fascinating look at his education as an American executive.</p>"

9780060958312,Hawk: Occupation: Skateboarder,"['Tony Hawk', 'Sean Mortimer']","<p>For Tony Hawk, it wasn't enough to skate for two decades, to invent more than eighty tricks, and to win more than twice as many professional contests as any other skater.It wasn't enough to knock himself unconscious more than ten times, fracture several ribs, break his elbow, knock out his teeth twice, compress the vertebrae in his back, pop his bursa sack, get more than fifty stitches laced into his shins, rip apart the cartilage in his knee, bruise his tailbone, sprain his ankles, and tear his ligaments too many times to count.No.He had to land the 900. And after thirteen years of failed attempts, he nailed it. It had never been done before.</p>
<p>Growing up in Sierra Mesa, California, Tony was a hyperactive demon child with an I44 IQ. He threw tantrums, terrorized the nanny until she quit, exploded with rage whenever he lost a game; this was a kid who was expelled from <b>preschool</b>. When his brother, Steve, gave him a blue plastic hand-me-down skateboard and his father built a skate ramp in the driveway, Tony finally found his outlet—while skating, he could be as hard on himself as he was on everyone around him.</p>
<p>But it wasn't an easy ride to the top of the skating game. Fellow skaters mocked his skating style and dubbed him a circus skater. He was so skinny he had to wear elbow pads on his knees, and so light he had to ollie just to catch air off a ramp. He was so desperate to be accepted by young skating legends like Steve Caballero, Mike McGill, and Christian Hosoi that he ate gum from between Steve's toes. But a few years of determination and hard work paid off in multiple professional wins, and the skaters who once had mocked him were now trying to learn his tricks. Tony had created a new style of skating.</p>
<p>In <b>Hawk</b> Tony goes behind the scenes of competitions, demos, and movies and shares the less glamorous demands of being a skateboarder—from skating on Italian TV wearing see-through plastic shorts to doing a demo in Brazil after throwing up for five days straight from food poisoning. He's dealt with teammates who lit themselves and other subjects on fire, driving down a freeway as the dashboard of their van burned. He's gone through the unpredictable ride of the skateboard industry during which, in the span of a few years, his annual income shrank to what he had made in a single month and then rebounded into seven figures. But Tony's greatest difficulty was dealing with the loss of his number one fan and supporter—his dad, Frank Hawk.</p>
<p>With brutal honesty, Tony recalls the stories of love, loss, bad hairdos, embarrassing '80s clothes, and his determination that had shaped his life. As he takes a look back at his experiences with the skateboarding legends of the '70s, '80s, and '90s, including Stacy Peralta, Eddie Elguera, Lance Mountain, Mark Gonzalez, Bob Burnquist, and Colin Mckay, he tells the real history of skateboarding—and also what the future has in store for the sport and for him.</p>

9780060013769,"Happy Days Are Here Again: The 1932 Democratic Convention, The Emergence Of Fdr-and How America Was Changed Forever",['Steven Neal'],"<p>Franklin Roosevelt was one of our greatest and most beloved presidents — and yet he almost didn't get his party's nomination during his first run for the White House. <b>Happy Days Are Here Again</b> re-creates the crazy scheming, backroom plotting, and infighting of the 1932 Democratic convention — a major historical event that took place over just a few days but determined the course of American politics for generations.</p>
<p>The extraordinary Chicago convention of 1932, rendered so vividly and dramatically by award-winning biographer Steve Neal, was one of the most suspenseful in our nation's history. Roosevelt may have entered the Chicago convention with the highest number of delegates, but the structure and rules of the nomination process prevented him from being a shoe-in. In fact, there were several viable contenders — among them Al Smith, Newton D. Baker, John Nance Garner, and Albert C. Ritchie — who also could have faced Herbert Hoover in the upcoming general election. With the Depression under way, it was not lost on those at this particular convention that they were not only selecting a nominee but also a president.</p>
<p>Among the dazzling and influential personalities Neal weaves into this high-stakes drama are Joseph P. Kennedy, William Randolph Hearst, Huey Long, Bernard Baruch, Will Rogers, Clarence Darrow, Amelia Earhart, Duke Ellington, and John Dos Passos. All of these players gathered during a Chicago summer to do battle over the leadership of their party and, consequently, the White House.</p>
<p><b>Happy Days Are Here Again</b> calls on a wealth of primary sources and new information to provide a fresh perspective on this crucial moment in history, yet it is written with the exciting narrative pull of a novel. Ultimately, this is the untold story of the pivotal contest that remade the Democratic Party, marking the end of an era and the birth of modern America.</p>"

<p>The face of the American voter has changed dramatically. With the growth of the Latino population in the United States, there has developed a voting block with the potential to determine the outcome of elections throughout the nation. Hispanics in America, both native-born as well as newly arrived immigrants, will forever alter the way this country votes, and even how the nation views itself.</p>
<p>With its staggering population of close to 40 million and growing, Latinos became the largest minority in America in 2003. The monumental effect Hispanics will have on all areas of American culture, especially politics, will be acutely felt as the road to the 2004 presidential election heats up.</p>
<p>Ramos argues that the political party that can correctly understand the wants and needs of Hispanics will triumph in most elections throughout the country, pushing forward that party's agenda and solidifying its hold on power.</p>
<p>Yet, do Hispanics vote as a block? What issues are important to Latinos? And are these issues really that different from non-Latino Americans? In <em>The Latino Wave</em>, Jorge Ramos deftly clarifies these points, among many others.</p>
<p>With interviews from the nation's Latino political luminaries, as well as fieldwork interviews with Hispanics living across the entirety of the United States, Ramos shows just who these New Americans really are. By outlining what political issues are important to them, Ramos underscores why America should care about bridging the gap of misunderstanding that exists between Latinos and non-Latinos alike, during this, the most divisive presidential election the country has witnessed in decades.</p>


                        <p>From bestselling author and award winning journalist Jorge Ramos, comes a pivotal new book which explores the current and future power of the Latino vote in American politics and helps to define the issues important to this community, as well as what it will take for a party and candidate to capture their loyalty.

Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children — misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings — hopeful, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly anyway).</p>


                        <p>In a slim collection of drawings and verse stories that owes much to the cross-hatched, macabre world of Edward Gorey, the visually ingenious filmmaker Tim Burton (Batman; Edward Scissorhands) tries his hand in The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories at a quieter, more delicate medium. Quirky pen-and-ink drawings accompany a minimalist text, stories that are a distillation of Burton's characteristic mixture of the touching and the bizarre. In ""Voodoo Girl,"" one of Burton's odd creatures ""knows she has a curse on her, a curse she cannot win./ For if someone gets/ too close to her,/ the pins stick further in.""

When author Wendell Steavenson became intrigued by his story, she began with a few questions about Sachet and his fellow Baathist loyalists: ""Why had they served such a regime? How had they accommodated their own morality? How had they lived? How had they lived with themselves?"" Her journey to find these answers took five years, and an accumulation of facts, opinions, fears, confessions and suspicions from Sachet's family, friends, and enemies. The result is not just a gripping account of one man's rise and fall, but a vivid and compassionate portrayal of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>As Sachet rose from policeman to Special Forces officer and then General, he made more and more sacrifices to remain in Saddam's good favor. Steadfast in his loyalty to God and his President, Sachet attended military executions and endured his own imprisonment as Saddam's behavior took increasingly paranoiac and power-crazy turns. But when it came time for Sachet's sons to do their military service, he refused to let them join the ""criminal"" organization to which he had given his life. Kamel Sachet realized, too late, that he'd become a participant in the terror regime that had strangled his county and destroyed its people. Through his story and the stories of those around him, Wendell Steavenson shows the choices Iraqis have had to make between exile and collaboration, God and jihad. Here are the Iraqis behind the headlines and the tragedy begotten of unintended consequences.

And could reparations help heal the wounds of the past?</p>
<p>This comprehensive collection — the only of its kind — gathers together the seminal essays and key participants in the debate. Pro-reparations essays, including contributions by Congressman John Conyers Jr., Christopher Hitchens, and Professor Molefi Asante, are countered with arguments by Shelby Steele, Armstrong Williams, and John McWhorter, among others. Also featured are important documents, such as the First Congressional Reparations Bill of 1867 and the Dakar Declaration of 2001, as well as a new chapter on the current status and future direction of the movement.</p>"

He's the solitary curmudgeon with the shack out in the woods, the mystic worshipping solemnly in the quiet church of nature. He's our national Natural Man, the prophet of environmentalism. But here Robert Sullivan—who himself has been called an ""urban Thoreau"" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>)—presents the Thoreau you don't know: the activist, the organizer, the gregarious adventurer, the guy who likes to go camping with friends (even if they sometimes accidentally burn the woods down). Sullivan argues that Walden was a book intended to revive America, a communal work forever pigeonholed as a reclusive one, and this misreading is at the heart of our troubled relationship with the environment today. Sullivan shows us not a lonely eccentric but a man in his growing village: a man who danced and sang, who worked throughout his short life at the family pencil-making business, and moved into his parents' house after leaving Walden, but always paid his father rent. Passionate yet whimsical, <em>The Thoreau You Don't Know</em> asks us to re-examine our everyday relationship with the natural world, and one another.</p>"

<p>Teenage girls face a relentless assault on their self–esteem: television, the Internet, and magazines all barrage young women with images of perfection –– and that perfection is closely linked with being thin. Sadly, research shows that only 14 percent of teenage girls are happy with their body shape and size. More than half of them think they should lose weight. And most shocking of all, obesity among teenagers has tripled in the last decade alone. Young people are victims not only of poor self–esteem and eating disorders, but also of larger health issues.</p>
<p>In <b>The Diet for Teenagers Only</b> , Carrie Wiatt and Barbara Schroeder give teenagers the dietary weapons they need to fight back and make smart, independent decisions about nutrition. Written in a conversational, lighthearted voice, but filled with practical tips and must–have information, <b>The Diet for Teenagers Only</b> is a breakthrough diet plan specifically tailored to fit teenage needs and lifestyles. Among the essential ingredients of this diet you'll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>color cutouts of favorite foods that clarify what portion sizes should look like;</li>
<li>recommended 7–day meal plans for different calorie needs –– and create–your–own–menu options;</li>
<li>easy–to–follow recipes and grocery shopping tips that inspire teenagers to take nutrition into their own hands;</li>
<li>a complete illustrated exercise program to complement weight–loss efforts, boost energy, and strengthen young bodies; and</li>
<li>a personal food diary for charting daily progress.
<p>For teenagers who struggle with food and their weight, or for those who simply want a head start on designing a smart and satisfying food lifestyle, no other diet book will do. <b>The Diet for Teenagers Only</b> serves up fun, safe, and inspirational ways for teenagers to lose weight and be healthy, while never losing sight of the larger picture: While striving to improve your body can be a very healthy goal, learning to love your body is a far more important achievement –– and one that will last a lifetime!</p>

And then things really start to get strange — and passions lead to betrayals lead to violence. <b>The Game</b> is the story of one man's transformation from frog to prince — to prisoner in the most unforgettable book of the year.</p>"

9780061288678,Break Through Your Set Point: How To Finally Lose The Weight You Want And Keep It Off,"['George Blackburn M.d.', 'Julie Corliss']","<p>How many times have you gone on a diet and lost a few pounds, only to hit, once again, that dreaded plateau? Many people manage to lose the first 10, 15, or 20 pounds of the weight they want to shed. Then, no matter how hard they work, they can't seem to nudge the number on the scale farther down, and often they end up gaining back the weight they lost. Finally, there is a healthy, permanent weight-loss solution that will get you off the frustrating yo-yo that often accompanies most fad diets.</p>
<p>Dr. George L. Blackburn is the associate director of the Division of Nutrition at Harvard Medical School and directs the Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine, which investigates complex issues in nutrition and health. Based on three decades of his research and clinical practice, <b>Break Through Your Set Point</b> offers an exciting and effective program that will give you specific tools to help you get out of your rut and prevent those extra pounds from coming back.</p>
<p>Your set point, or typical body weight, is determined by your genes and your environment. Many modern lifestyle habits—including getting too little sleep and eating on the run—have conspired to raise many people's set points to unhealthily high levels. According to Dr. Blackburn's theory, if you set a reasonable goal to lose about 10 percent of your initial body weight, then hold steady at your new weight without regaining any pounds for at least six months, you can reset your body's set point. And once you've reset your set point, you can repeat the cycle to lose even more weight.</p>
<p>The body's innate tendency to protect itself against starvation explains why the body resists losing weight after a certain point. Dr. Blackburn explains the science behind the set-point theory and helps you devise a plan that works for you. With his unique, multi-faceted approach, Dr. Blackburn shows that hitting your set point is not a dead end but the first step in losing weight the right way. This book will help you overcome your weight-loss plateau once and for all.</p>"

Taking a pair of black-handled scissors, she cut open the tops of Granny's pillows. Aunt Blanche asked Mama what in Jehoshaphat's name did she think she was doing, cutting up all the pillows like that. Mama answered something about finding a crown inside one of those pillows Granny Ruth had fashioned from chicken feathers.</p>
<p>""Sometimes,"" she explained, ""when a person sleeps on a pillow for a long time the feathers will mold together to make a crown ...""</p>
<p>It's the 1960s and nine-year-old Karen Spears is living in a trailer in middle Georgia. Her father, David Spears, was killed in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, and left behind three young children and a wife with a ninth-grade education. <b>Hero Mama</b> is the gritty, searing, and beautifully written story of what happened to this Southern family in the aftermath of a soldier's death.</p>
<p>At first the widow Spears appeared to fall apart — turning herself into a beer-guzzling, good-time girl, while her children responded in kind. Eventually she recognized how much her children needed her and, with mule-headed tenacity, she earned her nursing degree and bought the family a real home fashioned from bricks, rising above her own flaws to forge a better life for her kids. Now Karen Spears Zacharias pays tribute to this woman of guts and determination — her Hero Mama — who battled overwhelming adversity to pull her family up and make them proud of her, and of themselves.</p>
<p><b>Hero Mama</b> is also the story of the South, where a young girl grew up against an emotionally charged landscape of racism and bigotry, where the daughter of a fallen soldier had to face the stigma of a war nobody wanted, and where a family in crisis pulled together to achieve its own version of the American dream. It is a triumphant tale of reconciliation between a daughter and her father, a daughter and her nation, and a daughter and the people of Vietnam. It is a story for any daughter who has loved her father — and for any daughter who has had to discover how deeply her mother really loves her.</p>"

Infants are born with the ability to communicate their need to ""go,"" just as they communicate hunger or sleepiness.

Parents who have successfully practiced EC identify common struggles, share experiences and problem-solving tips, and provide encouragement for those new to the technique. Their motivational stories together with Gross-Loh's practical advice will appeal to all parents interested in a fresh alternative to traditional toilet training.</p>"

9780060737986,Surrounded By Idiots: Fighting Liberal Lunacy In America,['Mike Gallagher'],"<p>In <b>Surrounded by Idiots</b>, Mike Gallagher,<br>
one of the top radio talk show hosts in America, takes us to the front lines of the unprecedented cultural and political war confronting all decent Americans</p>
<p>The 2004 election was a watershed moment in our nation's history, and while it was shocking to the left to see so many red states on the electoral map, to conservatives it was just an affirmation of what they'd known all along — conservatives are the mainstream and liberals are the fringe.</p>
<p>It is not the time to rest or take things for granted, Mike Gallagher argues. Not at all. ""Maintaining America's role as the greatest nation in the world means we must stay the course,"" he writes, adding, ""Liberal idiocy surrounds us all. It threatens to destroy the values and lifestyles that millions of us cherish.""</p>
<p>The left has targeted every value and standard, principle and idea, concept of God, family, honor, duty, country, and decency that we hold dear. As the nation battles for its very soul in this post-9/11 world, we have Mike Gallagher to help fight against the agenda-driven liberal lunatics.</p>
<p>The liberal loons are everywhere and Gallagher takes them all on: disgraced President Bill Clinton, and — perish the thought! — possible future president and carpetbagger Hillary Clinton; the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an organization that values the lives of bugs over humans; and the anti-Bush propagandist filmmaker, Michael Moore.</p>
<p>Then there's Gallagher's confrontation with the unpredictable, angry, and bitter bestselling author, liberal pundit, and comedian Al Franken — the story of his anti-Dixie Chicks concert in protest of their un-American comments — and race-baiters like Al Sharpton and big-mouth out-of-touch Hollywood elitists like Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Whoopi Goldberg.</p>

9780060593766,History On Trial: My Day In Court With David Irving,['Deborah E. Lipstadt'],"<p>In 1993, Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of Jewish Studies at Emory University, published the first comprehensive history of the Holocaust denial movement. In this critically acclaimed account, Lipstadt called David Irving -- a prolific, respected, and well-known writer on World War II who had, over the years, made controversial statements about Hitler and the Jews -- one of the most dangerous spokespersons of the denial movement. A year later, when Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin UK, for libel in a London courtroom, the media spotlight fell on Deborah Lipstadt and, by extension, on the historiography of the Holocaust. Five years later, when David Irving lost his case after an intense ten-week trial, Lipstadt's resounding victory was proclaimed on front pages of newspapers worldwide. The implications of the trial, however, were far from over.<br>
History on Trial is Deborah Lipstadt's personal, riveting chronicle of the legal battle with Irving, in which she went from a relatively quiet existence as a professor at an American university to being a defendant in a sensational libel case. This blow-by-blow account reveals how Lipstadt raised $1.5 million for her defense, which included a first-rate team of solicitors, historians, and experts, among them Anthony Julius, a literary scholar who is better known as the late Princess Diana's divorce lawyer. Lipstadt describes how in forced silence she endured Irving's relentless provocations, including his claims that more people died in Senator Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz, that survivors tattooed numbers on their arms to make money, and that nonwhite people are a different""species."" She also reveals how her lawyers gained access to Irving's personal papers, which exposed his association with neo-Nazi extremists in Germany, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, and the National Alliance, which wants to transform America into an ""Aryan society."" In the course of the trial, Lipstadt's legal team stripped away Irving's mask of respectability through exposing the prejudice, extremism, and distortion of history that defined his work, even his once highly regarded account of the Dresden bombing.<br>
Part history, part edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama, History on Trial goes beyond the historiography of World War II and the Holocaust to reveal the intricate way in which extremism and deliberate historical distortions gain widespread legitimacy and help generate hatred. An inspiring personal story of perseverance and unexpected limelight, here is the definitive account of the trial that tested the standards for historical and judicial truths, a trial that the Daily Telegraph of London proclaimed did ""for the new century what the Nuremberg tribunals or the Eichmann trial did for earlier generations.""<br>

Today it is exhibit number one in a forgery trial involving millions of dollars worth of high-end, Biblical era relics, some of which literally re-wrote Near Eastern history and which could lead to the incarceration of some very wealthy men and embarrass major international institutions, including the British Museum and Sotheby's.</p>

9780060841638,The Entrepreneurial Imperative: How America's Economic Miracle Will Reshape The World (and Change Your Life),['Carl J. Schramm Phd'],"<p>In 2004, Carl Schramm, president of the Kauffman Foundation, the world's leading foundation for entrepreneurship, published a groundbreaking essay with a radical premise: that Americans literally have no conception of the secret that truly underlies our economic success, and that for the United States to survive and continue to lead the world's economy, it is imperative we learn to understand and employ that secret.</p>
<p>The secret that has led the American economy to become the world's strongest? Our unparalleled skill as entrepreneurs. As Schramm compellingly shows in this sweeping manifesto, entrepreneurship alone—not anything else—can give America the necessary leverage to remain an economic superpower. Not technology, since everyone now has the same technology, or access to it. Not education—we are years behind other nations in this area. Not basic manufacturing, long since moved overseas from the United States. And not capital markets, now truly global entities.</p>
<p>Drawing on detailed research conducted by the Kauffman Foundation and on his decades of experience as an entrepreneur himself and as a leader and mentor to other entrepreneurs, Schramm persuasively demonstrates in detail what this entrepreneurial imperative means for the way we run universities and foundations, lead companies, make personal job decisions, and even conduct our foreign affairs. <b>The Entrepreneurial Imperative</b> will change not only the way our government, corporations, and nonprofits operate, but also our day-to-day lives as working Americans.</p>"

Kenneth Arroyo Roldan is here to tell you that nobody works in a perfect corporate world. Stellar performance alone will not determine corporate advancement—minorities need to learn and follow the rules of corporate politics. As one African American employee who started as a systems analyst at Xerox observed, ""The reality was that despite your ability, if you weren't playing politics correctly, you would be derailed.""</p>
<p>In <b>Minority Rules</b>, Roldan gives a dose of tough love to minorities in corporate America while educating their majority counterparts. As the CEO of the top U.S. head-hunting firm specializing in placing minorities in fast track jobs, Roldan watched as minority superstars hired at Fortune 500 companies bailed out, disappointed and rejected after only a few years. The problem, Roldan says, is that minorities are not adequately prepared psychologically or culturally for corporate careers. In a six-step plan, he explains how to surmount the obstacles, play corporate hardball, and succeed as a minority in the workplace. Corporate culture is unforgiving to minorities, but it is possible to rise to the top with Roldan as your guide.</p>
<p>With refreshing candor, Roldan prepares minorities both psychologically and culturally for corporate careers. Forget about using affirmative action and discrimination lawsuits to level the playing field. The only way to win is to know the landscape and master the rules of the game—from finding the right mentor to learning the art of networking to focusing on self-reliance, patience, and most of all, performance. Roldan shows minorities how to climb to the top jobs—and keep them.</p>"

9780060559748,"Love & madness: the murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Fourth Earl of Sandwich","['Levy, M. J.']","<p>In eighteenth-century England the aristocracy dominated the imagination, their exploits — and misdeeds — discussed, debated, and gossiped about in the salons and parlors of London. Now author Martin Levy vividly re-creates one of the most shocking and scandalous events of the period, in a riveting true tale of passion, obsession, murder, and courtroom drama.</p>
<p>On a spring evening in the year 1779, a young woman emerged from London's Covent Garden Theatre amid a grand swirl of lords and ladies, their servants and coachmen. From out of the shadows a man emerged, dressed in a black suit. He raised a pistol and fired one fatal shot point-blank into the woman's head. A sudden and brutal murder, it was all the more shocking because of the identities of those involved. The victim was Martha Ray, famed aficionada of fashion and the arts, and longtime live-in mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, high-ranking minister to King George III. The assailant was James Hackman, a respected Anglican minister and Martha Ray's former lover.</p>
<p>It was a savage crime that rocked both British high society and the church, and inflamed the interest and imagination of such renowned personages as Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, noted biographer and lover of prostitutes and executions. And it resulted in a courtroom extravaganza unique in the annals of legal proceedings — where passion was the motive, the madness of ""momentary phrenzy"" the mitigating circum-stance . . . and love the ultimate justification for a crazed act of murder.</p>
<p>With consummate skill, author Martin Levy brings to breathtaking life the sights and sounds of an unparalleled era in history — whenhangings were public entertainment and debauchery was a popular pastime of the wealthy and the titled — and expertly unravels the mystery behind a truly sensational slaying. Fascinating, startling, edifying, and entertaining, <i>Love and Madness</i> is a brilliant tale of crime and punishment as vivid and compelling as the headlines of today.</p>

This was no creation of Tolkien's fantasy, however, but a tool-using, fire-making, cooperatively hunting person. The more Morwood and his colleagues revealed about the find, the more astonishing it became: standing only three feet tall with brains a little larger than a can of cola, the Hobbits forced anthropologists and everyone to reconsider what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Morwood's work was no ordinary academic exercise. Along the way he had to tread warily through the cultural landscape of Indonesia—he has an embarrassing mishap with some hard-to-chew pork—and he demonstrated that sometimes the life of a real archaeologist can be a bit like Indiana Jones's when he risked his neck in an ocean-going raft to experience how ancient Indonesians might have navigated the archipelago.</p>
<p>Even more, Morwood had to navigate the rock shoals of an archaeological bureaucracy that could be obtuse and even spiteful, and when the Hobbits became embroiled in scientific controversy—as no find of such magnitude could avoid—it proved easy for Morwood to get nearly swamped with trouble.

9780061824586,"The Savage City: Race, Murder, And A Generation On The Edge",['T. J. English'],"<p>In the early 1960s, uncertainty and menace gripped New York, crystallizing in a poisonous divide between a deeply corrupt, cynical, and racist police force, and an African American community buffeted by economicdistress, brutality, and narcotics. On August 28, 1963—the day Martin Luther King Jr. declared ""I have a dream"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial—two young white women were murdered in their Manhattan apartment. Dubbed the Career Girls Murders case, the crime sent ripples of fear throughout the city, as police scrambled fruitlessly for months to find the killer. But it also marked the start of a ten-year saga of fear, racial violence, and turmoil in the city—an era that took in events from the Harlem Riots of the mid-1960s to the Panther Twenty-One trials and Knapp Commission police corruption hearings of the early 1970s.</p>
<p><b>The Savage City</b> explores this pivotal and traumatic decade through the stories of three very different men:</p>
<ul>
<li>George Whitmore Jr., the near-blind, destitute nineteen-year-old black man who was coerced into confessing to the Career Girls Murders and several other crimes. Whitmore, an innocent man, would spend the decade in and out of the justice system, becoming a scapegoat for the NYPD—and a symbol of the inequities of the system.</li>
<li>Bill Phillips, a brazenly crooked NYPD officer who spent years plundering the system before being caught in a corruption sting—and turning jaybird to create the largest scandal in the department's history.</li>

9780060736804,The Secret History Of The Iraq War,['Yossef Bodansky'],"<p>In the months leading up to March 2003, fresh from its swift and heady victory in Afghanistan, the Bush administration mobilized the United States armed forces to overthrow the government of Iraq. Eight months after the president declared an end to major combat operations, Saddam Hussein was captured in a farmhouse in Al-Dawr. And yet neither peace nor democracy has taken hold in Iraq; instead the country has plunged into terrorist insurgency and guerrilla warfare, with no end in sight.What went wrong?</p>
<p>In <b>The Secret History of the Iraq War</b>, bestselling author Yossef Bodansky offers an astonishing new account of the war and its aftermath—a war that was doomed from the start, he argues, by the massive and systemic failures of the American intelligence community. Drawing back the curtain of politicized debate, Bodansky—a longtime expert and director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare—reveals that nearly every aspect of America's conflict with Iraq has been misunderstood, in both the court of public opinion and the White House itself. Among his revelations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most authoritative account of Saddam Hussein's support for Islamic terrorist organizations—including extensive new reporting on his active cooperation with al-Qaeda in Iraq long after the fall of Baghdad</li>
<li>Extensive new information on Iraq's major chemical and biological weapons programs—including North Korea's role in building still-undetected secret storage facilities and Iraq's transfer of banned materials to Syria, Iran, and Libya</li>
<li>The first account of Saddam's plan for Iraq, Syria, and Iran to join Yasser Arafat's Palestinian forces to attack Israel, throw the region into turmoil, and upend the American campaign</li>
<li>The untold story of Russia's attempt to launch a coup against Saddam before the war—and how the CIA thwarted it by ensuring that Iraq was forewarned</li>
<li>Dramatic details about Saddam's final days on the run, including the untold story of a near miss with U.S. troops and the stunning revelation that Saddam was already in custody at the time of his capture—and was probably betrayed by members of his own Tikriti clan</li>
<li>The definitive account of the anti-U.S. resistance and uprising in Iraq, as the American invasion ignited an Islamic jihad and Iran-inspired intifada, threatening to plunge the region into irreversible chaos fueled by hatred and revenge</li>
<li>Revelations about the direct involvement of Osama bin Laden in the terrorism campaigns in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the Middle East—including the major role played by Iran and HizbAllah in al-Qaeda's operations</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawing upon an extraordinary wealth of previously untapped intelligence and regional sources, <b>The Secret History of the Iraq War</b> presents the most detailed, fascinating, and convincing account of the most controversial war of our times—and offers a sobering indictment of an intelligence system that failed the White House, the American military, and the people of the Middle East.</p>"

Hayes'],"<p>In the same tradition as <b>Sisters</b> &nbsp; and <b>Simple Abundance</b>, <b>Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma</b>&nbsp; explores the deep-rooted connections between grandmother and grandchild and the boundary between memory and experience. It shares with readers a timeless string of wisdom, warmth and wit from celebrities, political and business leaders, authors, children and others eager to reminisce about the profound effect their grandmothers had on their lives.</p>
<p>With an introduction by Demi Moore, <b>Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma</b>&nbsp; is full of interesting personal stories and quotes from a multicultural swath of American society, from people like George and Barbara Bush, Alice Hoffman, Margaret Atwood, Edwidge Dandicott and Toni Braxton. The grandmother of noted fashion designer Vera Wang once told her: ""Always eat before going out, because it's very unfeminine to eat like a horse."" Writer Dawna Markova tells us how her grandmother taught her to look at a boy who was missing his legs and see the love and riches he possessed, more so than the elegant man in a fur coat standing next to him. ""Feel what it is like to be him,"" her grandmother said. ""Feel his heart. Now look at him again. Look at that heart. It's pure gold and wide as the sky. He's a rich old soul whose path is to teach all of us about joy.""</p>
<p> Together, these voices of love paint a heartfelt portrait of everything a grandmother can be: a healer, a guide and inspiration.</p>


                        <p>Collecting the first-person recollections of writers, actors and media people like Christie Brinkley and Roslyn Carter, Jennifer Gates Hayes distills the Pearls of Wisdom from Grandma they carry with them. Demi Moore introduces the many women who shaped those who shape our culture. Anecdotes and aphorisms range from the heartfelt ""Cooking for someone is the best way to express your love for them"" to the practical: ""You shouldn't be a cheerleader, it will hurt your female organs-all that pounding.""

9780060005696,The Paradox Of Choice: Why More Is Less,['Barry Schwartz'],"<p>In the spirit of Alvin Toffler’s <b>Future Shock</b>, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. This paperback includes a new P.S. section with author interviews, insights, features, suggested readings, and more.</p>
<p>Whether we’re buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions—both big and small—have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented.</p>
<p>We assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.</p>
<p>In <b>The Paradox of Choice</b>, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice—the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish—becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice—from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs—has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.</p>
<p>By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counterintuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on the important ones and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.</p>"

9780060580599,Rough Edges: My Unlikely Road From Welfare To Washington,['James E. Rogan'],"<p>Jim Rogan was born to a single mother—a cocktail waitress who was later convicted of welfare fraud; his bartender-father abandoned them both before he was born. After a rough-and-tumble childhood in San Francisco's hardscrabble Mission District—where he was raised by his colorful extended family—he became a political junkie at the age of nine, and once received help with his homework from Harry Truman. But Rogan traveled with a tough circle of friends; after years of borderline delinquency he was expelled from high school, became a porn theater bouncer, and then a bartender at a strip joint and a Hell's Angels bar. Along the way, a young Arkansas politician advised him to study law and become a member of a different kind of bar.</p>
<p>In time Rogan scrapped his way through college and law school. He was appointed a Los Angeles County DA, prosecuting members of the notorious Crips and Bloods gangs; then became a judge, a state legislator, and finally a congressman from Southern California. And in 1998, as a Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, he found himself prosecuting the impeachment of the President of the United States—Bill Clinton, the same Arkansas politician who advised him to go into law and politics two decades earlier.</p>
<p><em>Rough Edges</em> is a rarity among Washington tales: full of outrageous stories, wild humor, pull-no-punches candor, and downright fun. Replete with character and characters, and told in Rogan's engaging and unswervingly frank voice, Rogan's story is certainly the most freewheeling—and perhaps the most honest—political memoir ever written.</p>"

<blockquote>
<p>She's Dr. Isabel Favor, America's diva of self-help.<br>
He's Ren Gage, Hollywood's favorite villain.<br>
Sometimes you just know that God has a sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Isabel Favor, author of <b>Four Cornerstones for a Favorable Life,</b> has sacrificed everything to build her self-help empire. Then, in a matter of weeks, it all comes crashing down. She loses her money to an unscrupulous accountant, her fiancé to a frumpy older woman, and her reputation to headlines denouncing her as a fraud. America's diva of self-help soon discovers she can fix everyone's life but her own. Broke, heartsick, and soul-weary, she heads for Italy in search of a little breathing room.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Gage makes his living killing people... on the silver screen, that is. He's viciously handsome and sublimely talented. But as he begins his vacation in Italy, he's also vaguely dissatisfied. Being a villain with a face to die for has its rewards, but he hates the feeling that everything he's neglected in life is catching up with him. Then he spots Isabel sipping a glass of wine in a sidewalk café. A good guy wouldn't think of seducing such a tidy-looking woman... but he'd never seen the fun in playing the hero.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long for Isabel to realize she's escaped one kind of chaos only to be plunged into another. Even the shelter of a simple stone farmhouse nestled in a Tuscan olive grove can't provide her with the refuge she needs—not when the townspeople are scheming to drive her away, and her plan to restore her reputation has come up empty. And especially not when the man who deceived her refuses to leave her in peace.</p>

This is a story of hope and renewal, of love and redemption when it's needed the most. Sometimes it takes a special place... a special love... a little breathing room... for life to deliver all its glorious promise.</p>"

Set in the mythical small city of Sparta, New York, this searing, vividly rendered exploration of the mysterious conjunction of erotic romance and tragic violence in late-twentieth-century America returns to the emotional and geographical terrain of acclaimed author Joyce Carol Oates's previous bestsellers We Were the Mulvaneys and The Gravedigger's Daughter.<br>

Though not quite as tall as Everest, it is far more dangerous. Located at the border of China and Pakistan in the remote Karakoram range, K2 has some of the harshest climbing conditions and weather of any place in the world. At the beginning of the 2004 climbing season, ninety women had successfully summited Everest, but only five female climbers had reached the peak of K2. Today, all of those brave pioneers are dead.</p>
<p>In 1986 Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz became the first woman ever to reach the top of K2 and was followed to the summit that same year by French climber Liliane Barrard and British climber Julie Tullis, both of whom died on their way down the mountain. Then in 1992, the summer that Rutkiewicz perished on Kangchenjunga, French alpinist Chantal Mauduit summited K2 and survived, only to die six years later on another 8,000-meter peak. Finally, in 1995 British climber and mother Alison Hargreaves reached the top but was killed shortly after starting her descent from its perilous summit. These courageous, remarkable women can no longer tell their tales of defeating the ferocious mountain. Jennifer Jordan, a journalist and filmmaker, tells the haunting and compelling, sometimes tragic, stories of how these women lived and died on the mountains they pursued.</p>

9780061777110,Marley Y Yo: La Vida Y El Amor Con El Peor Perro Del Mundo (spanish Edition),['John Grogan'],"<p>La conmovedora e inolvidable historia de una familia y su maravillosamente neurótico perro, quien les enseña lo que realmente importa en la vida.</p>"
9780060591830,Once Minutos,['Paulo Coelho'],"<p>La nueva novela de Paulo Coelho, autor del bestseller internacional <i>El Alquimista</i>, es la historia de María, una joven prostituta del interior de Brasil, cuyas primeras experiencias inocentes en el amor la dejan con el corazón destrozado.</p>
<p>A una temprana edad, María se convence de que nunca encontrará el amor verdadero, creyendo en su lugar que ""el amor es algo terrible que te hará sufrir."" Un encuentro casual en Río de Janeiro la lleva a Ginebra, donde ella soñaba encontrar fama y fortuna, pero acaba trabajando como prostituta. En Ginebra, María se aleja cada vez más del amor a la vez que desarrolla una fascinación por el sexo.</p>
<p>Decir que <i>Once minutos</i> es la historia de una prostituta sería dar una definición muy simplista. Más importantes que la trayectoria de María, Coelho muestra que ella es capaz de extraer razón de sus duras experiencias en el exterior. María escribe en su diario: ""Los evangelios y todos los textos sagrados de todas las religiones fueron escritos en el exilio, en busca de la comprensión de Dios (...), es en ese momento cuando se escriben los libros, cuando se pintan los cuadros, porque no queremos y no podemos olvidar quiénes somos.""</p>
<p>Coelho sugiere que nunca se propone crear o evitar polémicas en sus historias; su compromiso es tan sólo hablar de aquello que le preocupa, y no de aquello que a la gente le gustaría oír. ""Algunos libros nos hacen soñar, otros nos traen de vuelta a la realidad, pero ninguno puede rehuir lo que es más importante para un autor: ser honesto con aquello sobre lo que escribe,"" explica.</p>
<p>El título de <i>Once minutos</i> está inspirado en la novela <i>Los siete minutos</i>, de Irving Wallace, publicada en los años '70. Este antiguo bestseller trata de una larga batalla legal a propósito de la prohibición de un libro que describe minuciosamente los siete minutos de duración de una relación sexual. Como tal obra jamás existió, Paulo Coelho imaginaba cuál sería su contenido, hasta que se decidió a escribirlo. La idea fue abandonada, pero quedó como inspiración del título (cambiado a <i>Once Minutos</i> por considerar el escritor que la estimación de Wallace era demasiado conservadora), y como el intento de hablar de la asociación y disociación de los placeres del cuerpo y el alma.</p>
<p>En 1999, después de una conferencia en Italia, Coelho recibió en su hotel el manuscrito de una prostituta brasileña, Sonia, que contaba su vida en Europa. Este texto le interesó, y, tres años más tarde, pudo por fin conocerla en persona. Fue en Zurich, Suiza, donde ella lo llevó a la zona de prostitución, el Langstrasse, y la visita se convirtió en una insólita noche de autógrafos con las compañeras de Sonia. Después de que el hecho apareciera en la prensa, varias prostitutas más, de diversas nacionalidades, entregaron sus manuscritos a Coelho en otra tarde de autógrafos, en Ginebra. Así fue cómo conoció a María, a Amy, a Vanessa y a tantas otras. De ahí surgieron su personaje y el hilo conductor de <i>Once minutos</i>.</p>
<p>""Para escribir sobre el lado sagrado del sexo, primero tenía que entender por qué éste había sido profanado de esa manera. Mi libro no se propone ser un estudio de la prostitución. He intentado huir por completo de cualquier tono moralista, de juzgar al personaje principal por la decisión que toma. Lo que me interesa de verdad es la relación de las personas con el sexo.""</p>"

<p>Now <b>What Color Is Your Diet?</b> introduces Dr. Heber's ""Eat for Your Genes"" food plans — revolutionary approaches incorporating the latest breakthroughs in nutritional and genetic research — and his unique 7 Colors of Health food-selection system, which groups fruits and vegetables by the colorful, beneficial chemical substances they contain.

His boyhood is shaped by the Widow Dorsett, a strong mountain woman who teaches him to hunt and to survive the taunts of others. In the hills of southern West Virginia, a boy grows up fast. Trenchmouth sips moonshine, handles snakes, pleases women, and masters the rifle—a skill that lands him in the middle of the West Virginia coal wars. A teenaged union sniper, Trenchmouth is exiled to the back-woods of Appalachia's foothills, where he spends his years running from the past. But trouble will sniff a man down, and an outlaw will eventually run home. Here Trenchmouth Taggart's story, like the best ballads, etches its mark deep upon the memory.</p>"
9780061192036,"He's Just Not Up For It Anymore: Why Men Stop Having Sex, And What You Can Do About It","['Bob Berkowitz', 'Susan Yager-berkowitz']","<p>Men not interested in sex? Can this really be true? It is for the estimated 20 million American men and women who are in relationships in which the man has stopped being sexually intimate. This breakthrough book reveals the counterintuitive truth: <b>Many men are just not up for it anymore.</b> To find out why, bestselling author and relationship expert Dr. Bob Berkowitz and his wife, Susan Yager-Berkowitz, began an unprecedented survey of more than 4,000 men and women in this situation, gathering data and following up with hundreds of interviews with selected respondents.</p>
<p>Why don't these men want to have sex? Is the problem physical, emotional, or psychological—or are these guys simply bored with their partners? Is it unexpressed anger about other aspects of their relationships? Are they depressed? Now that there is limitless access to pornography, are some men no longer able to be turned on without it? Are they becoming satiated? Do they have a fully functioning libido, just not for their wives? Or is decreased interest in sex just an unacknowledged but natural fact of life for a lot of men? Do they want their libidos back?</p>
<p>Further, how do their partners feel about this? Are they dejected or relieved? Do they suspect infidelity, asexuality or homosexuality, or just blame themselves? What are they doing about it? What can they do?</p>
<p><b>He's Just Not Up for It Anymore</b> provides a unique window into the sexless man's mind—so that men and women can understand this important issue and begin to address the problems that have inhibited intimacy, and ultimately solve them.</p>"
9780060580490,Rational Exuberance: Silencing The Enemies Of Growth And Why The Future Is Better Than You Think,"['Mandel, Michael J.']","<p>Michael J. Mandel, chief economist of <i>BusinessWeek</i>, is the country's most passionate partisan for exuberant economic growth. In the mid-1990s, he was one of the first journalists to use the term ""New Economy"" to describe the fast-growing but volatile U.S. economy, supercharged by technology and finance. Mandel's understanding of the true underpinnings of the 1990s economy led to his prescient warning that the Internet bubble was about to burst, which he predicted in his book <i>The Coming Internet Depression</i>.</p>
<p>Now Mandel is issuing another warning. Without exuberant, technology-driven growth, the U.S. economy will lack the firepower to solve its social problems. Without breakthrough innovations like the internal combustion engine or the Internet, the U.S. economy simply can't create enough jobs or wealth to provide for its citizenry.</p>
<p>Yet exuberant growth is stigmatized as immoral by some and bad public policy by others. And economists, surprisingly enough, are the biggest enemies of innovative, transformative growth. Mandel, a Ph.D. in economics himself, believes his colleagues in the dismal profession are a big part of the problem. Focusing on what he labels the single biggest failure in modern economics, Mandel blames <i>New York Times</i> columnist Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, and Greg Mankiw, President Bush's head of the Council of Economic Advisers, for misleading generations of students and slanting public policy against scientific innovation.</p>
<p>Lively, opinionated, and controversial, Mandel's thinking will serve as a rallying cry for the creation of a new political coalition dedicated to economic growth. He calls on SiliconValley to take their case to Washington, and to shift the debate from arguing about trade and budget deficits to solutions, such as more support for research, start-ups, and workforce training. Mandel is sure to kick-start that debate.</p>

That tradition continues with the 18th edition of <b>Etiquette</b>, which welcomes a new generation of Posts—Anna Post, Lizzie Post, and Daniel Post Senning—the great-great grandchildren of Emily Post. Led by Peggy Post, author of the 16th and 17th editions of <b>Etiquette</b>, this team shows how twenty-first-century manners are a combination of kindness, confidence, and awareness.</p>

Ward'],"<p>More than 200 million years ago, a cataclysmic event known as the Permian extinction destroyed more than 90% of all species and nearly 97% of all living things. Its origins have long been a puzzle for paleontologists, and during the 1990s and the early part of this century a great battle was fought between those who thought that death had come from above and those who thought something more complicated was at work.</p>
<p>Paleontologist Peter D. Ward, fresh from helping prove that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs, turned to the Permian problem, and he has come to a stunning conclusion. In his investigations of the fates of several groups of mollusks during those extinctions and others, he discovered that the near-total devastation at the end of the Permian was caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide leading to climate change. But it's not the heat (nor the humidity) that's directly responsible for the extinctions, and the story of the discovery of what is responsible makes for an fascinating, globe-spanning adventure.</p>"

And for those interested in questions of national security and safety, it is a call to action for those concerned with protecting present and future generations from preventable biological catastrophes.</p><p><i>Lab 257</i> will change forever our current understanding of Plum Island -- a place that is, in the words of one insider, a biological Three Mile Island.</p>"

<p>Lord Bramwell Johns, the second son of a duke, is an unrepentant scoundrel. Now that his two closest friends are disgustingly ensconced in domestic bliss, Bram is feeling strangely restless. And not even relieving London's least deserving artistocrats of their ill-gotten jewels is enough—until the night he overhears an argument. It seems that Lady Rosamund Davies is about to be forced into marriage with a rogue even worse than himself.</p>
<p>Rose is well aware of Bram's scandalous reputation, so any reason for his sudden interest in her is suspect; more so since he's close friends with the man about to ruin her family! She has her own plan though, and Bram may be just what she requires—as long as she remembers that he is only looking out for himself.

His lean handsomeness turns the heads of naïve debutantes, while his sensual allure ensures he never lacks for more sophisticated partners for a night, or more, of pleasure. Yet despite all of this, Simon knows that there is something—or rather someone—missing in his life.</p>
<p>To achieve true contentment, Simon must find a lady accomplished enough to be his wife, someone who will spend her days as a member of one of England's most influential families ... and her nights pursuing duties of a more private—and personal—nature.</p>
<p>But Simon knows what to expect if he reveals his intention to choose a bride; nothing could be more tiresome than having every blushing miss on the marriage mart thrust upon him. So he discreetly begins his search at a house party at Glossup Hall . . . and is astonished that the lady who immediately captures his interest is Portia Ashford.</p>
<p>Simon has never considered Portia as a potential wife. He's known the raven-haired beauty since childhood; she's willfully independent and has always claimed to be uninterested in marriage. But an unexpectedly heated kiss abruptly alters the rules of their decade-long interaction. Soon they begin to long for the moments they can spend in each other's arms.</p>
<p>But all is not as it seems at Glossup Hall. As Simon and Portia begin to explore the depths of their mutual passion, a shocking murder is committed ... and it appears that the next victim will be Portia herself. And even more shocking than the fact that a murderer secretly walks among them is the realization that all of Simon's considerable strength and influence may not be enough to protect Portia—his once and always perfect lover . . .</p>"

9780060758691,Get Back In The Box: Innovation From The Inside Out,['Douglas Rushkoff'],"<p>On a landscape that seems to be transforming itself with every new technology, marketing tactic, or investment strategy, businesses rush to embrace change by trading in their competencies or shifting their focus altogether. All in the name of innovation.</p>
<p>But this endless worrying, wriggling, and trend watching only alienates companies from whatever it is they really do best. In the midst of the headlong rush to think ""outside the box,"" the full engagement responsible for true innovation is lost. New consultants, new packaging, new marketing schemes, or even new CEOs are no substitute for the evolution of our own expertise as individuals and as businesses.</p>
<p>Indeed, for all their talk about innovation, most companies today are still scared to death of it.</p>
<p>To <b>Douglas Rushkoff</b>, this disconnect is not only predictable but welcome. It marks the happy end of a business cycle that began as long ago as the Renaissance, and ended with the renaissance in creativity and collaboration we're going through today.</p>
<p>The age of mass production, mass media, and mass marketing may be over, but so, too, is the alienation it engendered between producers and consumers, managers and employees, executives and shareholders, and, worst of all, businesses and their own core values and competencies.</p>
<p>American enterprise, in particular, is at a crossroads. Having for too long replaced innovation with acquisitions, tactics, efficiencies, and ad campaigns, many businesses have dangerously lost touch with the process — and fun — of discovery.</p>
<p>""American companies are obsessed with window dressing,"" Rushkoff writes, ""because they're reluctant, no, afraid to look at whatever it is they really do and evaluate it from the inside out. When things are down, CEOs look to consultants and marketers to rethink, rebrand, or repackage whatever it is they are selling, when they should be getting back on the factory floor, into the stores, or out to the research labs where their product is actually made, sold, or conceived.""</p>
<p>Rushkoff backs up his arguments with a myriad of intriguing historical examples as well as familiar gut checks — from the dumbwaiter and open source to Volkswagen and The Gap — in this accessible, thought-provoking, and immediately applicable set of insights. Here's all the help innovators of this era need to reconnect with their own core competencies as well as the passion fueling them.</p>"

Having been raised in the church, she knew that when much is given much is expected, so she asked God to send her a purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose turned out to be a town: Henry Adams, Kansas, one of the last surviving townships founded by freed slaves after the Civil War. The failing town had put itself up for sale on the Internet, so Bernadine bought it.</p>
<p>Trent July is the mayor, and watching the town of his birth slide into debt and foreclosure is about the hardest thing he's ever done. When the buyer comes to town, he's impressed by her vision, strength, and the hope she wants to offer not only to the town and its few remaining residents, but to a handful of kids in desperate need of a second chance.</p>
<p>Not everyone in town wants to get on board though; they don't want change. But Bernadine and Trent, along with his first love, Lily Fontaine, are determined to preserve the town's legacy while ushering in a new era with ties to its unique past and its promising future.</p>"

9780061139109,The Perils Of Peace: America's Struggle For Survival After Yorktown,"['Fleming, Thomas J.']","<p>On October 19, 1781, Great Britain's best army surrendered to General George Washington at Yorktown. But the future of the 13 former colonies was far from clear. A 13,000 man British army still occupied New York City, and another 13,000 regulars and armed loyalists were scattered from Canada to Savannah, Georgia. Meanwhile, Congress had declined to a mere 24 members, and the national treasury was empty. The American army had not been paid for years and was on the brink of mutiny.</p>
<p>In Europe, America's only ally, France, teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and was soon reeling from a disastrous naval defeat in the Caribbean. A stubborn George III dismissed Yorktown as a minor defeat and refused to yield an acre of ""my dominions"" in America. In Paris, Ambassador Benjamin Franklin confronted violent hostility to France among his fellow members of the American peace delegation.</p>
<p>In his riveting new book, Thomas Fleming moves elegantly between the key players in this drama and shows that the outcome we take for granted was far from certain. Not without anguish, General Washington resisted the urgings of many officers to seize power and held the angry army together until peace and independence arrived. With fresh research and masterful storytelling, Fleming breathes new life into this tumultuous but little known period in America's history.</p>"

<p>""I advocate glamour. Every day. Every minute.""</p>
<p>I'm a good dancer and a nice girl, but I'm a <b>great</b> showgirl. I sell, in a word, magic. Burlesque is a world of illusion and dreams and of course, the striptease.

But her plans to move herself and her loyal audience to another network were cancelled when she ended up at the bottom of her swimming pool. And the fabled unicorn amulet that Constance had been wearing during her final hours—a gift from King Arthur to his beloved Guinevere and the centerpiece of the upcoming Camelot exhibit at New York's Cloisters museum—is missing.</p>
<p>A morning show veteran and now anchor of the <b>KEY Evening Headlines,</b> Eliza Blake is shocked by the death of her former colleague, and is determined to discover who wanted Constance out of the way . . . and why. To do so, she enlists the aid of three KEY News coworkers: ""Jane-of-all-trades"" Annabelle Murphy, who can switch from producing to sleuthing at a moment's notice; charming and fearless cameraman extraordinaire B.J. D'Elia to add brains, brawn, and a much-needed male perspective to the team; and Dr. Margo Gonzalez, on-air psychiatrist, who understands the complex puzzles of the human mind. Calling themselves ""The Sunrise Suspense Society,"" they set out to get to the bottom of the heinous murder, in a case that will test their ingenuity and their courage to the very limits.</p>
<p>The deeper they dig, the more twisted the trail to Constance's killer becomes—as the list of suspects grows longer by the minute. Was it her spurned and enraged medievalist lover, or a muckraking author who blamed her for ruining her life? Perhaps money was the motive, and Constance's sister, jealous of her wealth and fame, was responsible. Or possibly someone at Key News was angry enough—or frightened enough—to commit cold-blooded murder. The one sure thing is that Constance Young made a lot of enemies—and now one of them is Eliza's enemy as well. And the closer she and the Society get to unmasking the murderer, the closer they each get to dying, suddenly . . . and brutally.</p>"
9780060514334,"Never Forget: An Oral History Of September 11, 2001","['Mitchell Fink', 'Lois Mathias']","<p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, shock waves rippled through the country as the United States came under terrorist attack. In New York, Washington, D.C., and Somerset County, Pennsylvania, four planes piloted by members of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization left death, shattered innocence, and incomprehensible destruction in their wake. While the attacks united all Americans in their shared horror and grief, the actual witnesses to these events often bear the heaviest weight of these painful memories. <b>Never Forget</b> is a collection of unbelievably moving stories of loss, heartache, and survival, as told in the words of those closest to the unfolding tragedy.</p>
<p>In stark, haunting detail, these vivid personal accounts bring to life the events as they happened: from the harrowing moments after the planes hit the twin Towers of the World Trade Center to the overwhelming cloud of debris that enveloped lower Manhattan when the towers fell, the devastating conversations with loved ones on the hijacked flights, the terrifying hours spent trapped in the fallen buildings, and the painstaking recovery efforts at each site. Moses Lipson, an eighty-nine-year-old construction inspector, walks down from the eighty-eighth floor of Tower 1. Steven Bienkowski, a police officer in the New York Harbor Unit Scuba Team, watches helplessly from a helicopter as people trapped in the upper floors of Tower 1 reach from the windows to beg for a miracle rescue. Tim McGinn, a now-retired NYPD lieutenant, shoots out a window and saves at least thirty people from suffocation. Young Lyzbeth Glick's heart drops when she realizes that her husband, Jeremy, who changed his travel plans at the last moment, is now on the hijacked flight from Newark. As the Pentagon blazes, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Anderson plunges back inside to rescue civilians trapped by fallen debris.</p>
<p>Weeks later, the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero continue. Construction worker Joseph Bradley looks on as a firefighter gently closes the eyes and straightens the suit of a woman whose body is found in the rubble. Benjamin Garelick, seven years old, raises seven hundred dollars with a lemonade stand to ""help the firemen buy a new truck.""</p>
<p>As these unforgettable stories reveal, many Americans transcended their own confusion and despair to help one another escape, to offer one another kindness, and to affirm life in the face of catastrophe. This concert of voices shows, as never before, the heartbreaking grief and slow but uplifting healing process that the people of this nation have experienced individually and as one.</p>"

<p>Bust is a white–knuckled story of the highs and lows of a world–class gambler. Introduced to gambling at the age of six, Resnick was a whiz kid who was winning tens of thousands by his teens. A successful businessman, he won and lost millions at the gambling tables throughout his twenties–and wrote more than 130 bad checks to cover his losses. Resnick's high–rolling lifestyle opened the door to the parties 'n' celebrities universe of Las Vegas, while at the same time introducing him to the underbelly of bookies and mobsters. He was surrounded by a host of enablers who lent him cash–often at exorbitant rates that enriched their pockets at his expense. And, finally, he found what seemed like the answer to his prayers: An insider at a family–owned Chicago bank who gave him an open line of credit. It all came to a head one fateful morning when a phone call informed him that he had 24 hours to deposit $3,000,000 into a bank account. Cornered by sure financial ruin, a prison sentence, and worse, Resnick drove to a casino in Hammond, Indiana, with a million dollars in cash . . . won up to $8 million in one night . . . and then lost it all before he left the table. In one frenzied night–captured on casinovideotape–Resnick brought down that bank, and won himself a jail sentence for bank fraud.</p>
<p>Adam Resnick's story is both moving and timely. Coming when the multi–billion–dollar gambling industry is bigger than ever and celebrity poker tournaments are the rage, this stinging indictment of gambling's dark side and portrait of a lifelong addict will draw readers who want to know more about what it is to be a high roller–the risks, the exhilaration, and the eventual collapse</p>"

A year later, he became a sensation on Broadway with the premiere of <b>On the Town</b>. Throughout the 1950s, his Broadway fame only grew with <b>Wonderful Town</b>, <b>Candide</b>, and <b>West Side Story</b>. And in 1958, the Philharmonic appointed him the first American Music Director of a major symphony orchestra—a signal historical event. He was adored as a quintessential celebrity but one who could do it all—embracing both popular and classical music, a natural with the new medium of television, a born teacher, writer, and speaker, as well as a political and social activist. In 1976, having conducted the Philharmonic for more than one thousand concerts, he took his orchestra on tour to Europe for the last time.</p>
<p>All of this played out against the backdrop of post-Second World War New York City as it rose to become the cultural capital of the world—the center of wealth, entertainment, communications, and art—and continued through the chaotic and galvanizing movements of the 1960s that led to its precipitous decline by the mid 1970s.</p>
<p>The essays within this book do not simply retell the Bernstein story; instead, Leonard Bernstein's brother, Burton Bernstein, and current New York Philharmonic archivist and historian, Barbara B. Haws, have brought together a distinguished group of contributors to examine Leonard Bernstein's historic relationship with New York City and its celebrated orchestra. Composer John Adams, American historians Paul Boyer and Jonathan Rosenberg, music historians James Keller and Joseph Horowitz, conductor and radio commentator Bill McGlaughlin, musicologist Carol Oja, and music critics Tim Page and Alan Rich have written incisive essays, which are enhanced by personal reminiscences from Burton Bernstein. The result is a telling portrait of Leonard Bernstein, the musician and the man.</p>"

<p>In <i>We'll Always Have Paris</i>—a new collection of never-before-published stories—the inimitable Bradbury once again does what few writers have ever done as well.

He enchants us with the magic he mastered decades ago and still performs flawlessly. In these pages, radio voices become indomitable flesh and the dead arise to recapture life. There is joy in an eccentric old man's dance for the world and wonder over the workings of humankind's best friend, O Holy Dog.

She has a physician husband, two children, and a thriving psychiatric clinic. But her life is much more than that. She is one of the country's leading experts on serial killers, and has spent as many as four hundred hours alone in a room with depraved murderers, digging deep into killers' psyches in ways no profiler before ever has.</p><p>In <b>My Life Among the Serial Killers</b>, Dr. Morrison relates how she profiled the Mad Biter, Richard Otto Macek, who chewed on his victims' body parts, stalked Dr. Morrison, then believed she was his wife. She did the last interview with Ed Gein, who was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's <b>Psycho</b>. John Wayne Gacy, the clown-obsessed killer of young men, sent her crazed Christmas cards and gave her his paintings as presents.

She has also studied serial killers throughout history and shows how this is not a recent phenomenon with psychological autopsies of the fifteenth-century French war hero Gilles de Rais, the sixteenth-century Hungarian Countess Bathory, H. H. Holmes of the late ninteenth century, and Albert Fish of the Roaring Twenties.</p><p>Through it all, Dr. Morrison has been on a mission to discover the reasons why serial killers are compelled to murder, how they choose their victims, and what we can do to prevent their crimes in the future.

<li>Delegation, or getting other people to do the stuff you don't want to</li>
<li>Absence, or the ability to get ""work"" done while not being physically on the scene</li>
<li>Abuse of status</li>
<li>Acting visionary when confused</li>

9780060580537,"Nemesis: The True Story : Aristotle Onassis, Jackie O, And The Love Triangle That Brought Down The Kennedys","['Evans, Peter J. A.']","<p>Peter Evans's biography of Aristotle Onassis, <i>Ari</i>, met with great acclaim when it was published in 1986. Ari provided the world with an unprecedented glimpse of the Greek shipping magnate's orbit of dizzying wealth, twisted intrigues, and questionable mores. Not long after the book appeared, however, Onassis's daughter Christina and his longtime business partner Yannis Georgakis hinted to Evans that he had missed the ""real story"" -- one that proved Onassis's intrigues had deadly results. ""I must begin,""<br>
Georgakis said, ""with the premise that, for Onassis, Bobby Kennedy was unfinished business from way back...""</p>
<p>His words launched Evans into the heart of a story that tightly bound Onassis not to Jackie's first husband, but to his ambitious younger brother Bobby. A bitter rivalry emerged between Bobby and Ari long before Onassis and Jackie had even met. <i>Nemesis</i> reveals the tangled thread of events that linked two of the world's most powerful men in their intense hatred for one another and uncovers the surprising role played by the woman they both loved. Their power struggle unfolds against a heady backdrop of international intrigue: Bobby Kennedy's discovery of the Greek shipping magnate's shady dealings, which led him to bar Onassis from trade with the United States; Onassis's attempt to control much of Saudi Arabia's oil; Onassis's untimely love affair with Jackie's married sister Lee Radziwill; and his bold invitation to First Lady Jackie to join him on his yacht -- without the president. Just as the self-made Greek tycoon gloried in the chance to stir the wrath of the Kennedys, they struggled unsuccessfully to break his spell over the woman who held the key to all of their futures. After Jack's death, Bobby became ever closer to Camelot's holy widow, and fought to keep her from marrying his sworn rival. But Onassis rarely failed to get what he wanted, and Jackie became his wife shortly after Bobby was killed.</p>
<p>Through extensive interviews with the closest friends,<br>
lovers, and relatives of Onassis and the Kennedys, longtime journalist Evans has uncovered the shocking culmination of the Kennedy-Onassis-Kennedy love triangle: Aristotle Onassis was at the heart of the plot to kill Bobby Kennedy.<br>
Meticulously tracing Onassis's connections in the world of terrorism, <i>Nemesis</i> presents compelling evidence that he financed the assassination -- including a startling confession that has gone unreported for nearly three decades. Along the way, this groundbreaking work also daringly paints these international icons in all of their true colors. From Evans's deeply nuanced portraits of the charismatic Greek shipping magnate and his acquisitive iconic bride to his probing and revelatory look into the events that shaped an era, <i>Nemesis</i> is a work that will not be soon forgotten.</p>"

La intensa interacción entre las culturas sajona y latina, cuyo principal escenario-pero no el único-es el río Grande, proporciona material abundante para analizar las conductas de los diversos grupos étncos que conviven cotidianamente en los Estados Unidos. Las relaciones inequitativas de poder que por lo general producen los asiáticos y latinos son el tema de numerosas obras literarias y fílmicas a las que el autor recurre para tocar los distintos ángulos del tema central. Esta obra memorable es el resultado de una vida compartida en dos ámbitos culturales más que de un trabajo premeditado y regular de investigación, Stavans, a quien los medios de comunicación norteamericanos han descrito como ""un Alexis de Tocqueville moderno"" y ""un ensayista de la más fina calidad intelectual en la línea de Edmund Wilson y Octavio Paz"".</p>
<p>Ilán Stavans nació en México, en 1961. Cursó estudios de posgrado en la Universidad de Columbia, y ahora tiene la cátedra Lewis-Sebring de cultura latina y latinoamericana en Amherst College.

9780060199210,Racing The Antelope: What Animals Can Teach Us About Running And Life,['Bernd Heinrich'],"<p>Racing the Antelope</p>
<blockquote><b>""The human experience is populated by dreams and aspirations. For me, the animal totem of these dreams is the antelope, swift, strong, and elusive. we chase after 'antelope,' and sometimes we catch them. Often we don't. But why do we bother? I think it is because without dream 'antelopes' to chase we become what a lapdog is to a wolf. And we are inherently more like wolves than lapdogs, because the communal chase is part of our biological makeup.""</b></blockquote>
<p>In 1981, Bernd Heinrich, a lifelong runner, decided to test his limits at age forty-one and race in the North American 100-Kilometer Championship race in Chicago. To improve his own preparations as a runner, he wondered what he could learn from other animals—what makes us different and how we are the same—and what new perspective these lessons could shed on human evolution. A biologist and award-winning nature writer, he considered the flight endurance of insects and birds, the antelope's running prowess and limitations, the ultraendurance of the camel, and the remarkable sprinting and jumping skills of frogs. Exploring how biological adaptations have granted these creatures ""superhuman"" abilities, he looked at how human physiology can or cannot replicate these adaptations. Drawing on his observations and knowledge of animal physiology and behavior, Heinrich ran the race, and the results surprised everyone—himself most of all.</p>
<p>In <b>Racing the Antelope,</b> Heinrich applies his characteristic blend of scientific inquiry and philosophical musing to a deft exploration of the human desire—even need—to run. His rich prose reveals what endurance athletes can learn about the body and the spirit from other athletes in the animal kingdom. He then takes you into the heart of his own grueling 100-kilometer ultramarathon, where he puts into practice all that he has discovered about the physical, spiritual—and primal—drive to win.</p>
<p>At once lyrical and scientific, <b>Racing the Antelope</b> melds a unique blend of biology, anthropology, psychology, and philosophy with Heinrich's passion for running to discover how and why we run.</p>"

You'd have something from every major food group, run around the playground for a while, and you looked and felt fine. But today it's not so simple.

9780060525354,The Canterbury Papers: A Novel Of Suspense,['Judith Koll Healey'],"<p>Set in lavishly described medieval England and France, <b>The Canterbury Papers</b> is an enthralling and suspenseful debut novel combining dark family secrets, duplicity, and a missing heir to the throne.</p>
<p>The wily Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of France and then of England, sends her former ward, Alaïs, the sister of the king of France, to retrieve a cache of letters hidden in Canterbury Cathedral. Letters that, in the wrong hands, could bring down the English king. In return, Eleanor promises to reveal a long-held and dangerous secret involving Alaïs — a bargain the French princess is powerless to resist.</p>
<p>Within the fortnight the letters would be delivered to Fontrevault Abbey. Then Eleanor would be happy, and I would finally get the information she had promised.</p>
<p>So engaged was I in the arduous task of rising that I failed to hear the slight sound behind me that would have signaled my fate. Instead I was taken completely by surprise. The only thing I felt was a strong hand around my neck, another around my waist, and — before I could cry out — I smelled the thick, sweet scent of a mandrake-soaked cloth. Unforgiving hands clapped it against my face, and all went dark.</p>
<p>Before Alaïs can complete her mission, she is abducted, an event that sets in motion a dangerous plot. It will require all of Alaïs's considerable strengths, along with help from the very intriguing leader of the Knights Templar, to unravel dark secrets, unmask evil villains, and escape with her life.</p>

9780060198206,Rope Burns: Stories From The Corner,['F. X. Toole'],"<p>Seventy-year-old F.X. Toole has exploded onto the literary scene with this astonishing first collection of stories drawn from his own experiences in boxing. In these powerful and moving tales, he reveals a complex web of athletes, trainers, and promoters and their extended families, all players in an unforgiving business where victory, like defeat, comes at a dark and painful price.</p>
<p>F. X. Toole breathes life into vivid, compelling characters who radiate the fierce intensity of the worlds they inhabit. In ""The Monkey Look,"" an aging cut man with an incorrigible sweet tooth works the corner for Hoolie, a featherweight ""bleeder"" with attitude. ""Black Jew"" brings Reggie Valentine Love and his camp to a brutal elimination bout in Atlantic City, where they are treated like second-class citizens by a promoter. In ""Million $$$ Baby,"" seasoned trainer Frankie Dunn faces the most daunting challenge of his life when he agrees to aid the fearless Maggie Fitzgerald in her quest to become a champion boxer. ""Fightin' in Philly"" and ""Frozen Water"" are stories in which youthful dreams of glory and celebrity are threatened by the harsh realities that suffuse both of these narratives. The novella ""Rope Burns"" is the crowning achievement of the collection, offering a gritty, heartrending account of the indestructible bond that develops between a devoted fighter and his trainer.</p>
<p>In <b>Rope Burns</b> F.X. bole exhibits the skill of a miniaturist: in precise and exquisite detail, he peoples a world rich in unforgettable characters, like Señora Cabrera, the owner of the Acapulco café, who makes low-fat refried beans to keep a local fighter in top form, and an anonymous museum guard with a soft spot for Michelangelo. Toole's faithful dialogue crackles and bites, and the flawed characters he creates cannot help but remind us of our own too fragile humanity. He brings a new understanding to the violence and purity of the sweet science and the world it engenders, opening a window into the fighter's soul that can never he closed.</p>"

In fact, recent research has shown that this vision bears little relation to reality.</p>
<p>The field of archaeology has changed dramatically in the past two decades, as women have challenged their male colleagues' exclusive focus on hard artifacts such as spear points rather than tougher to find evidence of women's work. J. M. Adovasio and Olga Soffer are two of the world's leading experts on perishable artifacts such as basketry, cordage, and weaving. In <b>The Invisible Sex</b>, the authors present an exciting new look at prehistory, arguing that women invented all kinds of critical materials, including the clothing necessary for life in colder climates, the ropes used to make rafts that enabled long-distance travel by water, and nets used for communal hunting. Even more important, women played a central role in the development of language and social life—in short, in our becoming human.

9780060731571,Crazy Bosses: Fully Revised And Updated,['Stanley Bing'],"<p>Since the latter part of the century just past, Stanley Bing has been exploring the relationship between authority and madness. In one bestselling book after another, reporting from his hot-seat as an insider in a world-renowned multinational corporation, he has tried to understand the inner workings of those who lead us and to inquire why they seem to be powered, much of the time, by demons that make them obnoxious and dangerous, even to themselves.</p>
<p>In <b>What Would Machiavelli Do?</b>, Bing looked at the issue of why mean people do better than nice people, and found that in their particular form of insanity lay incredible power. In <b>Throwing the Elephant: Zen and the Art of Managing Up</b>, he offered a spiritual path toward managing the unruly executive beast. And in <b>Sun Tzu Was a Sissy</b>, he taught us how to become one of them, and wage war on the playing field that ends in a dream home in Cabo. Now he returns to his roots to offer the last word on the entity that shapes our lives and stomps through—and on—our dreams: The Crazy Boss.</p>
<p>Students of Bing—and there are many, secreted inside tortured organizations, yearning for blunt instruments with which to fight—will note that he has walked this ground before, looking for answers. In 1992, he published the first edition of <b>Crazy Bosses</b>, which was fine, as far as it went. Now, some 15 years and several dozen insane bosses later, he has updated and rethought much of the work. Back in the last century, Bing was a small, trembling creature, looking up at those who made his life miserable and analyzing the mental illness that gave them their power. Today, while still trembling much of the time, he is in fact one of those people his prior work has warned us against. His own hard-won wisdom and now institutionalized dementia make this new edition completely fresh and indispensable to anyone who works for somebody else or lives with somebody else, or would like to.</p>
<p>In short, Bing is back on his home turf in this funny, true, and essential book, peering with his keen and frosty eye at the crazy boss in all his guises: the Bully, the Paranoid, the Narcissist, the Wimp, and the self-destructive Disaster Hunter. If you loved the original, classic <b>Crazy Bosses</b>, you'll be thrilled to plunge back into the new, refurbished pool. If you are new to the book, strap yourself in: it's going to be a crazy ride.</p>


                        <p>Drawing on hundreds of no-holds-barred interviews, the renowned ""Executive Summary"" columnist for Esquire dissects the mentality of the workplace--and comes up with solid strategies for those who work under the constant battle siege of the difficult boss.

9780061845246,Up all night: my life and times in rock radio,"['Miller, Carol , 1950-']","<p>The all-American chronicle of radio legend Carol Miller, from her rise to success in a male dominated world, to the rockstars she's know along the way, to, for the first time, the private story of her quietly waged battle with a deadly disease.</p>
<p>As one of the nation's top radio DJs, Carol Miller introduced the music of Bruce Springsteen to the New York airwaves, was on a first-name basis with Sir Paul McCartney, dated Steven Tyler, and has been recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her on-air approach and singular voice have influenced the sound of rock radio for more than four decades, and her satellite and syndicated <b>Get the Led Out</b> programs are heard nationwide.</p>
<p>In <b>Up All Night</b>, Carol spins the entertaining, moving, and revealing story of her life and times in rock radio and beyond. A nice Jewish girl from Queens, Carol was supposed to be a doctor or, at the very least, a lawyer. But hearing a doo-wop trio in the alley under her window changed the direction of her life forever: she fell in love with popular music.</p>
<p>As the tumult and excitement of the sixties rocked colleges across America, Carol—a biology major at the University of Pennsylvania—became an underground rock DJ at the campus radio station. Radio jobs in Philadelphia and New York City quickly followed, and Carol rose to the top of the profession. But even as she enjoyed a professional and personal life imbued with rock and roll glamour, Carol harbored guilt, disappointment, and alienation, believing she'd failed her traditional, intellectual Jewish parents and often feeling like an outsider in the very culture she had helped to create. The specter of an unnamed illness that had claimed many of her relatives' lives hung over hers as well, and she too would face a monumental challenge when diagnosed with breast and uterine cancer. Told in the distinctive voice that has charmed millions of listeners for decades, <b>Up All Night</b> is a frank, funny, and inspiring memoir. Offering snapshots of the rarefied world of pop music and the shifting social history of our times, it is as much a cultural chronicle as it is one woman's candid and moving story.</p>"

<p>In today's world, women have more power, legal recognition, and professional success than ever before. Alongside the evident progress of the women's movement, however, writer and journalist Naomi Wolf is troubled by a different kind of social control, which, she argues, may prove just as restrictive as the traditional image of homemaker and wife. It's the beauty myth, an obsession with physical perfection that traps the modern woman in an endless spiral of hope, self-consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society's impossible definition of ""the flawless beauty.""</p>


                        <p>In this controversial national bestseller, feminist scholar Naomi Wolf argues that there is one hurdle in the struggle for equality that women have yet to clear--the myth of female beauty.

Because of the rapid changes in American society, Abraham Lincoln became president of a divided United States during a period of technological and social revolution. Among the many modern marvels that gave the North an advantage was the telegraph, which Lincoln used to stay connected to the forces in the field in almost real time.</p><p>No leader in history had ever possessed such a powerful tool to gain control over a fractious situation. An eager student of technology, Lincoln (the only president to hold a patent) had to learn to use the power of electronic messages. Without precedent to guide him, Lincoln began by reading the telegraph traffic among his generals. Then he used the telegraph to supplement his preferred form of communication-meetings and letters. He did not replace those face-to-face interactions. Through this experience, Lincoln crafted the best way to guide, reprimand, praise, reward, and encourage his commanders in the field.</p><p><b>Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails</b> tells a big story within a small compass. By paying close attention to Lincoln's lightning messages, we see a great leader adapt to a new medium. No reader of this work of history will be able to miss the contemporary parallels.

A legend in his own time, <b>Variety</b> called him ""America's greatest one-man stage draw."" Here was a man whose flair for showmanship went hand in hand with a fierce intellect; a man whose shaky moral compass and staggering conceit collided at all turns with an unrivaled eloquence and an overwhelming compassion for humanity.</p>
<p>Darrow had been one of the most revered lawyers in the country, but in 1924 his reputation was still clouded after a narrow escape from a charge of jury tampering in Los Angeles. At the age of sixty-seven he thought his life and career were almost over, until he was offered an impossible assignment—the defense of the teenage ""thrill killers"" Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. Darrow then went on to earn even more international acclaim in two other groundbreaking cases: a classic standoff against William Jennings Bryan in the Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee, and the Ossian Sweet murder trial in Detroit. Throughout two crammed and dizzying years, this lion of the court held the Western world in awe as he tackled these three starkly different, history-making cases, each in turn dubbed ""the Trial of the Century.""</p>
<p>But these trials, as important as they were to Darrow, were not the only events that helped rejuvenate him and seal his courtroom legacy. There was also his enduring relationship with Mary Field Parton, his lover and soul mate, a woman whose role toward the end of his career was larger than many have realized. With fascinating new research and discoveries, including her private journals and letters, <b>The Last Trials of Clarence Darrow</b> is an intimate and riveting depiction of this American icon, one of the greatest lawyers this country has ever seen.</p>"

9780061700194,Morning of Fire: America's Epic First Journey into the Pacific,['Scott Ridley'],"<p>The Forgotten True Story of Americaâs Daring First Exploration of the Pacific</p><p>Just four years after the Revolutionary War and more than a decade before Lewis and Clarkâs expedition, a remarkable-but now forgotten-plan was hatched along the docks of Boston Harbor. Two ships carrying the flag of the newly formed United States would be dispatched in 1787 on a landmark adventure around South Americaâs Cape Horn and into the largely uncharted waters of the Pacific Ocean, far past the western edge of the continent. The man chosen to lead the expedition was Captain John Kendrick, a master navigator who had made his name as a charismatic privateer during the Revolution. On the harrowing seven-year voyage that followed, Kendrick would establish the first American outpost in the remote Pacific Northwest, sail into a deadly cauldron of intertribal war in the Hawaiian Islands, wage a single-ship campaign to hold off advances of the British and Spanish empires, and narrowly escape capture by samurai in Japan before meeting his own violent and tragic end thousands of miles from home. Brilliantly brought to life by historian Scott Ridley, Morning of Fire is a startling rediscovery of a thrilling lost chapter of American history.</p>"

9780060194772,Deadly Departure: Why The Experts Failed To Prevent The Twa Flight 800 Disaster And How It Could Happen Again,['Christine Negroni'],"<p>The in-flight explosion of TWA Flight 800 on July 17, 1996, was one of the deadliest disasters in American history, spurring the most expensive airline investigation ever undertaken by the U.S. government. To this day the crash remains clouded in doubt and shadowed by suspicion of a government conspiracy.</p>
<p>If there was any conspiracy to hide the truth about what really happened to Flight 800, it began long before the crash. Past crashes tell the story: What happened on Flight 800 has happened before and will again, unless drastic changes are made. Now veteran journalist Christine Negroni reveals what the commercial aviation industry has known for more than thirty-five years that during flight confined vapors in the fuel tanks can create a bomb like environment. It takes only a small energy source to ignite it.</p>
<p>TWA Flight 800 was the fourteenth fuel tank explosion on a commercial airliner in thirty-five years. Yet each and every time, the airline industry persuaded regulators to deal with the symptoms of the problem and ignore the cause. When investigators could not immediately determine what happened, they were finally forced to look at the bigger picture. And, for the first time, this book exposes the hubris of aircraft manufacturers who knew all along, but dismissed as acceptable, the risk of fuel tank explosions.</p>
<p><b>Deadly Departure</b> shines a spotlight on the chaos behind the most massive crash investigation ever conducted, how the White House had to intervene between feuding investigators, and the surprising stories behind the missile theory conspiracies. It also tells the stories of the passengers and their families, the people of TWA and Boeing, the rescue and crisis workers, and the investigators and scientists involved illustrating the devastating effects on human lives. An impeccably researched, eye-opening examination of one of the great disasters of our time, <b>Deadly Departure</b> is a stunning exposé of how industry pressure continues to undermine regulatory policy, placing air travelers' lives at risk.</p>"

9780060641955,The Inner Eye Of Love: Mysticism And Religion,"['Johnston, William , 1925-2010']","<p>The Inner Eye of Love offers a contemporary theology of mysticism that locates it at the very center of authentic religious experience. It provides as well a practical guide for meditation even as it maps out the oceanic experience toward which meditation points. Johnston begins with the mystical tradition itself, its roots and origins, its appearance and significance in the Gospels, the letters of Paul, and the early Church. He explains what mysticism is and is not, and how it is inextricably bound up with love. It is at the level of mysticism, he maintains, that the two traditions of East and West can at last understand one another and begin to work together to heal a broken world. The Inner Eye of Love escorts the reader through the stages of the mystical journey, from initial call to final enlightenment. Johnston compares and contrasts the Oriental and Christian experience, continually revealing new points of commonality The much discussed dark night of the soulis seen here in a positive way, as an emptying preliminary to the overbrimming of the soul with the knowledge and love of God. Finally, the author considers the often misunderstood relation between mysticism and practical action.</p>"

As Suzanne Simons reveals in this first-ever inside look, based on extraordinary access to Blackwater founder Erik Prince, and dozens of his key employees, Blackwater is just the tip of Erik Prince's empire. He publicly reassures everyone that Blackwater only works for the U.S., and would never become a mercenary organization for other governments, yet he has another entire company dedicated to doing just that, hiring foreign nationals, working for well over a dozen different governments, and overlapping in crucial ways with Blackwater. In addition, he has a private spying company, run by former top CIA men, employing extraordinarily sensitive methods and technical sophistication, for rent by any interested party, from companies to governments. Finally, he is amassing an air fleet that is large enough to serve as a miniature air force, not just by purchasing planes and helicopters, but also by building his own unmanned drones. In short, the full story of Erik Prince and his now-crumbling empire is a story of one of the modern world's most influential military figures, and it has never been told. Prince is a man who shuns publicity except when absolutely necessary, to tamp down a scandal; even when he has wanted to tell his story, he has been shut down by his clients inWashington who won't stand for it. Instead, he has given Suzanne Simons hours of interviews; access to his staff; invitations to join him on trips to Afghanistan; and more. He is a fascinating figure, part deeply conservative, evangelical patriot; part rebellious, go-it-alone kingpin. He is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and his companies are worth billions. His empire dwarfs all of its competitors, to such a degree that even if the military wanted to wash its hands of him, they wouldn't be able to replace him.</p>"

9780061579271,Adam and Eve,['Sena Jeter Naslund'],"<p>The New York Times bestselling author of Ahab's Wife, Four Spirits, and Abundance returns with an audacious and provocative novel that envisions a world where science and faith contend for the allegiance of a new Adam &amp; Eve Her books have been hailed as exceptional (People); enchanting (Entertainment Weekly); of great cultural and historical importance (New York Times Book Review); and original and affecting (Los Angeles Times). One of the most imaginative and inspired writers of our time, Sena Jeter Naslund masterfully uses her craft to lay bare the poignant complexity of human-ity---the passion and despair, the ignorance and frailty, the genius and resilience that define us. From Victorian London to civil-rights-era Alabama, from nineteenth-century New England to revolutionary Paris, her novels offer profound insight and startling truths about human experience. Now, with Adam &amp; Eve, she delivers her most ambitious and encompassing tale to date. Hours before his untimely---and highly suspicious---death, world-renowned astrophysicist Thom Bergmann shares his discovery of extraterrestrial life with his wife, Lucy. Feeling that the warring world is not ready to learn of---or accept---proof of life elsewhere in the universe, Thom entrusts Lucy with his computer flash drive, which holds the keys to his secret work. Devastated by Thom's death, Lucy keeps the secret, but Thom's friend, anthropologist Pierre Saad, contacts Lucy with an unusual and dangerous request about another sensitive matter. Pierre needs Lucy to help him smuggle a newly discovered artifact out of Egypt: an ancient codex concerning the human authorship of the Book of Genesis. Offering a reinterpretation of the creation story, the document is sure to threaten the foundation of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions ... and there are those who will stop at nothing to suppress it. Midway through the daring journey, Lucy's small plane goes down on a slip of verdant land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Middle East. Burned in the crash landing, she is rescued by Adam, a delusional American soldier whose search for both spiritual and carnal knowledge has led to madness. Blessed with youth, beauty, and an unsettling innocence, Adam gently tends to Lucy's wounds, and in this quiet, solitary paradise, a bond between the unlikely pair grows. Ultimately, Lucy and Adam forsake their half-mythical Eden and make their way back toward civilization, where memebers of an ultraconservative religious cult are determined to deprive the world of the knowledge Lucy carries. Set against the searing debate between evolutionists and creationists, Adam &amp; Eve expands the definition of a sacred book, and suggests that true madness lies in wars and violence fueled by all religious literalism and intolerance. A thriller, a romance, an adventure, and an idyll, Adam &amp; Eve is a tour de force by a master contemporary storyteller.</p>"

But that simple catch-phrase, embraced by the millions--and the millions--of The Rock's fans, can't begin to capture the spirit and larger-than-life personality of the most electrifying man in sports-entertainment.""</p>
<p>In this action-packed, revealing and outrageously funny memoir, World Wrestling Federation Superstar The Rock recounts his life in and out of the ring with unapologetic honesty and inimitable style. From his boyhood days traveling around the world with his father professional wrestler Rocky Johnson to his years as a football player at the University of Miami to his meteoric rise through the ranks of the Federation, <i>The Rock Says</i> chronicles in vivid detail the life story of one of sports-entertainment's most innovative and best-loved personalities.</p>
<p>The Rock recalls his injury-plagued career at Miami and a subsequent foray to the Great White North, where he discovered that in Canada being a professional football player is not exactly a glamorous life. After a few months of sleeping on putrid, stained mattresses that he dug out of the garbage and subsisting on nothing but plain spaghetti, ""D.J."" ditched his cleats forever and set his sights on the path of his father and grandfather--wrestling.</p>
<p>Performing first in the minors as plain old Dwayne Johnson, then as ""Flex Kavana"" and later as ""Rocky Maivia,"" he quickly became one of the World Wrestling Federation's hopefuls. But no matter how he tried to get over with the fans, the stadiums greeted him with chants of ""Rocky sucks! Rocky sucks!"" He then adopted the brash persona of The Rock--a snorting, spitting, snotting, swearing son-of-a-bitch with the soul of a smart-ass comic and the body of an Adonis--and he found his true calling as the ""People's Champion.""</p>
<p>The Rock will take fans on a guided tour of big-time professional wrestling, a highly competitive business in which a handful of gifted and lucky performers dominate, and all others dream of a moment in the spotlight. He provides a breathtaking, minute-by-minute account of Wrestle Mania, the Super Bowl of pro wrestling, including an intimate backstage look at rehearsals with his opponent, Stone Cold Steve Austin. And he discusses in heartfelt detail the loss of his friend and co-worker, Owen Hart.</p>
<p>Filled with genuinely touching stories of love and strife, hilarious anecdotes, inside accounts of an industry whose machinations have long been shrouded in secrecy and dozens of previously unpublished photographs from The Rock's personal collection, <i>The Rock Says</i> is--as The Rock himself might put it--""the coolest thing since the other side of the pillow if you smell what The Rock is cookin'.""</p>"

9780061730740,Heart And Soul: The Story Of America And African Americans (coretta Scott King Award - Author Winner Title(s)),['Kadir Nelson'],"<p>The story of America and African Americans is a story of hope and inspiration and unwavering courage. But it is also the story of injustice; of a country divided by law, education, and wealth; of a people whose struggles and achievements helped define their country. This is the story of the men, women, and children who toiled in the hot sun picking cotton for their masters; it’s about the America ripped in two by Jim Crow laws; it’s about the brothers and sisters of all colors who rallied against those who would dare bar a child from an education. It’s a story of discrimination and broken promises, determination and triumphs.</p>
<p>Kadir Nelson, one of this generation’s most accomplished, award-winning artists, has created an epic yet intimate introduction to the history of America and African Americans, from colonial days through the civil rights movement. Written in the voice of an “Everywoman,” an unnamed narrator whose forebears came to this country on slave ships and who lived to cast her vote for the first African American president, heart and soul touches on some of the great transformative events and small victories of that history. This inspiring book demonstrates that in gaining their freedom and equal rights, African Americans helped our country achieve its promise of liberty and justice—the true heart and soul of our nation.</p>

9780060929961,The Ten Commandments: The Significance Of God's Laws In Everyday Life,"['Laura Schlessinger', 'Stewart Vogel']","<p>The Ten Commandments are the first direct communication between a people and God. Designed to elevate our lives above mere frantic, animal existence to the sublime levels humanity is capable or experiencing, they are the blueprint of God's expectations of us and His plan for a meaningful, just, loving, and holy life.

9780060531089,Warped Passages: Unraveling The Mysteries Of The Universe's Hidden Dimensions,['Lisa Randall'],"<p>The universe has its secrets. It may even hide extra dimensions, different from anything ever imagined. A whole raft of remarkable conceptsnow rides atop the scientific firmament, including parallel universes, warped geometry, and threedimensional sink-holes. We understand far more about the world than we did just a few short years ago — and yet we are more uncertain about the true nature of the universe than ever before. Have wereached a point of scientific discovery so advanced that the laws of physics as we know them are simply not sufficient? Will we all soon have to acceptexplanations that previously remained in the realm of science fiction?</p>
<p>Lisa Randall is herself making these extraordinary breakthroughs, pushing back the boundaries of science in her research to answer some of the most fundamental questions posed by Nature. For example, why is the gravitational field from the entire Earth so defenseless against the small tug of a tiny magnet? Searching for answers to such seemingly irresolvable questions has led physicists to postulate extra dimensions, the presence of which may lead to unimaginable gains in scientific understanding. Randall takes us into the incredible world of warped, hidden dimensions that underpin the universe we live in, describing how we might prove their existence, while examining the questions that they still leave unanswered.</p>
<p><b>Warped Passages</b> provides an exhilarating overview that tracks the arc of discovery from early twentieth-century physics to the razor's edge of today's particle physics and string theory, unweaving the current debates about relativity, quantum mechanics, and gravity. In a highly readable style sure to entertain and elucidate, Lisa Randall demystifies the science and beguilingly unravels the mysteries of the myriad worlds that may exist just beyond the one we are only now beginning to know.</p>


                        <p>Randall, a professor of physics at Harvard, offers a tour of current questions in particle physics, string theory, and cosmology, paying particular attention to the thesis that more physical dimensions exist than are usually acknowledged. Writing for a general audience, Randall is patient and kind: she encourages readers to skip around in the text, corrals mathematical equations in an appendix at the back, and starts off each chapter with an allegorical story, in a manner recalling the work of George Gamow. Although the subject itself is intractably difficult to follow, the exuberance of Randall’s narration is appealing. She’s honest about the limits of the known, and almost revels in the uncertainties that underlie her work—including the possibility that some day it may all be proved wrong.

9780061353208,The Making Of Second Life: Notes From The New World,['Wagner James Au'],"<p>The wholly virtual world known as Second Life has attracted more than a million active users, millions of dollars, and created its own—very real—economy.</p>
<p><b>The Making of Second Life</b> is the behind-the-scenes story of the Web 2.0 revolution's most improbable enterprise: the creation of a virtual 3-D world with its own industries, culture, and social systems. Now the toast of the Internet economy, and the subject of countless news articles, profiles, and television shows, Second Life is usually known for the wealth of real-world companies (Reuters, Pontiac, IBM) that have created ""virtual offices"" within it, and the number of users (""avatars"") who have become wealthy through their user-created content.</p>
<p>What sets Second Life apart from other online worlds, and what has made it such a success (one million-plus monthly users and growing) is its simple user-centered philosophy. Instead of attempting to control the activities of those who enter it, the creators of Second Life turned them loose: users (also known as Residents) own the rights to the intellectual content they create in-world, and the in-world currency of Linden Dollars is freely exchangeable for U.S. currency. Residents have responded by generating millions of dollars of economic activity through their in-world designs and purchases—currently, the Second Life economy averages more than one million U.S. dollars in transactions every day, while dozens of real-world companies and projects have evolved and developed around content originated in Second Life.</p>
<p>Wagner James Au explores the long, implausible road behind that success, and looks at the road ahead, where many believe that user-created worlds like Second Life will become the Net's next generation and the fulcrum for a revolution in the way we shop, work, and interact. Au's story is narrated from both within the corporate offices of Linden Lab, Second Life's creator, and from within Second Life itself, revealing all the fascinating, outrageous, brilliant, and aggravating personalities who make Second Life a very real place-and an illuminating mirror on the real (physical) world. Au writes about the wars they fought (sometimes literally), the transformations they underwent, the empires of land and commerce they developed, and above all, the collaborative creativity that makes their society an imperfect utopia, better in some ways than the one beyond their computer screens.</p>"

<p>In 132 years of derby races, only 11 horses have won the Triple Crown, the last in 1978. Barbaro was a favorite to be the twelfth until May 20, 2006, at the Preakness Stakes, when his jockey, Edgar Prado pulled him up a couple of hundred yards from the starting gate. Subsequent examination revealed that he had virtually exploded bones in his right rear leg so badly that under normal conditions he would have been euthanized right on the track. But his owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, chose another path, one filled with anxiety and tears—but also courageous determination to save his life.</p>
<p>This touching, soaring book—filled with insights from Barbaro's trainers, breeders, caretakers, and owners—follows Barbaro from foal to colt to champion to perfect patient. But In the end it is not just a story of a down-but-not-out champion, but of human beings at their very best.</p>"

Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, and William Slaone Coffin.

9780060585440,"Sex With Kings: 500 Years Of Adultery, Power, Rivalry, And Revenge",['Eleanor Herman'],"<p>Throughout the centuries, royal mistresses have been worshiped, feared, envied, and reviled. They set the fashions, encouraged the arts, and, in some cases, ruled nations. Eleanor Herman's <b>Sex with Kings</b> takes us into the throne rooms and bedrooms of Europe's most powerful monarchs. Alive with flamboyant characters, outrageous humor, and stirring poignancy, this glittering tale of passion and politics chronicles five hundred years of scintillating women and the kings who loved them.</p>
<p>Curiously, the main function of a royal mistress was not to provide the king with sex but with companionship. Forced to marry repulsive foreign princesses, kings sought solace with women of their own choice. And what women they were! From Madame de Pompadour, the famous mistress of Louis XV, who kept her position for nineteen years despite her frigidity, to modern-day Camilla Parker-Bowles, who usurped none other than the glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>The successful royal mistress made herself irreplaceable. She was ready to converse gaily with him when she was tired, make love until all hours when she was ill, and cater to his every whim. Wearing a mask of beaming delight over any and all discomforts, she was never to be exhausted, complaining, or grief-stricken.</p>
<p>True, financial rewards for services rendered were of royal proportions — some royal mistresses earned up to $200 million in titles, pensions, jewels, and palaces. Some kings allowed their mistresses to exercise unlimited political power. But for all its grandeur, a royal court was a scorpion's nest of insatiable greed, unquenchable lust, and vicious ambition. Hundreds of beautiful women vied to unseat the royal mistress. Many would suffer the slings and arrows of negative public opinion, some met with tragic ends and were pensioned off to make room for younger women. But the royal mistress often had the last laugh, as she lived well and richly off the fruits of her ""sins.""</p>
<p>From the dawn of time, power has been a mighty aphrodisiac. With diaries, personal letters, and diplomatic dispatches, Eleanor Herman's trailblazing research reveals the dynamics of sex and power, rivalry and revenge, at the most brilliant courts of Europe. Wickedly witty and endlessly entertaining, <b>Sex with Kings</b> is a chapter of women's history that has remained unwritten — until now.</p>"

9780060590048,Tyrants: The World's 20 Worst Living Dictators,['David Wallechinsky'],"<p>Today more than ever, international headlines are dominated by dispatches from the many dictatorships that still dot the globe. Although Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has been deposed, North Korea's Kim Jong-il continues to attract attention on the world stage; at the same time, other dictatorships, led by royal families, military juntas, and single political parties, persist in repressing and brutalizing their citizens without ever attracting anything like Saddam's or Kim Jong-il's level of international attention.</p>
<p>In this fascinating, eye-opening read, <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author David Wallechinsky offers in-depth portraits of each of the twenty worst dictators — and the governments they head — currently in power: exposing their crimes, and revealing their strange personalities and mysterious backgrounds. <b>Tyrants</b> also reveals the extent that foreign corporations and governments support these tyrants despite their policies.</p>

9780060888404,Shopportunity!: How To Be A Retail Revolutionary,['Kate Newlin'],"<p>Today's shopping culture is turning the shopper into a zombie—and the thrill of the hunt into the robotic management of inventory. We are in danger of losing a resonant personal ritual, replaced by the boring habitual. For millions of us, the sizzle of a daily shopping experience has devolved into a relentless acquisition of the okay, available, and cheap. Why are we willing to pay $3.50 for a latte at Starbucks, but bristle at a 10-cent increase in the price of toothpaste? Why do we drive miles out of our way to buy a bag of 100 razor blades for 50 cents less than at our local store, and then spend $3.99 on a tub of pretzels that we don't need? We're wasting our time and money at the cost of our patience and good will.</p>
<p>In <b>Shopportunity!</b>—a manifesto-cum-exposé—marketing expert Kate Newlin looks behind the aisles of our best-known retailers to reveal that the dopamine rush of getting a good deal is confusing shoppers' wants with their needs. Packed with perceptive reporting, <b>Shopportunity!</b> provides an insider's view of how marketers create a brand and the overwhelming power of retailers to interfere with the transformational joys that great brands bring to our daily lives. It is time for shoppers to revolutionize their shopping experience and take the power away from retailers.</p>
<p>One generation of marketers has hooked three generations on the addiction of price promotion, and it has wreaked havoc on our waistlines, credit ratings, and life experience. From Wal-Mart to Macy's, Ralph Lauren, Whole Foods, and the Home Shopping Network, Newlin reveals what the world's leading retailers really know about us, and what it takes to kick the addiction to getting the best deal possible. Culminating in a Shopper's Bill of Rights, <b>Shopportunity!</b> will liberate shoppers—as well as the manufacturers and retailers who serve them—from the tyranny of the cheap.</p>"

They are the uninvited guests in our lives. When tragedy or hardship hits, they may become our constant companions.</p>
<p>Anxiety can wash over us like a tidal wave or operate as a silent thrum under the surface of our daily lives. With stories that are sometimes hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking, Lerner takes us from ""fear lite"" to the most difficult lessons the universe sends us. We learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>how a man was ""cured in a day"" of the fear of rejection — and what we can learn from his story</li>
<li>how the author overcame her dread of public speaking when her worst fears were realized</li>
<li>how to deal with the fear of not being good enough, and with the shame of feeling essentially flawed and inadequate</li>
<li>how to stay calm and clear in an anxious, crazy workplace</li>
<li>how to manage fear and despair when life sends a crash course in illness, vulnerability, and loss</li>
<li>how ""positive thinking"" helps — and harms</li>
<li>how to be our best and bravest selves, even when we are terrified and have internalized the shaming messages of others</li>
</ul>
<p>No one signs up for anxiety, fear, and shame, but we can’t avoid them either. As we learn to respond to these three key emotions in new ways, we can live more fully in the present and move into the future with courage, clarity, humor, and hope. <b>Fear and Other Uninvited Guests</b> shows us how.</p>"

<p>Women today have more choices than at any time in history, yet many smart, ambitious, contemporary women are finding themselves angry, dissatisfied, stressed out. Why are they dissatisfied? And what do they really want? These questions form the premise of this passionate, provocative, funny, searingly honest collection of original essays in which twenty-six women writers—ranging in age from twenty-four to sixty-five, single and childless or married with children or four times divorced—invite readers into their lives, minds, and bedrooms to talk about the choices they’ve made, what’s working, and what’s not.</p>
<p>With wit and humor, in prose as poetic and powerful as it is blunt and dead-on, these intriguing women offer details of their lives that they’ve never publicly revealed before, candidly sounding off on:</p>
<p>• The difficult decisions and compromises of living with lovers, marrying, staying single and having children</p>
<p>• The perpetual tug of war between love and work, family and career</p>
<p>• The struggle to simultaneously care for ailing parents and a young family</p>
<p>• The myth of co-parenting</p>
<p>• Dealing with helpless mates and needy toddlers</p>
<p>• The constrictions of traditional women’s roles as well as the cliches of feminism</p>
<p>• Anger at laid-back live-in lovers content to live off a hardworking woman’s checkbook</p>
<p>• Anger at being criticized for one’s weight</p>
<p>• Anger directed at their mothers, right and wrong</p>
<p>• And–well–more anger...</p>
<p>“This book was born out of anger,” begins Cathi Hanauer, but the end result is an intimate sharing of experience that will move, amuse, and enlighten. The Bitch in the House is a perfect companion for your students as they plot a course through the many voices of modern feminism. This is the sound of the collective voice of successful women today-in all their anger, grace, and glory.</p>
<p>From The Bitch In the House:</p>
<p>“I believed myself to be a feminist, and I vowed never to fall into the same trap of domestic boredom and servitude that I saw my mother as being fully entrenched in; never to settle for a life that was, as I saw it, lacking independence, authority, and respect.” –E.S. Maduro, page 5</p>
<p>“Here are a few things people have said about me at the office: ‘You’re unflappable.’ ‘Are you ever in a bad mood?’ Here are things people—okay, the members of my family—have said about me at home: ‘‘Mommy is always grumpy.’ ‘Why are you so tense?’ ‘You’re too mean to live in this house and I want you to go back to work for the rest of your life!’” –Kristin van Ogtrop, page 161</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to be a bad mother I wanted to be my mother-safe, protective, rational, calm-without giving up all my anger, because my anger fueled me.” – Elissa Schappell, page 195</p>"

""Well, I don't do deception"" was a common resonse.</p>

Do you live in financial chaos? Do you underestimate your worth? Are you ready to go to the next level, but can't seem to get there? If the answer is yes to these questions, you may be an underearner.</p>
<p>Underearners are self-saboteurs who never live up to their earnings potential, says Barbara Stanny, a financial educator, motivational speaker, former journalist, and career counselor. Underearners tend to live paycheck to paycheck. They rarely balance their checkbooks and are often in debt. Ironically, many work incredibly hard. Yet they are ashamed to admit that money matters to them. They all have a high tolerance for low pay.</p>
<p>The good news is that underearning is often self-imposed. By focusing on overcoming underearning, you will not only earn what you deserve, but you can live up to your full potential. With techniques and exercises that have helped thousands of people who have participated in her Overcoming Underearning™ workshops, Stanny teaches you five essential steps to financial independence. Once you understand these steps, you will be confident asking for a raise, increasing your prices, or getting a better job. ""Now I'm making more than my friends, all because I had the guts to dream and ask for more,"" says one Stanny fan.</p>
<p><b>First, Tell the Truth</b>: be honest about your financial situation and figure out your attitudes toward money. Second, <b>Make a Decision</b>: decide that you want to make more money. Third, <b>Stretch</b>: take action, face your fears, and be willing to be uncomfortable. Fourth, <b>Create Community</b> by finding supporters and asking for help. Fifth, <b>Respect and Appreciate Money</b>: learn to save and invest.</p>
<p><b>Overcoming Underearning</b> is filled with inspiring, real-life stories of underearners who turned their lives around. Stanny brings a message of empowerment and hope to all those who chronically undervalue themselves. ""I'm making more, working less, feeling healthier, have more energy, and I'm so much happier,"" concludes another Stanny believer.</p>"

9780060931308,Hirohito And The Making Of Modern Japan,['Herbert P. Bix'],"<p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize</p>
<p>In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</p>
<p>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <b>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</b> is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled — as it still does — to come to terms with its past.</p>
<p>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <b>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</b> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</p>"

His latest misadventure finds him in Osaka to accept an award for an article he'd written years before about a teenage Bunraku puppet prodigy named Tetsuo.

In her latest book, Ms. Jenkins introduces cooks and readers to a cluster of core ingredients and foodways that are fundamental to all of the Mediterranean's diverse cuisines. She shows how the Mediterranean attitude toward food — a combination of respect, integrity, enthusiasm, and sheer joy — can be cultivated across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In twelve informative and captivating chapters, the author focuses on the core ingredients common to the diverse cuisines of the region: salt, wine and vinegar, pasta and couscous, bread, olive oil, Old World legumes, New World peppers and tomatoes, dairy products, the family pig, and the resources of the sea. In each chapter she travels to a different corner of the Inner Sea to describe how and why these essential ingredients are obtained, what determines their quality, and where they fit in local cuisines.</p>
<p>Each chapter draws on history and ethnography as much as on the lives of Mediterranean people today. Readers will delight in Majid Mahjoub, the colorful Tunisian ""Shakespeare of olive oil,"" and commiserate with Provencal cheese maker Yves van Weddingen as he struggles to maintain his standards in the face of bureaucratic demands. Home cooks will garner a new appreciation of high-quality Spanish jamon de bellota as they follow the Trigo family through the annual winter ritual of transforming the family pig into hams and sausages.</p>

For the newcomer is Guy LeMerle, a charlatan and seducer now masquerading as a priest, and the one man she fears more than any other.</p>
<p>Soeur Auguste has a secret. Once she was l'Ailée, ""The Winged One,"" star performer of a troupe led by LeMerle, before betrayal forced her to change her identity. But now the past has found her. Before long, thanks to LeMerle, suspicion and debauchery are breeding like a plague within the convent's walls — fueled by dark rumors of witchcraft, part of the false priest's brilliantly orchestratedscheme of revenge. To protect herself and her beloved child, l'Ailée will have to perform one last act of dazzling daring more audacious than any she has previously attempted.</p>

9780060875497,The Fair Tax Book: Saying Goodbye To The Income Tax And The Irs,['Neal Boortz'],"<p>Wouldn't you love to abolish the IRS ...<br>
Keep all the money in your paycheck ...<br>
Pay taxes on what you spend, not what you earn ...<br>
And eliminate all the fraud, hassle, and waste of our current system?</p>
<p>Then the FairTax is for you. In the face of the outlandish American tax burden, talk-radio firebrand Neal Boortz and Congressman John Linder are leading the charge to phase out our current, unfair system and enact the FairTax Plan, replacing the federal income tax and withholding system with a simple 23 percent retail sales tax on new goods and services. This dramatic revision of the current system, which would eliminate the reviled IRS, has already caught fire in the American heartland, with more than six hundred thousand taxpayers signing on in support of the plan.</p>
<p>As Boortz and Linder reveal in this first book on the FairTax, this radical but eminently sensible plan would end the annual national nightmare of filing income tax returns, while at the same time enlarging the federal tax base by collecting sales tax from every retail consumer in the country. The FairTax, they argue, would transform the fearsome bureaucracy of the IRS into a more transparent, accountable, and equitable tax collection system. Among other benefits, it will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make America's tax code truly voluntary, without reducing revenue</li>
<li>Replace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax</li>
<li>Protect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities</li>
<li>Eliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're paying</li>
<li>Bring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy</li>
</ul>
<p>Endorsed by scores of leading economists and supported by a huge and growing grassroots movement, the FairTax Plan could revolutionize the way America pays for itself. In this straight-talking book, Neal Boortz and John Linder show you how it would work—and how you can help make it happen.</p>"

9780060183097,"Against The Odds: The Story Of Aids Drug Development, Politics And Profits","['Peter Arno', 'Karyn L. Feiden']","Against the Odds is the most important book yet written about the quest for a cure and treatments for AIDS. Peter Arno and Karyn Feiden cut through the complex issues to tell the tragic, inspiring story behind the scenes of the AIDS crisis--how a diverse group of extraordinary people banded together to fight bureaucracy and greed to save lives. AIDS has been called the greatest public health menace of our time. But political and bottom-line agendas, coupled with fear, racism, and anti-gay sentiments, have made the battle against it a painful uphill struggle. During the first five years of the epidemic, Ronald Reagan never once uttered the word ""AIDS"" in public. George Bush has still not seen fit to announce a comprehensive AIDS policy. Ten years after the onset of the epidemic, some 130,000 American lives--more than twice the toll claimed by the Vietnam War--have been lost. Yet AZT and ddI remain the only approved drugs specifically intended to attack HIV, the virus widely believed to cause AIDS; and these are not cures by any stretch of the imagination. Against the Odds is an astonishing book. Sweeping in scope, rich with personal drama, it tells the whole story of the development, testing, and marketing of such drugs as AZT, ddI, ganciclovir, pentamidine, and Compound Q, to name a few. Against the Odds is the tale of government officials and agencies who have delayed the development of life-saving and life-prolonging drugs, and of others who have bent and changed their own rules to get treatments more swiftly to patients desperate for them. It is also the story of pharmaceutical companies: some have gouged the public to enhance their profit pictures; others have taken a chance that compassion will pay off better than greed. Most of all, Against the Odds is the story of the activist and patient communities who have informed themselves about this epidemic more fully than any community ever has and who have now altered the course of government policy toward AIDS"

However, two unexpected visitors - a young boy and an old man hidden in the shadows - are preparing to bomb the soon-to-be-filled church. The lone witness, a small tattercoat kit crouched beneath the oak branches, warns Joe's owner, Clyde; then, with claws and teeth, she stops the two would-be murderers. But the shock of the near disaster that might have killed half the village is only the beginning. The next morning Charlie's good friend, building contractor Ryan Flannery, awakens to find her estranged, philandering husband dead in her garage...and her own gun is missing. With suspicion falling squarely on Ryan's shoulders, Joe Grey, Dulcie, and Kit use their skills of break-and-enter to prove her innocence. But a stranger's sinister push into her life is as unexpected as the arrival, on the morning of the murder, of a handsome purebred hunting dog, a homeless stray who seems determined to move in with Ryan. Whatever hateful force has descended on the small seaside village, the three cats are soon paw-deep in a tangle of jealousy, greed, and carefully planned retribution. So they work the case as only cats can, passing information anonymously to the cops, making a heroic feline effort to nail the killer and catch the wedding bomber, and hoping to see the silver hunting dog settled safely into his new home."

9780060008499,Death in Dublin,['Bartholomew Gill'],"An Irish cultural treasure has been stolen from the Trinity College library: the Book of Kells, an ancient, exquisitely illustrated ninth-century amalgam of Christian doctrine and Celtic legend. Normally, theft would not fall under the jurisdiction of Peter McGarr of the Murder Squad, even one of this magnitude. But the heinous crime comes with an extra indignity: the brutal slaying of a night watchman, believed to have been a party to the felony. The fact that blood has been so freely spilled is most disturbing to McGarr, suggesting that the perpetrators' motive was not merely financial gain. Back-biting politics only further tangles the web of thievery and murder that McGarr must unravel quickly and completely. Mounting evidence suggests that the repercussions of this case may be more devastating than first imagined, pointing the intrepid detective toward a secret organization intent on nothing less than the destruction of contemporary Irish society. They call themselves the New Druids, dangerous zealots dedicated to returning Ireland to its ancient pagan state. Their deadly reach is wide, infiltrating the hallowed halls of Trinity College and quite possibly the Garda itself, forcing McGarr to doubt the loyalties of even his closest compatriots. With the dubious help of an unlikely partner - the millionaire publisher of a disreputable scandal sheet - McGarr undertakes the most perilous assignment of his career, plunging into a deadly maelstrom of secrets, deceptions, dark rituals...and the ever-escalating violence that even his most determined efforts cannot prevent."

9780029250556,"Clinical Supervision In Alcohol And Drug Abuse Counseling: Principles, Models, Methods",['David J. Powell'],"As the field of substance abuse counseling matures, the need for clinical supervisory training designed specifically for substance abuse counselors has become more urgent. Greater accountability - financial, ethical, and legal - necessitates a higher standard of professionalism. Counselor certification requirements encompass a growing body of skills, and such credentialing is even more important for supervisors. In this groundbreaking book. David J. Powell, a leading trainer of substance abuse counselors for the past decade and a half, outlines the knowledge base and core competencies that substance abuse supervisors will need in the coming years. The models of supervision typically relied on in substance abuse counseling are taken from established schools of therapy, utilizing developmental, psychodynamic, skills, and family therapy perspectives. The substance abuse field, which draws on all of these traditions, requires a model of supervision that synthesizes all these into a coherent whole even as it faithfully reflects the principles and practices specific to alcohol and drug abuse counseling. To meet this need, Powell has designed such a comprehensive, ""blended"" model, and here he offers easy-to-follow guidelines for its use with substance abuse counselors. From his new model Powell offers methods of supervisory contracting, observation, case presentation, modeling, feedback, intervention, and evaluation. He addresses ethical and legal concerns in the day-to-day contexts in which they can arise. Learning objectives and a variety of assessment instruments are also provided. Firmly grounded in both theory and practice, Powell's authoritative text will become the standard text for the training and education of supervisors in substance abuse counseling.

The drama of life in the West Country alternates with Stella's powerfully vivid memories of lovers, friends, and her anthropological sojourns in such exotic places as the Nile Valley in Egypt, the island of Malta, and among farmers in the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland. She has spent her life studying communities of people - their families, social structures, how they welcomed outsiders into their midst - remaining an observer, privileged to share in their intimate life but not obliged, and finally unwilling, to tie herself closely to any lover, friend, or social group. In Somerset, Stella once again finds an opportunity to become part of the web of relationships that make for human society. Her oldest friend's husband, now widowed, is interested in something more than friendship with her. Her neighbors turn out to be a dangerously violent and unstable family, a threat to the entire community as well as to Stella herself. An old friend, an archaeologist, poignantly seeks her out for companionship. How will independent-minded Stella, always reluctant to make an emotional commitment, respond?"

Indeed, we cannot understand America itself without understanding John Wayne. Born in a dyed-in-the-wool Republican town in Iowa, a football star and student leader, and a scholarship boy at USC, Wayne went to Hollywood because it was the truest meritocracy in America, the one place where his lack of wealth and connections could not hurt him. After spending the first decade of his career on Poverty Row, he emerged as a star in Stagecoach. But it was during World War II that Wayne - and America - emerged as superpowers. Wayne came to politics reluctantly, joining the mainstream of America in its confrontation with communism - and maintaining his opposition ever since. At heart, however, Wayne was a nonideological conservative. He loved his freedom, his friends, his women, and his booze. He believed in simple justice, and common decency, and he will always be beloved as a result.

But life in the glory lane has started to pale, and Dean has set off on a cross-country trip to figure out what's gone wrong. When he hits a lonely stretch of Colorado highway, he spies something that will shake up his gilded life in ways he can't imagine. A young woman . . . dressed in a beaver suit. 
<p>Blue Bailey is on a mission to murder her ex. Or at least inflict serious damage. As for the beaver suit she's wearing . . . Is it her fault that life keeps throwing her curveballs? Witness the expensive black sports car pulling up next to her on the highway and the Greek god stepping out of it.</p>
<p>Blue's career as a portrait painter is the perfect job for someone who refuses to stay in one place for very long. She needs a ride, and America's most famous football player has an imposing set of wheels. Now, all she has to do is keep him entertained, off guard, and fully clothed before he figures out exactly how desperate she is.</p>
<p>But Dean isn't the brainless jock she imagines, and Blue -- despite her petite stature -- is just about the toughest woman Dean has ever met. They're soon heading for his summer home where their already complicated lives and inconvenient attraction to each other will become entangled with a charismatic but aging rock star; a beautiful fifty-two-year-old woman trying to make peace with her rock and roll past; an eleven-year-old who desperately needs a family; and a bitter old woman who hates them all.</p>
<p>As the summer progresses, the wandering portrait artist and the charming football star play a high-stakes game, fighting themselves and each other for a chance to have it all.</p>

Yet many of his Northern contemporaries considered the Yankee-hating Semmes nothing more than a pirate. In either guise, Semmes commanded the most successful sea raider of all time - the C.S.S. Alabama. During a two-year cruise, she took nearly a hundred Federal merchant vessels out of the war and became a household word on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. Her final battle, off the coast of France against the U.S.S. Kearsarge, was an epic clash befitting the last one-on-one duel of wooden ships. A commander who carried out his mission without being able to bring his ship into a Southern port and whose crew had no allegiance to the Confederacy, Semmes is a brilliant and compelling figure in American military history."

Infection Protection is your personal guide to the self-treatment of infections, too often misdiagnosed, that can make you sick for weeks, months, and sometimes for life.

A lady of dignity and refinement, she spent her days investigating the squalid world of madness, probing the nation's worst hellholes. Professing conservative feminine values, with furious energy and keen political insight, she invaded the masculine realm of government to press her agenda. Indeed, the secret of her success was to use conventional rhetoric of female subordination and self-denial to camouflage her radical course of political action. A woman of profound religious conviction, Dix believed that God had called her to a divine mission: to become the voice of the mad, speaking for those unable to speak for themselves. Accordingly, she threw herself into her vocation with an all-consuming intensity. Obsessed with the insane, she all but ignored the most celebrated reform movements of her day, women's rights and antislavery. This has led most historians to underestimate her. Yet no Victorian woman matched Dix's record of concrete achievement nor lived a more intrepid life.

                        <p>With vivid and sometimes horrifying detail, Gollaher describes the tireless determination of mental health crusader Dorothea Dix, as she traveled on her own throughout the country visiting jails, prisons, asylums, and almshouses in a heroic effort on behalf of the indigent insane.

From his roots as a Mexican emigre, he has become the highest-paid investigator in the world, an elite troubleshooter who, in the course of his Mission: Impossible-like investigations, has posed as everything from a Mafia hit man to a billionaire construction magnate. Driven by his desire to root out corporate crime and expose dirty tricks in the federal government and the judiciary, he has tangled with crooked judges and kidnappers, counterfeiters and brutal terrorists, as well as greedy corporate magnates. In The Pena Files Pena thrills readers with the inside details of his most compelling and controversial cases, many of which have exposed profound and widespread federal corruption, such as: the covert destruction of the richest and most powerful Mafia empire in organized crime history. Along the way Pena discovered an intimate tie between organized crime and the U.S. State Department; corporate looting at PepsiCo and Frito-Lay that may have led to the White House, a possible connection so sensitive that Pena's life was threatened and the case ultimately killed; the exposure of such widespread corruption inside the Internal Revenue Service that Pena was able to persuade Congress to convene hearings that changed the way the IRS polices itself. The Pena Files provides a shocking tour of the underbelly of the American justice system. From corrupt senior IRS officials to power-mad federal prosecutors, the rogue's gallery in The Pena Files includes some of the most prominent public officials in the country.

Written in the form of a dialogue between an Israeli and an American Jew, the book is an imaginative extension of a talk the author had with Elie Wiesel, whom Golan views as a symbol of everything that is wrong in American Jewry's attitude toward Israel. Expressing the depth of Israeli resentment and rage at the presumption of self-styled ""friends"" who want Israel to behave only in ""moral"" ways that don't embarrass them, Golan asserts that American Jews have no right to advise or criticize Israel because they do not bear the cost of the results of their advice. American Jewry claims partnership with Israel in return for its support, but there can be no partnership between a parent who sends his son to fight in Lebanon and one who sends his son to college. Golan further argues that financial contributions to the United Jewish Appeal, the Jewish National Fund, and other agencies serve the needs of American Jewry more than the needs of Israel, that money is even used against Israeli interests, and that the way these funds are raised is corrupt and corrupting. Boldly opening the one ""forbidden"" topic in Israel-Diaspora relations, Golan declares that the only safe future for both Israelis and American Jews lies in the immigration of a significant number of the latter to Israel; that Israelis would gladly give up American money in exchange for American Jews; and that the problems of Israeli society they tend to cite as reasons for not immigrating can all be traced to the fact that they have not already done so.

Parents and children alike have been best friends - so it's no surprise that in high school Chris and Emily's friendship blossoms into something more. They've been soul mates since they were born.
<p> So when midnight calls from the hospital come in, no one is ready for the appalling truth: Emily is dead at seventeen from a gunshot wound to the head.

9780060726065,Celia Spa: Mi Vida (spanish Edition),"['Celia Cruz', 'Ana Cristina Reymundo']","For most Latinos under seventy, there has never been a time without Celia Cruz. Her career has spanned three generations and each one harbors memories of Celia's music. So deeply is she rooted into the collective Latin consciousness that her songs can be used as benchmarks to recall specific moments in one's's life. 
<p>After her recent death, nearly half a million people stood in line for hours, filed past her casket, and paid their respects in Miami and New York. Only a beloved queen has this kind of power to summon the masses on such a grand scale. Yet, this was only a sampling of her loyal public. All over the world there were mourners that could not attend, but anxiously followed the details on live television. Networks preempted their regular programming to bring the pageantry to the millions of adoring fans that could only be comforted by following the event as it unfolded on their TV screen. There were hours of retrospectives and tributes and even reruns of many previously televised interviews. People wanted to know more about her. They still do.</p>
<p>Celia was a woman of contrasts. She lived comfortably at the intersection of this contradiction. Her flamboyant costumes juxtaposed her simple and straightforward demeanor. She was open and accessible to her fans but staunchly private in her personal life. She was uninhibited without decadence; honest without offense; confident but not arrogant; and generous without fault. Her speech was simple but eloquent. One could easily miss the truth that floated in the spaces between her words. But above all, Celia was authentic and it was this authenticity that resonated so deeply with her public. They trusted her completely, even if they did not know her fully. Celia Cruz represents the pinnacle of what can be achieved with talent, hard work, faith and, most of all, guts.</p>
<p>The soul of Celia Cruz has remained her private domain all these remarkable years. Until now. Her rich, full life produced an extraordinary cache of archival information. Never-before-published personal pictures, notes, mementos, personal videos of Celia and Pedro touring the world and, at home and with family are but a part of what she has left us to tell her story.</p>
<p>This book is her story.</p>


                        <p>Based on well over 500 hours of taped interviews recorded just months before her death, this authorized, posthumous memoir will included never before told personal anecdotes, and photographs of the Queen of Salsa's extraordinary life.

In the aftermath of a sudden divorce, Mariah struggles with depression and Faith seeks solace in a new friend - a friend who may or may not be imaginary. Faith talks to her ""Guard"" constantly and begins to recite passages from the Bible - a book she's never read. Fearful for her daughter's sanity, Mariah sends her to several psychiatrists. Yet when Faith develops stigmata and begins to perform miraculous healings, Mariah wonders if her daughter - a girl with no religious background - might indeed be seeing God. As word spreads and controversy heightens, Mariah and Faith are besieged by believers and disbelievers alike; they are caught in a media circus that threatens what little stability they have left. What are you willing to believe? Is Faith a prophet or a troubled little girl? Is Mariah a good mother facing an impossible crisis ... or a charlatan using her daughter to reclaim the attention her unfaithful husband withheld? As the story builds to a climactic battle for custody, Mariah must discover that spirit is not necessarily something that comes from religion but from inside oneself."
9780060392178,A Man And His Mother: An Adopted Son's Search,['Tim Green'],"For years, Tim Green seemed to be living the American dream. A handsome, intelligent honor student, he was also a strapping 6'2"", 250-pound All-American defensive end at Syracuse University, where he led the historically successful football program back to national prominence. On the strength of his stellar college football years, Tim became a coveted first-round draft choice of the Atlanta Falcons, going on to a sensational career in the NFL. But appearances can be deceiving. There was a void that numerous academic accolades and the adoration of cheering fans could not fill. Though he was raised in a loving and supportive family, Tim, an adopted child, had always longed to find his biological mother. Tim acutely felt the need to locate his biological mother, to let her know that he was all right - that he was successful and happy. Empathizing with the feelings of loss and regret that a mother who had given up a child must feel, he sought not only to find answers to his own questions but to answer those of his biological mother - a woman who somewhere, sometimes, must have thought of the son she could not keep. Bolstered by the love and support of his adoptive parents, Tim embarked on an odyssey to discover the woman who had given him his life - and then left him before she could become a part of it."
9780029334355,Lenin: A New Biography,"['Volkogonov, D. A. (dmitriĭ Antonovich)']","For years, westerners have wondered what secrets were preserved not only in the KGB archives, but also in dozens of other off-limits locations. Now that Dmitri Volkogonov, historian and former general in the Soviet Army, has been entrusted with the management of the archives as a Special Assistant to Boris Yeltsin, we at last have a chance to find out. For the last three years he has combed through more than 3700 once-secret documents covering every piece of information in the archive system concerning Vladimir Ilyitch Lenin and his legacy. He has woven this mountain of information into a compelling story of the Soviet founding father and the system he created. Volkogonov offers a radical departure from the traditional interpretation of Lenin as an idealist. Many of the characteristics of so-called Stalinism, he shows, arose in Lenin's lifetime, often on Lenin's direct orders. From the creation of concentration camps, to brutal repression of the church and the media, to the strategic cultivation of a cult of personality, Lenin's leadership was cruel and totalitarian. Volkogonov also offers select revelations from the post-Lenin years in order to demonstrate that the worst excesses of the Soviet state all had their roots in its founding father. In Volkogonov's words, for years ""we asked ourselves where Stalin had acquired the cruelty which he inflicted on his fellow countrymen. None of us - the present author included - could begin to imagine that the father of domestic Russian terrorism, merciless and totalitarian, could have been Lenin.""

                        <p>The first biography of the Soviet founder based on full access to the newly opened Russian archives. This compelling story of Lenin and the system he created demonstrates that many of the characteristics of so-called Stalinism were firmly laid down in Lenin's lifetime, usually on Lenin's direct orders. 8-page photo insert.

Forget the legendary carousing, the barroom brawling, the heavy-metal head-banging, and the endless supply of uncensored, often havoc-wreaking quotes. Forget the feuds with dumb-a**ed fans, wrong-headed managers and the entire city of Cleveland. Even if Perfect, I'm Not was to blindly (and insanely) ignore all those amazing aspects of David Wells' life as a major leaguer, his story would still bounce off these pages as a wildly entertaining and jaw-droppingly honest look at the game of baseball. Nothing less would be possible. Wells simply isn't wired for spin-doctoring. He has no ""delete"" button. He pulls no punches. In a sport that's now largely populated by a bland collection of well-dressed, personality-free, cliché-spouting Stepford jocks, Wells clearly holds the title of ""baseball's most beloved bad-ass"". 
<p>From rookie ball amid the beer-soaked, frozen tundra of the Great White North, through Winter Ball amid the easy women and explosive diarrhea of Venezuela, <i>Perfect I'm Not</i> explores Boomer's long, strange, often insane climb through the minors. And from the Siberia of the Blue Jays' bullpen, through intensive training with a brilliant little Yoda known as Sparky Anderson, the book also examines how Boomer grew from a mediocre reliever, into a solid, reliable, hugely successful starter. From there, after tortured dealings with Marge Schott in Cincinatti, and Pat Gillick in Baltimore, the book follows Boomer deep inside the New York Yankees' dugout, right through the teams' fairy-tale seasons of '97 and '98. It stands with David on the mound through his legendary perfect game.</p>
<p>It documents his high-profile love affair with the night-life of New York City, and then explores just how devastating it felt to be unceremoniously dumped for Roger Clemens. <i>Perfect I'm Not</i> also follows Boomer through his chronic back pain of 2001, then surgery, rehab, uncertainty, and one pinstriped Christmas miracle, courtesy of Boss Steinbrenner. And though the 2002 season may have enjoyed a less than perfect climax, it nonetheless rounds out the book with a Yankees reunion that kept Boomer smiling from February, right into October.</p>
<p><i>Perfect I'm Not</i> gives readers an unprecedented, all-access pass to every major league stadium in the country, providing a first-person perspective of life on the diamond, as well as an uncensored, warts-and-all, insider's guide to life inside locker-rooms, hotel rooms, planes, dugouts, buses, bedrooms, restaurants, strip clubs, and more. It's great fun. It's real. It's as close as you're ever gonna get to making the show.</p>

As the smoke slowly clears, Remy finds that his memory is skipping, lurching between moments of lucidity and days when he doesn't seem to be living his own life at all. The landscape around him is at once fractured and oddly familiar: a world dominated by a Machiavellian mayor known as ""The Boss,"" and peopled by gawking celebrities, anguished policemen peddling First Responder cereal, and pink real estate divas hyping the spoils of tragedy. Remy himself has a new girlfriend he doesn't know, a son who pretends he's dead, and an unsettling new job chasing a trail of paper scraps for a shadowy intelligence agency known as the Department of Documentation. Whether that trail will lead Remy to an elusive terror cell - or send him circling back to himself - is only one of the questions posed by this provocative yet deeply human novel."

In Buppies, B-Boys, Baps &amp; Bohos, Nelson George chronicles the saga of post-soul culture, which, he believes, hinges on the aesthetic metamorphosis of two important movements - hip hop music and Black film - and gives shape and voice to the four African American character types of the book's title that have emerged from the fallout of desegregation and have been crucial in redefining this country over the last twenty years. In this first collection of essays, George covers music, film, sports, publishing, politics, and city life uptown and down. He ponders the first unheralded dis-chords and gritty, aural graffiti of today's B-boy rappers, and the powerful message-laden music of Tracy Chapman; the thematic films of Spike Lee; the Brooklyn-beginnings of Willie Randolph; the novels of Toni Morrison; the Supreme Court appointment of Clarence Thomas; the politics of Al Sharpton; and much more. With moving personal strokes, he also paints everyday life in the Black community: the tragic and questionable murder of a promising Harlem youth by a white police officer; the issue of light versus dark skin; the indignities and humiliations experienced daily by Black men in today's society. Virtually every aspect of Black urban America is explored in these pages as he introduces roisterous rappers and legendary hoopsters, streetwise hustlers and influential filmmakers, unsung session men of the Motown sound and crack dealers. Few are better placed to sum up the last twenty charged years than Nelson George, who reports from the front lines of Black urban culture in his long-standing and widely-acclaimed Village Voice column, ""Native Son,"" and whose sharp commentary has won him national recognition as on"

This not only brought him patronage from powerful figures of the day but also put him in direct conflict with the Catholic Church. Arrested by the Inquisition and tried as a heretic, Bruno was imprisoned, tortured, and, after eight years, burned at the stake in 1600. The Vatican ""regrets"" the burning yet refuses to clear him of heresy. But Bruno's philosophy spread: Galileo, Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, and Gottfried Leibniz all built upon his ideas; his thought experiments predate the work of such twentieth-century luminaries as Karl Popper; his religious thinking inspired such radicals as Baruch Spinoza; and his work on the art of memory had a profound effect on William Shakespeare. Chronicling a genius whose musings helped bring about the modern world, Michael White pieces together the final years -- the capture, trial, and the threat the Catholic Church felt -- that made Bruno a martyr of free thought."

<br>
Imagine what it's like to see happy children in Iraq and Afghanistan smiling and waving at U.S. military helicopters. <br>
<br>
Imagine what it's like to be an undersized linebacker in the National Football League, where most of the players you're supposed to tackle weigh more than you. <br>
<br>
Imagine what it's like to be the seventh of nine kids growing up in an Irish Catholic family in the 1970s. <br>
<br>
Imagine what it's like to be Robert McGovern, current captain in the U.S. Army, National Football League veteran, and proud member of a loving New Jersey family. <br>
<br>
Robert McGovern has a story to tell - not about himself, although he's a part of it - but about the men and women he has called friends, mentors, and heroes. From his days in Catholic school to his years as a college and professional football player to his current career as an army judge advocate general, McGovern knows an all-American when he sees one. And in this book he introduces you to the ones he's met from all walks of life. <br>
<br>
McGovern traded his shoulder pads for legal briefs more than a decade ago. He prosecuted drug dealers while working in the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. On September 11, 2001, he was in lower Manhattan when the Twin Towers fell. After working the pile at Ground Zero, McGovern asked to be mobilized from his Army Reserve duty to active duty. He was first sent to Afghanistan, where he advised battlefield commanders on legal rules of engagement. He then went to Iraq to prosecute terrorist suspects. He returned from both tours convinced that Americans needed to hear another side of the war on terrorism - the side he saw firsthand.
<p><b>Author's Response to the Critics:</b><br>
I am the author of <i>All American</i> and I would like to provide Barnes &amp; Noble readers with a response to some critical reviews of my book that have recently been posted to the Barnes &amp; Noble listing for my book. In sum, the reviews of my book criticize me for serving as a brainwashed cheerleader for the Bush administration and our Iraq policy. These critics further claim that I refuse to admit that anything bad has even happened in Iraq and that I paint an unrealistically rosy picture of a difficult and costly conflict. I disagree with these reviews completely. Based on some of their conclusions, it is only reasonable to assume that the reviewers must have failed to read significant sections of my book. I do not deny that that the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have been difficult. I was there, I know first hand. Instead, I state that it is the mainstream news coverage of the war that has provided Americans with an unrealistic picture of the war and, I believe, Americans are entitled to an accurate and complete picture of what is happening over there. As I stated on the very first page of my book, we are living in a difficult and divided time in our nation's history. I didn't write this book to make those divisions worse. I wrote this book to get a few things off my chest and to tell you about some incredible heroes I've met along the way. I also wrote this book so that our nation can have a full and complete discussion on the direction of our country and to encourage all of us to hash out our differences in a civil manner. These reviews only serve to further drive a wedge between Americans. My book was not intended for this purpose. My book was written in order to start a discussion that will, hopefully, bring us closer together as a nation. A discussion that will enable us to talk to each other as friends and neighbors—not as adversaries. We may disagree with each other but we will be talking to each other. Let the conversation begin. — Robert McGovern</p>"
9780029185551,On Great Service: A Framework For Action,['Leonard L. Berry'],"Improving service quality has finally become a top priority of management today, yet according to service quality expert Leonard Berry only a handful of companies have managed to determine exactly what to improve and how to improve it. For the past two years, Berry studied dozens of companies of all sizes renowned for their capacity to deliver what they promise and more. From his on-site observation of the strategies and practices of such companies as Mary Kay Cosmetics, Tattered Cover Book Store, Longo Toyota &amp; Lexus, Lakeland Regional Medical Center, and Hard Rock Cafe, Berry has constructed a dynamic new framework for improving service. 
<p>This framework provides a roadmap for implementation found nowhere else in the service quality literature. In every chapter Berry draws on his twelve years of research in service quality to explain each part of the framework in detail. He provides rich insights and inspiring examples of great service -- including numerous examples unique to this book as well as the classic success stories of USAA, Taco Bell, and many more. Berry shows that a company must (1) develop service leadership skills and values -- a concept substantially different from developing general leadership; (2) build a service quality information system; and (3) create a comprehensive service strategy based on the four principles of great service: reliability, surprise, recovery, and fairness. He demonstrates how these four principles, when adopted by the leadership and infused into the systems of a service company, are the building blocks of the framework and form the anchor for implementation.</p>
<p>Berry shows how the ""artistry"" of great service can be systematically created from this foundation through a company's organizational structure, technology, and often under utilized human resources assets.</p>

9780029089262,Fall Of The Asante Empire: The Hundred-year War For Africa's Gold Coast,['Robert B. Edgerton'],"In 1817, the first British envoy to meet the king of the Asante of West Africa was dazzled by his reception. A group of 5,000 Asante soldiers, many wearing immense caps topped with three foot eagle feathers and gold ram's horns, engulfed him with a ""zeal bordering on phrensy,"" shooting muskets into the air. The envoy was escorted, as no fewer than 100 bands played, to the Asante king's palace and greeted by a tremendous throng of 30,000 noblemen and soldiers, bedecked with so much gold that his party had to avert their eyes to avoid the blinding glare. Some Asante elders wore gold ornaments so massive they had to be supported by attendants. But a criminal being lead to his execution - hands tied, ears severed, knives thrust through his cheeks and shoulder blades - was also paraded before them as a warning of what would befall malefactors. This first encounter set the stage for one of the longest and fiercest wars in all the European conquest of Africa. At its height, the Asante empire, on the Gold Coast of Africa in present-day Ghana, comprised three million people and had its own highly sophisticated social, political, and military institutions. Armed with European firearms, the tenacious and disciplined Asante army inflicted heavy casualties on advancing British troops, in some cases defeating them. They won the respect and admiration of British commanders, and displayed a unique willingness to adapt their traditional military tactics to counter superior British technology. Even well after a British fort had been established in Kumase, the Asante capital, the indigenous culture stubbornly resisted Europeanization, as long as the ""golden stool,"" the sacred repository of royal power, remained in Asante hands. It was only after an entire century of fighting that resistance ultimately ceased.

                        <p>For the first time, anthropologist Robert Edgerton tells the story of the Hundred-Year War--from 1807 to 1900, between the British Empire and the Asante Kingdom--from the Asante point of view. Edgerton provides a much-needed correction to our one-sided view of native African societies as weak targets for colonial oppression.

9780060391560,Searching For The Promised Land: An African American's Optimistic Odyssey,['Gary Franks'],"In 1990, Gary Franks became America's first black Republican to serve in Congress in sixty years. Now, in Searching for the Promised Land: An African American's Optimistic Odyssey, Congressman Franks gives us his singular outlook on such controversial topics as welfare reform, the Nation of Islam, and race relations in the United States. As an outspoken black conservative, he has endured the wrath of traditional liberals, including Jesse Jackson, who staged a march and sit-in outside Franks's offices in 1995. From his childhood in working-class Waterbury, Connecticut, to his well-publicized clashes with the ultraliberal Congressional Black Caucus in Washington, D.C., Congressman Franks chronicles the experiences that have defined his principles and shaped his politics. The son of a former North Carolina sharecropper with a sixth-grade education, Franks graduated from Yale and - defying all predictions - won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. There, he has worked tirelessly to restore America's inner cities and encourage its struggling businesses by harnessing the power of private industry. A dedicated leader who is concerned for all Americans, he outlines rational alternatives to the current welfare system that has left entire families dependent on the government - a system he feels is as crippling and controlling as slavery itself. In 1993, Franks was blacklisted by his fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus when they changed the caucus's rules specifically to exclude him from weekly meetings. Franks courageously stood up to the small-minded intolerance the caucus showed him and fought to reinstate himself. This intolerance of differing opinions, Franks argues, has stifled black leadership and is hindering the progress of African Americans. He alone opposed the caucus's alliance with the Nation of Islam and defended Clarence Thomas's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Throughout this memoir, Congressman Franks speaks eloquently and passi"

But in 1994, with the economy flourishing, voters dumped the Democrats. What happened? Why? What is likely to happen next? Ben Wattenberg answers with Values Matter Most, a book that is, at once, a fascinating and lively inside political story, a nuanced portrait of America in the mid-nineties, and a stark political thesis. In the controversial 1970 bestseller The Real Majority, Wattenberg and Richard Scammon argued that the social issue - now often called values - including crime, welfare, race, discipline, drugs, promiscuity and prayer - had suddenly become coequal with economics as the key to voter behavior. They warned Democrats to pay attention, or they would lose. They didn't, and they did. Now, after 25 years of social deterioration in America, Wattenberg dramatically advances the argument. He says that the concern about values has become the number one issue, and properly so. Wattenberg vividly narrates the history of the values issue in American politics. He says that whichever party and candidates now best understand the social concerns of a restless electorate, and act upon these issues, will be rewarded in national, state, and local elections in 1996 and beyond. He caps his analysis with strategy lessons for Republicans, Democrats, and potential third (or even fourth or fifth) party candidates.                        <p>A salvo against the conventional wisdom about American life and politics, Values Matter Most properly deals with what troubles Americans most--The Social Issue--crime, welfare, race, discipline, and more.

Erikson, one of the movement's most creative and influential thinkers. Dr. Roazen contends that while Erikson has succeeded in revitalizing the Freudian tradition, ""we would repay him poorly as a teacher if we allowed him to be loosely understood or inadequately challenged."" This examination of Erikson's contributions - among them the concepts of identity and the life cycle and the discipline of psychohistory - revisits Freud in light of Erikson and Erikson in terms of Freud. Dr. Roazen's dependable scholarship makes for fluent juxtapositions, and the reciprocity enhances our understanding of both visions."
9780060936518,The Best American Science Writing 2003,['Oliver Sacks'],"In his introduction to The Best American Science Writing 2003, Dr. Oliver Sacks, whom the New York Times has called ""the poet laureate of medicine,"" writes that ""the best science writing ... cannot be completely 'objective' -- how can it be when science itself is so human an activity? -- but it is never self-induglently subjective either. It is, at best, a wonderful fusion, as factual as a news report, as imaginative as a novel."" It is with this definition of ""good"" science writing in mind that Dr. Sacks has selected the twenty-five extraordinary pieces that make up the latest installment of this acclaimed annual.
<p>This year, Peter Canby travels into the heart of remote Africa to track a remarkable population of elephants; Atul Gawande shows us the way doctors learn their skills by performing supposedly routine procedures on unsuspecting patients. With candor and tenderness, Floyd Skloot observes the toll Alzheimer's disease is taking on his ninety-one-year-old mother, and is fascinated by the memories she retains. Marcelo Gleiser asks: If we are the universe's sole intelligent species, then what must we do to be good citizens of the cosmos? Natalie Angier writes about the challenge of traveling to distant stars. Gunjan Sinha explores the mating behavior of the common prairie vole and what it reveals about the human pattern of monogamy. Michael Klesius attempts to solve what Darwin called ""an abominable mystery"": How did flowers originate? Lawrence Osborne tours a farm where a genetically modified goat produces the silk of spiders in its milk. Joseph D'Agnese visits a home for retired medical research chimps. And in the collection's final piece, Richard C. Lewontin and Richard Levins reflect on how the work of Stephen Jay Gould demonstrated the value of taking a radical approach to science.</p>
<p> As this series firmly attests, science writing has achieved a central place in our culture, and one can posit that the reason why has to do with the special thrill of discovery that a cogent piece of science writing can elicit. As Dr. Sacks writes of Stephen Jay Gould -- to whose memory this year's anthology is dedicated -- an article of his ""was never predictable, never dry, could not be imitated or mistaken for anybody else's."" The same can be said of all of the writing contained in contributions to this diverse collection ""that can be enjoyed by laymen, scientists, and writers alike"" (NATURE).</p>"

Could a better general than Saddam Hussein have derailed Operation Desert Storm? What were the relative contributions of air, ground, and naval power? Did air power win the war?

Chinworth relates the dramatic story of Japan's recent defense industrial development and identifies the Japanese strategy for the year 2000. In the process, he examines the pattern of defense policies and procurement that have led Japan to its present position as a near military power in the region, asks why and how the world's second largest economic power buys its weapons, and speculates on how patterns may change in the future. He also demonstrates why and how the United States has contributed to Japan's military growth through generous technology transfers and the protection of their bilateral security treaty. This important new book also contains lessons for a budget-conscious United States. Due to the new geopolitical balance and severe budget constraints, America of the 1990s faces the most radical restructuring of its defense posture since the end of World War II. The Japanese defense industry, on the other hand, has long operated in an austere economic and budgetary environment.

9780060747664,The Age Of Abundance: How Prosperity Transformed America's Politics And Culture,"['Lindsey, Brink.']","In The Age of Abundance, Brink Lindsey offers a bold reinterpretation of the latter half of the twentieth century. Following the rapid expansion of postwar America's economy, widespread affluence triggered tumultuous cultural changes that resulted in the contemporary ideologies of left and right. By shifting people's needs from tangible, day-to-day requirements like food, clothes, and employment to more intangible, value-based ones-a search for meaning, equality, and self-expression on the left and a subsequent quest for stability and a return to traditional values on the right-mass prosperity has shaped today's polarized, ""red vs. blue"" political atmosphere. So how do we move past the stalemate and toward useful political discourse? Lindsey persuasively argues that an emerging consensus that mixes the social freedom of the left with the economic freedom of the right is trying to do just that-and it might be our best hope. A breathtaking re-evaluation of our recent past, The Age of Abundance will change the way we think about the future.<br>

Allied forces launched a massive assault on the Rhineland as they prepared to push into the heart of the Third Reich. With the heavy casualties suffered by white soldiers at the Battle of the Bulge, black soldiers, for the first time, played a major combat role. And Sergeant Eddie Carter was right in the thick of the battle, serving in the 12th Armored Division under Patton, as he fought to secure the Rhine and stop the Nazis in their tracks. With a zealous fearlessness, Carter single-handedly captured several Germans and secured reconnaissance that would be critical in capturing Speyer. His efforts would win him a Distinguished Service Cross. But it wasn't until fifty-two years later that Carter was awarded the Medal of Honor. Here is the untold story of why the American government not only withheld Carter's much due recognition but why they also denied him -- one of the most decorated black American soldiers in WWII -- the opportunity to reenlist. And here, too, is the inspiring story of the valiant Carter family -- from the moving courtship of Eddie and his wife, Mildred, to the family's unrelenting efforts to get the American government to apologize and own up to the racism and McCarthyism that fueled years of deceit and bigotry."

9780060886882,"Triple Cross: How Bin Laden's Master Spy Penetrated The Cia, The Green Berets, And The Fbi--and Why Patrick Fitzgerald Failed To Stop Him","['Lance, Peter.']","In the years leading to the 9/11 attacks, no single agent of al Qaeda was more successful in compromising the U.S. intelligence community than Ali Mohamed. A former Egyptian army captain, Mohamed succeeded in infiltrating the CIA in Europe, the Green Berets at Fort Bragg, and the FBI in California - even as he helped to orchestrate the al Qaeda campaign of terror that culminated in 9/11. As investigative reporter Peter Lance demonstrates in this gripping narrative, senior U.S. law enforcement officials - including the now-celebrated U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who personally interviewed Mohamed long before he was brought to ground - were powerless to stop him. In the annals of espionage, few men have moved between the hunters and the hunted with as much audacity as Ali Mohamed. For almost two decades, the former Egyptian army commando succeeded in living a double life. <br>
<br>
Brazenly slipping past watch lists, he moved in and out of the U.S. with impunity, marrying an American woman, becoming a naturalized citizen, and posing as an FBI informant - all while acting as chief of security for Osama bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. Known to his fellow terrorists as Ali Amiriki, or ""Ali the American,"" Mohamed gained access to the most sensitive intelligence in the U.S. counterterrorism arsenal while brokering terror summits, planning bombing missions, and training jihadis in bomb building, assassination, the creation of sleeper cells, and other acts of espionage. <br>
<br>
Building on the investigation he first chronicled in his previous books, <i>1000 Years for Revenge and Cover Up</i>, Lance uses Mohamed to trace the untold story of al Qaeda's rise in the 1980s and 1990s. Incredibly, Mohamed, who remains in custodial witness protection today, has never been sentenced for his crimes. He exists under a veil of secrecy - a living witness to how the U.S. intelligence community was outflanked for years by the terror network. <br>
<br>
From his first appearance on the FBI's radar in 1989 - training Islamic extremists on Long Island - to his presence in the database of Operation Able Danger eighteen months before 9/11, this devious triple agent was the one terrorist they had to sweep under the rug. Filled with news-making revelations, <i>Triple Cross</i> exposes the incompetence and duplicity of the FBI and Justice Department before 9/11...and raises serious questions about how many more secrets the Feds may still be hiding."
9780028740348,Winner-take-all Society,"['Robert H. Frank', 'Philip J. Cook']","In this book, two distinguished economists draw attention to an important and disturbing new trend that has dramatically transformed our economy in the last two decades: the spread of ""winner-take-all"" markets, where more and more people compete for ever fewer and bigger prizes. Such markets, where tiny differences in performance translate into huge differences in reward, have long been the hallmark of the performing arts and professional sports, where increasingly sophisticated recording technologies and the global reach of television have enabled millions to listen to and watch only ""star"" artists and athletes, leaving nothing for the also-rans. In recent years, however, winner-take-all markets have reached into virtually every part of the nation's economic life, spreading into such businesses as fashion, investment banking, and media; into professions like law and medicine; into higher education; and, increasingly, into management itself. While not for a moment denying that consumers have sometimes benefited - nobody has to listen to a second-rate soprano when virtually everyone can afford recordings of first-rate singers - Frank and Cook argue persuasively that, on balance, the result has been disastrous. They show how winner-take-all markets have dramatically widened the gap between rich and poor by concentrating all rewards among just a small handful of winners, and how they have lured some of our most talented individuals into socially unproductive and sometimes even destructive pursuits. Finally, in their relentless stress on winners - the bestselling novel, the blockbuster film, and so on - winner-take-all markets have diluted our culture in ways that many people find deeply disturbing.

                        <p>In this pathbreaking book, the subject of considerable pre-publication, two distinguished economists draw attention to an important and disturbing new trend that has dramatically transformed our economy in the last two decades: the spread of ""winner-take-all"" markets, where marginal differences in performance translate into huge differences in reward.

Leaving his home in Aspen, which had become a false Shangra-la for him,

Carefully, impulsively (and also illegally), he tapped into the main irrigation channel. And so began - though few knew it at the time (least of all Joe) - the great Milagro beanfield war. But like everything else in the dirt-poor town of Milagro, it would be a patchwork war, fought more by tactical retreats than battlefield victories. Gradually, ever so fumblingly, the small farmers and sheepmen began to rally to Joe's beanfield as the symbol of their lost rights and their lost lands. And downstate in the capital, the Anglo water barons and power brokers huddled in urgent conference, intent on destroying that symbol before it destroyed their multimillion-dollar land-development schemes. The tale of Milagro's rising is widly comic and lovingly tender, a vivid portrayal of a town that, half-stumbling and partly prodded, groped its way toward it own stubborn salvation."

9780028704715,Bebop And Nothingness: Jazz And Pop At The End Of The Century,['Francis Davis'],"Jazz is more popular than it has been since the early sixties. Every major record label is bringing out jazz reissues and new releases, and dating couples are turning up in the jazz clubs alongside the usual middle-aged male fans. But this popularity comes at a cost: Jazz has become identified with its past, and especially with bebop, the style that first dominated the jazz scene in the forties and fifties. Bebop started out as a daring departure from the conventions of swing, but ironically, many listeners and musicians now experience this style as a comfortable orthodoxy that defines the limits of jazz. In his third collection of essays, Francis Davis shares his insights into this new jazz mainstream: the greatness of its sources, the sterility of performance that follows those sources too closely. He also conveys his listening experiences beyond the mainstream - from the futuristic jazz of the avant-garde to the pre-forties styles that some performers continue to develop, at the risk of being labeled old hat. Finally, Davis leaves behind the boundaries of jazz altogether, pursuing its adventurous spirit into a broader musical territory that includes musical theatre, rock, and rap.

                        <p>Jazz has never been more popular than today. Davis, a leading jazz authority, attacks those who wish to return jazz to its roots, but who fail to continue to create new and vital music. He artfully conveys his listening experiences, venturing beyond the mainstream, and pursues the adventurous spirit of jazz into a broader musical territory.

9780029236857,Nixon's Piano: Presidents And Racial Politics From Washington To Clinton,"[""Kenneth O'reilly""]","Kenneth O'Reilly, whose Racial Matters blew the lid off the FBI's investigation and harassment of black leaders, now scrutinizes each president's record on race. Nixon's Piano reveals that instead of being the agents of progress in racial relations, American presidents have a long and consistent history of supporting slavery, obstructing civil rights, and deliberately fanning racism. With the exceptions of Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, argues O'Reilly, every president has sacrificed black rights for white votes. Perhaps most alarming, O'Reilly offers substantial evidence of presidents whose repressive political policies violated their own moral code. George Washington corresponded with Lafayette about the evils of slavery and mused about establishing a plantation for freed blacks, but President Washington kept his slaves and refused to lend the weight of his office to the abolitionist movement. Jefferson, certain and eloquent on the subject of equality in the Declaration of Independence, found no voice as president to oppose slavery. Lincoln, the first president to allow blacks at White House social functions and the eventual hero of the abolitionist movement, opposed black efforts to vote, sit on juries, hold office, or marry whites. Like many other presidents, Lincoln supported the colonization movement as the simplest solution to the nation's racial strife. FDR, the father of twentieth century social reform, but fearful of offending white voters, refused to support an anti-lynching law, banned black reporters from press conferences, and undermined his own Fair Employment Practice Committee. More recent presidents, according to O'Reilly, have pursued a racial politics ranging from the timid to the devious. With substantial evidence and insightful analysis of both official policy and private conduct, O'Reilly illustrates that the principle of white over black has been the fundamental organizing principle of American politics from the beginning of our nat

                        <p>O'Reilly, whose Racial Matters blew the lid off the FBI's investigation and harassment of black leaders, now paints a revealing portrait of each president's record on race. He documents that, with the exception of Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, American presidents have used the power of their office to impede racial equality.

9780060391973,Whores Of The Court: The Fraud Of Psychiatric Testimony And The Rape Of American Justice,['Margaret A. Hagen'],"Lawyers often refer to them as ""prostitutes"" or ""whores."" They are the growing ranks of clinical psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other mental health professionals who give expert testimony in our courtrooms today. And in far too many cases their testimony - on subjects as varied as determination of competency, dangerousness, parental fitness, custody, personal injury, memory, sentencing, and rehabilitation - helps determine the final verdict. Now, in this provocative and well-researched book, Margaret Hagen, Ph.D., reveals how expert psychological testimony is a total fraud, showing how the courts have increasingly embraced not a cutting-edge science but, instead, a discipline that represents a terrifying retreat into fantasy and hearsay; a discipline propelled by powerful propaganda, arrogance, and greed. There are now thousands of self-styled soul doctors running amok in our courts, bedazzled by spectacular fees and wielding unchecked power and influence in the courtroom.

After the police department's first unsuccessful attempts to catch the killer, the case lay dormant, and the culprit remained free. <p>Enter Leonard Levitt.

But Levitt's articles about his findings -- and the haunting questions they raised -- almost never saw the light of day. For years, Levitt's superiors mysteriously refused to publish the stories. Convinced that the Moxley family deserved the peace and closure they had so long been denied, Levitt fought desperately to keep his discoveries alive. Finally, after Levitt's first article appeared, the case was reopened.</p><p>Enter Frank Garr. As the newly appointed investigator on the Moxley case, the seasoned Greenwich detective doggedly pursued unexplored leads and became increasingly convinced that for over a decade, his colleagues had been pursuing the wrong suspects.

Clifton, Jr. Berry']","Over the past forty years, we have seen more advances in science and technology than in all of previous history. Our world has been transformed in ways that surpass the wildest imagination: advances in telecommunications let us sit in our living rooms and watch events taking place on the other side of the planet - wars, sporting events, famines, revolutions - as they actually occur; high school students around the world think nothing today of doing their homework on personal computers, each a fraction of the size and hundreds of times more powerful than the experimental models of the Fifties; doctors routinely perform delicate surgery with lasers. Fiberoptic cables connected to video cameras permit them to see inside the body and operate through tiny holes in the skin or without cutting the skin at all; military pilots and soldiers use infrared technology to see in the dark and electronic guidance to attack distant targets with unbelievable precision. Electronic simulators, like the time machines of science fiction, let them fight the wars of the future in a world of ""virtual reality; and meteorologists, with data gathered by satellites and processed by computers, predict the movement of dangerous storms and save untold lives every year. In medicine, communications, education, defense, transportation - everywhere we look - science and technology have changed our way of life. This lavishly illustrated book chronicles the development of some of the essential technologies that, almost overnight, have changed the way you live: microchips, microprocessors and computers, communications satellites, simulators, lasers, fiber optics, thermal imaging, radar, and more. Inventing the Future is fascinating reading because it includes the inspiring stories of the inventors - creative men and women with visions and the courage to pursue them.

Platten']","People, Performance, and Pay identifies today's four most common organizational work cultures - functional, process, time-based, and network - and explains how to align innovative pay policies with each. With examples from LEGO, Hallmark, Holiday Inn, and other leading organizations, the authors explain how to assess an organization's current culture and determine what its future culture should be. They then demonstrate pay's role in such change initiatives, and how compensation must be integrated with other human resource processes, such as selection, training, and performance management. They also discuss the full range of pay strategies available today and how they can be best used to move the organization forward; for example, they recommend decreasing an organization's emphasis on base pay as it shifts from a functional culture to a process, time-based, or network culture. They also offer guidance on establishing team rewards, especially important in process and team-based cultures, and make a compelling case for putting more pay at risk through variable pay strategies. Here also is strategic advice on competency-based pay, performance-based rewards such as gain-sharing, executive pay, and benefits programs. As responsibility for compensation strategies and compensation decisions shifts away from the realm of the Human Resource Department, line managers and senior executives will find People, Performance, and Pay an invaluable reference for effectively using salary, incentives, and benefits to motivate and reward employees, improve quality, and increase productivity.

                        <p>While most businesses have been radically updating their notions of quality, service, customers and hierarchy, they have done nothing to modernize their pay philosophies or strategies for decades. The authors identify the four most common organizational work cultures, and explain how to align innovative pay policies with each type.

She spent her teenage years in sixties America after her mother remarried a GI and the family moved to Virginia. After a displaced adolescence, during which she saw her sister, Grace, die of eye cancer, Kelly threw herself into politics and cut her political teeth working on the campaigns of Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. She returned to Europe in 1970. Her extraordinary political passion, combined with lobbying skills and international contacts, ensured that she immediately shot to prominence within the emerging green and peace movements. Petra met Gert Bastian in the early eighties. Bastian was a NATO general, a war veteran who rocked the German establishment by joining protests against US nuclear weapons in Germany, then joined the Greens and fell in love with Petra Kelly. In this meticulously researched biography, Sara Parkin goes behind the public charisma of Petra Kelly to reveal the contradictions of her complex character, a woman at once sure of her vision but desperately insecure, wielding massive power in the outside world but wholly dependent in her intimate life."

Now, in Life Outside, Signorile offers an expose of what he calls the ""cult of masculinity"" within contemporary gay male culture, while at the same time he finds hope and renewal in life outside the urban centers - and also among people who consider themselves outside the ""scene"" within the urban centers. Drawing on illuminating and often heartbreaking first-person accounts of life on the ""circuit"" - the drug-fueled parties that dominate the ""scene"" and largely define the gay aesthetic - Life Outside shows the pressure that gay men are under to conform to an impossible physical ideal and how that pressure filters down, even to those far removed from the circuit. Few, he contends, are immune to the anxieties and insecurities that result from the promotion of this ideal. But Life Outside also identifies another, more positive phenomenon in the gay male world. For years life inside the gay urban centers has set the pace for life outside, but with the expansion of the gay movement has come a new visibility. With more and more gays coming out - and remaining - in suburban, small-town, and rural America, life outside the urban ""scene"" is changing the face of what it is to be gay in America.

And what was done to them. The calm with which the author describes the most appalling events and the most terrible ironies is uncanny. He never raises his voice, never embroiders language, never strives for effect. He merely tells these stories that must be told, in one unflinchingly pure, clear sentence after another.

<p>For more than half a century, the red leather diary lay silent, languishing inside a steamer trunk, its worn cover crumbling into little flakes. When a cleaning sweep of a New York City apartment building brings this lost treasure to light, both the diary and its owner are given a second life.</p>
<p>Recovered by Lily Koppel, a young writer working at the New York Times, the journal paints a vivid picture of 1930s New York–horseback riding in Central Park, summer excursions to the Catskills, and an obsession with a famous avant-garde actress.

As she turns the diary's brittle pages, Koppel is captivated by the headstrong young woman whose intimate thoughts and emotions fill the pale blue lines. Who was this lovely ingénue who adored the works of Baudelaire and Jane Austen, who was sexually curious beyond her years, who traveled to Rome, Paris, and London?</p>
<p>Compelled by the hopes and heartaches captured in the pages, Koppel sets out to find the diary's owner, her only clue the inscription on the frontispiece–""This book belongs to . . . Florence Wolfson."" A chance phone call from a private investigator leads Koppel to Florence, a ninety-year-old woman living with her husband of sixty-seven years.

Now, at last, he bares his soul and completes the history of this turbulent time. His very personal, anecdote-filled story takes us inside the highest levels of government and challenges our assumptions by telling us how President Reagan invited Wright into the Central American peace process and then denounced him when it began to work; Wright dealt with all the key players in the United States and Central America, and came to call many of them his friends; he helped stop the killing in Central America despite administration opposition; State Department officials and the Washington Times plotted to blame him for a classified leak; the lies of administration officials led Congress to reject executive branch policies; and a cabal of hardcore conservatives coordinated a vicious assault on Wright's reputation by accusing him of unethical - although never illegal - actions.

<p>Author Biography: <i>Betty Smith was born Elisabeth Wehner on December 15, 1896, the same</i> date as, although five years earlier than, her fictional heroine Francie Nolan. The daughter of German immigrants, she grew up poor in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the very world she re-creates with such meticulous detail in <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.</i>After marrying fellow Brooklynite George H.E. Smith, she moved with him to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was a law student at the University of Michigan. The young bride soon had two daughters, Nancy and Mary, and was forced to wait until the girls had entered grade school before endeavoring to complete her own formal education.Although she had not finished high school, the largely autodidactic Smith was permitted to take classes at the university, and she concentrated her studies there in journalism, drama, writing and literature. She capped her education by winning the Avery Hopkins Award for work in drama, and did a three-year course in playwriting at the Yale Drama School.After stints writing features for a Detroit newspaper, reading plays for the Federal Theatre Project, and acting in summer stock, Smith landed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina under the auspices of the W.P.A. She and her first husband divorced in 1938. In 1943, she married JoeJones, a writer, journalist, and associate editor of the <i>Chapel Hill Weekly,</i> while he was serving as a private in the wartime army. That same year, <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,</i> her first novel, was published.The prestige of writing a best-selling, critically lauded book brought assignments from the <i>New York Times Magazine,</i> for which she wrote both light-hearted and serious commentary. In a December 1943 piece called ""Why Brooklyn is that Way,"" Smith donned the mantle of her childhood borough's unofficial champion. Her perceptions at once encapsulate one of the core themes of her novel and answer some of her more urbane critics. ""Brooklyn is the small town — but on a gigantic scale — that the New Yorker ran away from,"" she wrote. ""In jeering at Brooklyn's mores and ideology, your New Yorker may be trying to exorcise his own small-town background.""Although most remembered for the phenomenal success of that first book, Smith wrote other novels, including <i>Tomorrow Will Be Better</i> (1947), <i>Maggie-Now</i> (1958), and <i>Joy in the Morning</i> (1963). She also had a long career as a dramatist, writing one-act and full-length plays for which she received both the Rockefeller Fellowship and the Dramatists Guild Fellowship. She died in 1972.</p>"

<p>Kevin Sweeney was three years old when his father died, and only vaguely aware of his family's circumstances. His mother, thirty-four and nearly penniless, would not speak of the loss to her six children, and they, mindful of her fragility, hid their grief. But five years later, Sweeney quietly selected three men from his community to be his role models. Seized by the notion that he would be a father one day, he carefully planned his education.</p>
<p>None of Sweeney's father figures knew of their surrogacy, even though Sweeney was often on the periphery of their lives. He basked in the attention they occasionally lavished on him at parties or basketball games. Haunted by his own anger, guilt, jealousy, and sadness, Sweeney found relief and inspiration in the men, and in the tight-knit suburb where his family lived. He enjoyed long days of exhilarating normalcy -- learning to hit curveballs, roving on Sting-Ray bikes, and concocting explosives with neighborhood compatriots.</p>
<p>Kevin Sweeney's memoir recalls a childhood of private longing in a community of almost otherworldly simplicity, a place where every neighborhood girl received a curbside ovation on her way to the prom. It is the story of a boy and the three men he wanted to be like when he grew up, men who would pull him, a son at last, to the safety of young adulthood. And it is a story of resiliency, with lessons for all of us about the needs of children, the gift of community, and the nature of fatherhood.</p>"

While pundits and political leaders publicly wring their hands about these alarming trends, most retire at the end of the day to their comfortable suburban homes, secure in the belief that it will never happen to their children. Armstrong Williams, a nationally-syndicated radio and television host, sets a higher standard for himself. Through his shows, and in his personal life as well, Armstrong lives his own rhetoric of individual empowerment, hard work, faith, and social responsibility. This book, Beyond Blame, is the direct result of a hard-headed dialogue with a young man he calls ""Brad Howard,"" a twenty-seven-year-old drug dealer, murderer, and father of three small daughters who, in his desperation to leave the streets behind, sought Armstrong's help. Armstrong, raised on a farm and more accustomed to Washington's corridors of power than to the urban ghetto culture, must first bridge the gap between his own world and Brad's - where women are mere playthings for the amusement of pimps and hustlers, where drug money pays for Caribbean vacations or the assassination of rivals, and where individual responsibility takes a back seat to hedonism. It's not enough, Armstrong exhorts Brad, simply to ""give up"" hustling. Instead, Brad must exorcise the world-view that allowed him to fall into degradation in the first place. The ethic of entitlement and false pride, hammered into young men and women by our educational institutions, popular culture, and political leaders, is only partially to blame for Brad's plight. For in the end, it was Brad's own decisions that led to his degenerate life - quite literally, Brad's finger was on the trigger. In order to do right, Armstrong maintains, you must learn to think right. Drawing on his own unapologetic Christianity, he provides l"

Nestled in one of the South's most strategically important locations, it was occupied by the Northern army, recaptured by the Confederacy, and finally ceded to the North. Told largely through the diaries, papers, and correspondence of residents, common infantrymen, and such eminent personalities as Robert E. Lee, Walt Whitman, Ulysses S. Grant, Clara Barton, and Stonewall Jackson, all of whom spent time in Culpeper, this story wonderfully captures both the intimacy and grandeur of war. Sutherland's account of the war is unlike any other. Both a military and a social history, it details the life of a single Confederate community without losing sight of the titanic struggle of a nation divided. It allows readers to join the councils of Lee and Grant while sharing the letters of young couples separated by war. We frolic with the fun-loving Jeb Stuart, experience the confused terror of men in battle, feel the anguish of civilians surrounded by contending armies, observe the tensions between neighbors with different loyalties, and sense the joy of liberated slaves.

You must get out now!"" Double agent Werner Stiller carefully began planning his escape to the West. His world would soon change forever: either he would leave his homeland - or he would die. In the exciting tradition of William Hood's Mole, Beyond the Wall is the true story of a disillusioned East German superspy driven by his conscience to turn double agent for the West. Werner Stiller was a naive young student recruited into the Ministry of State Security - the powerful Stasi - to acquire nuclear weapon secrets in Western Europe in the 1970s. Before long, he learned firsthand that the Stasi's powerful reach surpassed even the alarmists' most Kafkaesque fears and that the East German security forces constituted a vast, privileged underground world based on fear and intimidation. A smash bestseller in Germany, it reveals the actual tools and methods spies use to do their work. Beyond the Wall is both a concise, intelligent, and pointed account of the once all-powerful Stasi and a uniquely personal window into the real world of highly successful espionage."

9780029347133,"Restoration: Congress, Term Limits And The Recovery Of Deliberative Democracy",['George F. Will'],"The world's oldest democracy - ours - has an old tradition of skepticism about government. However, the degree of dismay about government today is perhaps unprecedented in our history. Americans are particularly convinced that Congress has become irresponsible, either unwilling or incapable of addressing the nation's problems - while it spends its time and our money on extending its members' careers. Many Americans have come to believe fundamental reform is needed, specifically limits on the number of terms legislators can serve. In Restoration, George Will makes a compelling case, drawn from our history and his close observance of Congress, that term limits are now necessary to revive the traditional values of classical republican government, to achieve the Founders' goal of deliberative democracy, and to restore Congress to competence and its rightful dignity as the First Branch of government. At stake, Will says, is the vitality of America's great promise self-government under representative institutions. At issue is the meaning of representation. The morality of representative government, Will argues, does not merely permit, it requires representatives to exercise independent judgment rather than merely execute instructions given by constituents. However, careerism, which is a consequence of the professionalization of politics, has made legislators servile and has made the national legislature incapable of rational, responsible behavior. Term limits would restore the constitutional space intended by the Founders, the healthy distance between the electors and the elected that is necessary for genuine deliberation about the public interest. Blending the political philosophy of the Founders with alarming facts about the behavior of legislative careerists, Restoration demonstrates how term limits, by altering the motives of legislators, can narrow the gap between the theory and the practice of American democracy.

                        <p>Pulitzer Prize winner/author Will now pens ""a biting, humorous and perceptivesifting of much of the sand that fouls the national political machinery"" (TheNew York Times Book Review).

Now, Theodore Bikel, Theo, as he calls himself, turns his voice to the telling of a truly compelling story: his own. Born in Austria, raised in Palestine, educated in England, and with a stellar career in the United States and around the world, Theo's autobiography is the story not only of his own life, but of our collective history of the past six decades, from the Third Reich to the birth of the state of Israel, the McCarthyite fifties and the struggles of the tumultuous sixties in America. All rendered in his uniquely eloquent, fiercely committed voice. It will surprise, delight, and shock you. A tale from a man you thought you knew: actor, activist, singer, writer.

They were the baby boom's first wave, the bumper crop of circa 1945 to 1952, who invested their fondest hopes, deepest dreams, and most poignant identity crises in rock &amp; roll, using the songs as a backdrop to their chosen succession of subcultures. It was an exotic and vocal crowd that stretched from Presley's Memphis to Dylan's MacDougal Street, from Monterey to Woodstock, and for a while it felt like a way to beat the odds and the system. But now that the system has grown up around all but the hardest-bitten boomers, has rock &amp; roll let its generation down? Or is it the other way around? Or are change and disillusionment just another part of the message? In this freewheeling account of rock &amp; roll's place in our national subconsciousness, prizewinning music journalist and novelist Bruce Pollock assembles a personal soundtrack album to the unmade movie musical biography of the baby boom. Pollock's unconventional recollections, ruminations, and digressions are laced with exclusive quotes from more than two dozen of rock's most fascinating characters, from Bo Diddley to Bruce Springsteen, and informed by his unique slant on more than 2,000 of the best - and best known - rock &amp; roll songs. Who in this generation will ever forget years like 1958, when ""That'll Be the Day"" and ""Teenager in Love"" and ""Yakety Yak"" let the average privileged white kid imagine becoming as fearless as the rough-edged figures who made the records... 1964, when Phil Ochs wrote about churches burning in Mississippi, and the Beatles arrived in New York with their portfolio of innocent love songs... 1967, when LSD was legal, Cher was still with Sonny, and Joplin and Hendrix signed with the major labels... 1972, when Roxy Music and David Bowie and Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" made sexual redefinition the flavor of the year... 1975, when baby boomers, experiencing their second"

<p>Now a clearly disoriented woman involved in a rush-hour hit-and-run claims to be the younger of the long-gone Bethany sisters. But her involuntary admission and subsequent attempt to stonewall investigators only deepens the mystery. Where has she been? Why has she waited so long to come forward? Could her abductor truly be a beloved Baltimore cop? There isn't a shred of evidence to support her story, and every lead she gives the police seems to be another dead end—a dying, incoherent man, a razed house, a missing grave, and a family that disintegrated long ago, torn apart not only by the crime but by the fissures the tragedy revealed in what appeared to be the perfect household.</p>

James and Russell Friedman of the Grief Recovery Institute, along with psychotherapist Dr. Leslie Landon Matthews, have created a cutting-edge volume that will help free children from the false idea that they ""shouldn't feel bad"" and will empower them with positive, effective methods of dealing with loss.</p>
<p>There are many life experiences that can produce feelings of grief in a child, everything from the death of a relative or a divorce, to more everyday experiences such as moving to a new neighborhood or losing a prized possession. Whatever the reason or the degree of severity, if a child you love is grieving, the guidelines examined in this thoughtful book can make a difference.</p>
<p> No matter what the journey involves, seeing hope return to a child makes it all worthwhile. That is the greatest gift you can give to a child you love.</p>"

9780044451617,London 2001,['Peter Hall'],"Twenty-five years ago Peter Hall published London 2000, a bold and imaginative book in which he argued for a new concept of strategic planning for London and its surrounding region. Just as the author predicted, the region has continued to grow and spread, so that it now<p>extends over the whole of South-East England and even some way beyond. London 2001 is a completely new sequel to the original book and it attempts to do for the London of the late 1980s what its predecessor did for the London of the early 1960s. The 1963 book, widely reviewed and</p><p>acclaimed, had a powerful catalytic effect. In quick succession there followed three major official studies; together they created a blueprint for just the multi-centred city-region that Hall had envisaged. But thence, regional planning went into retreat, and by 1983 a Thatcher</p><p>government could actually condemn it as a discredited notion of the 1960s. London 2001 asks what went wrong with the dream of the 1960s. It argues that the need for a strategic plan is just as urgent as it was then: perhaps more so. It systematically surveys the major planning problems</p><p>of this, Britain's most prosperous region: problems of congestion and overheating in some parts, coupled with economic collapse and deprivation in others. And it concludes with an imaginative vision of what the region, with proper strategic guidance, could become by the start of the</p><p>twenty-first century. Hall argues that history is about to repeat itself: just as in the early 1960s, regional planning, officially pronounced dead, is about to rise from the grave. The problems have never gone away and, as the newspapers and television remind us every day, they are</p><p>looming ever larger. London 2001 will surely play a crucial role in the rebirth, just as London 2000 did a quarter-century ago.</p>"

For undersea explorer Barry Clifford, the biggest prize of all would be to find the Adventure Galley, Kidd's legendary pirate ship. In the world of pirate archaeology, it was the Holy Grail. With the help of the Discovery Channel, Clifford fields an expedition that includes some of America's top experts in shipwreck recovery. Their goal is to find, identify, and possibly excavate the remains of history's most famous pirate ship. The search takes them to the exotic nation of Madagascar and a tiny island off its rocky coast known to historians as the model for Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. There, amid pirate graveyards, broken porcelain intended for a European royal family, and native rituals that include blood sacrifice, Clifford and his crew find far more than they bargained for. The island's murky harbor is filled with sunken pirate ships, making it difficult to single out the Adventure Galley, and the shores are teeming with people who want the expedition stopped. The team races to find the ship before dark forces expel it from the island -- forces motivated by the same resentment and greed that caused Kidd's downfall. Return to Treasure Island and the Search for Captain Kidd weaves together two exciting stories: the saga of Captain William Kidd, one of history's most baffling and mysterious figures, and Barry Clifford's obsessive quest to find perhaps the most notorious pirate ship of all time. The result is a tale of treasure and adventure that ends in death -- both Kidd's and, three hundred years later, that of a rival archaeologist who attempts to stop Clifford's expedition."

9780028810874,Witness to Annihilation : Surviving the Holocaust - a Memoir,['Samuel Drix'],"When the German Army captured Lwow in 1941, Poland's third-largest city contained a vibrant Jewish community of 160,000 people. Because the Final Solution began there so early, no other Jewish community of similar size came so close to complete eradication. In 1943, the region's SS chief proudly reported to Hitler that it had been cleansed of Jews; in fact, less than one half of one percent of Lwow's Jews survived the war. For the Jews of Lwow, there was no miracle, no Raoul Wallenberg, no Oskar Schindler. Mainly because so few lived through Lwow's nightmare, little has been written about it. Samuel Drix survived. A respected Lwow physician, he lost every member of his large and loving family to the Holocaust, including his young wife, his beloved two-year-old daughter, and almost all his friends. Somehow he endured nearly a year in the infamous Janowska concentration camp, helping his fellow prisoners stay alive. Miraculously, Drix escaped and hid out with the aid of a courageous Polish farm couple. Then the Red Army came, and the war ended. But peace only brought the Soviet brand of anti-Semitism. Homeless, sick, and broken, he contemplated suicide, until a woman's love gave him renewed hope. Drix began a new family - and in America, a new life. And, as a witness at war-crimes trials, he was instrumental in bringing Nazi killers to justice."
9780061234002,Freakonomics [revised And Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Everything,"['Steven D. Levitt', 'Stephen J. Dubner']","Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did <i>Roe v. Wade</i> have on violent crime?<br>
<br>
 These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br>
<br>
 Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br>
<br>
 What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br>
<br>
 <i>Freakonomics</i> establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But <i>Freakonomics</i> can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world."
9780028740096,Churchill: The Unruly Giant,['Norman Rose'],"Winston Churchill is without question one of the most important figures of the twentieth century. Famous as the bulldog who rallied his wavering and war-weary compatriots to lead the Allied resistance to Hitler, he will forever stand as Britain's savior. Unceremoniously thrown out of office after the war, he was considered brilliant, occasionally impolitic, but morally principled by his friends, and fearsome, opportunistic, and an unruly troublemaker by his enemies. For much of his long political career he was the most detested and mistrusted man in British public life. Yet when he retired he was acclaimed as the """"greatest Englishman of all time"". Norman Rose, the first historian to be granted access to the Churchill archives since the publication of Churchill's authorized biography, sets the record straight, combining a proper assessment of Churchill's achievements with a legitimate strand of revisionism.

                        <p>Rose provides the first fully informed and even-handed biography of Winston Churchill. In its balance and breadth, its sympathy and detachment, and its wide-ranging historical vision, this book has been rightly called a ""masterpiece"" (The Sunday Times). 30 photos.

9780060504199,Always Time To Die,['Elizabeth Lowell'],"With her trademark electrifying storytelling and razor-sharp tension, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell proves once again why she is one of today's top masters of suspense -- in a riveting tale of dark family secrets ready to explode with the devastating force of a Southwestern earthquake. 
<p>The powerful Quintrell family of New Mexico has spent decades in the public eye. Now the recent death of the clan's patriarch, a former U.S. senator, has placed his son, Governor Josh Quintrell, squarely in the spotlight as he prepares his run for the highest political office in the land. It is not a good time to be rattling skeletons in the family's closets.</p>
<p>Researching personal histories isn't just Carolina ""Carly"" May's profession, it's her passion. When the governor's eccentric Aunt Winifred invites Carly into the Quintrells' private Taos compound to compile a genealogical record of the illustrious residents, she can hardly believe her good luck. But digging into the past is raising troubling questions about the would-be president's private life, his late father and catatonic mother, and the grisly street crime that left his notorious drug-addicted sister dead. And it soon becomes frighteningly apparent that the motivation of the dotty old woman who hired Carly might be something more akin to revenge -- and that someone is determined to remove the inquisitive genealogist from the picture by any means necessary.</p>
<p>As a dark world of twisted passions and depraved crimes slowly opens up before Carly, she realizes that there is no one whom she dares to trust -- perhaps least of all Dan Duran, a dangerous and haunted mystery man who's somehow tied to the Quintrells' past. But she will need an ally to survive the terrible secrets a father carried to the grave and an even more devastating evil that lurks among the living -- because following the bloodlines of the wealthy and power-hungry can be a bloody business ... and some dead secrets can kill.</p>"
9780060512804,Cryptonomicon,"['Stephenson, Neal.']","With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century.
<p>In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse — mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy — is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Waterhouse and Detatchment 2702 — commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe — is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia — a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.</p>
<p>A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's mostaccomplished and affecting work to date.|</p>"

<p>The man who has remained silent for more than a decade finally speaks, revealing the gritty true story of his life inside the infamous South Boston Irish mob led by the elusive, Machiavellian kingpin Whitey Bulger, who to this day remains on the lam as one of the world's Ten Most Wanted criminals, second only to Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>John ""Red"" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James ""Whitey"" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA.</p>
<p>While Bulger's other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI's ""main man"" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time.</p>
<p>In <i>Rat Bastards</i>, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy.</p>
<p>Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.</p>"
