9781771239547,Back In Her Time,['Patricia Corbett Bowman'],"With freshly shaven head, black-garbed, tongue-studded, seventeen-year-old Taylor is standing by her high school locker in the Y2K years. Next minute, she finds herself in a slit trench in Italy next to her much younger grandfather. A glance around her makes it clear; she is in the middle of World War II!<br>
<br>
Confusion over how she got here is the least of her problems. Handed an Enfield rifle, she must join the Canadian army and fight the enemy. Feeling like an outcast, Taylor must forge relationships with her grandfather and the soldiers in her platoon to survive. Her grouchy grandfather/sergeant will be a challenge.<br>
<br>
Armed with some historical facts and her grandfather's vaguely remembered war stories, Taylor must convince her grandfather she is not a psychic or a mentally unbalanced soldier, but truly his granddaughter, who has arrived somehow from the future. And how will she get back to her own time?"

<p>Stunning foldout pages, panels, diagrams, photographs and ""Mega Facts"" boxes make this book a stimulating read for all ages. <b><i>Megastructures</i></b> describes how and why these structures were designed and built. It explains the physics behind the designs, which allows buildings, dams or bridges to rise to incredible heights, withstand enormous pressures, and resist collapse from environmental forces.</p>
<p>The book is organized into four sections.</p>
<p>Towering Giants: skyscrapers, towers, monuments, offshore platforms</p>
<ul>
<li>Burj Khalifa Skyscraper (gatefold) -- casts shadows on passing clouds</li>
<li>Troll A Gas Platform -- its legs weigh an astonishing 72,300 tons each</li>
<li>Pearl River Tower -- the first ""green""<br>
 skyscraper</li>
</ul>
<p>Gigantic Lengths: wide and long, over and under</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of bridges -- beam, arch, cantilever, suspension, cable-stayed</li>
<li>Öresund Link (gatefold) -- joins Denmark and Sweden</li>
<li>Gatthard Base Tunnel -- at 35 miles, the world's longest</li>
</ul>
<p>Massive Monsters and Darkest Depths: stadiums, islands, dams</p>
<ul>
<li>London's Olympic Stadium (gatefold) -- cut-away diagrams</li>
<li>Hoover Dam -- changing a river course</li>
<li>Palm Islands, Dubai -- palm-tree shaped artificial islands longest</li>
</ul>
<p>Darkest Depths: mines, power stations, ice cores</p>
<ul>
<li>Channel Tunnel (gatefold) -- a network of interlinking tunnels and passages</li>
<li>Thunder Horse Oil Field -- the deepest oil field ever found</li>
<li>Bingham Canyon Mine -- the world's deepest opencast mine longest</li>
</ul>
<p>In each chapter, <b><i>Megastructures</i></b> also looks at Failures and Accidents, including such frightening events as windows falling out, roofs collapsing, floods and explosions. Future chapters in each section describe the monsters of tomorrow, like the pickle-shaped Gherkin tower, the Lake Vostok tunnel deep under Antarctic ice and the Bering Bridge linking the USA and Russia.</p>

<p>In his first book for children, <b>When I Get Older</b>, Somali-Canadian poet, rapper, singer, and songwriter K’NAAN tells his own story. Born in Somalia, he grew up in Mogadishu. His grandfather was a renowned poet who passed on his love of words to his grandson. When the Somali Civil War began in 1991, K’NAAN was just thirteen. His mother made the difficult decision to move her family so that they could grow up in safety. First in New York and then in Toronto, K’NAAN faced many challenges.</p>
<p>Like so many other immigrants, he had to make a place for himself in a world of alien customs, clothes, and&nbsp;language. His road was a hard one: he lost many friends to violence. But K’NAAN’s love of music, and his enormous talent, became a way for him to connect with his past, with his classmates, and eventually, to millions of people around the world. Not only does K’NAAN tell a story that will inspire and encourage young readers, but he provides a brief history of the Somalian conflict. The lyrics of “Wavin’ Flag” are also included.</p>
<p>Born Keinan Abdi Warsame, K’NAAN first came to prominence when he performed a spoken word piece before the&nbsp;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1999. A member of the audience, the singer Youssou N’Dour, was so impressed that he asked K’NAAN to take part in an album and to tour with him.</p>
<p>Since then, K’NAAN has performed in more than 86 countries and has received many honors, including three Juno Awards and the BBC Radio 3 Award for World Music. During the Vancouver Olympics, he worked with other Canadian musicians and artists under the name Young Artists for Haiti to produce a charity version of “Wavin’ Flag.” The song was adapted again to become the FIFA World Cup theme song.

9781770461123,Rookie Yearbook One,['Tavi Gevinson'],"<p class=""null1"">The first print publication edited by Tavi Gevinson, the editor in chief of <i>Rookie</i>, the website for teenage girls</p>
<p>Tavi Gevinson started her personal blog, <i>Style Rookie</i> (http://www.thestylerookie.com), in 2008, when she was eleven years old. It was a place where, from the confines of her bedroom in the suburbs, she could write about personal style and chronicle the development of her own. Within two years, the blog was averaging fifty thousand hits per day. Soon fashion designers were flying her around the world to attend and write about fashion shows, and to be a guest of honor at their parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Tavi’s interests grew beyond fashion, into culture and art and, especially, feminism. In September 2011, when she was fifteen, she launched <i>Rookie</i> (http://rookiemag.com), a website for girls like her: teenagers who are interested in fashion and beauty but also in dissecting the culture around them through a uniquely teen-girl lens. Rookie broke one million page views within its first six days. <i>Rookie Yearbook One</i> collects articles, interviews, photo editorials, and illustrations from the highly praised and hugely popular online magazine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its first year, <i>Rookie</i> has established a large inclusive international community of avid readers. In addition to its fifty-plus regular writers, photographers, and illustrators (many of whom are teenage girls themselves), <i>Rookie</i>’s contributors and interviewees have included prominent makers of popular culture such as Lena Dunham, Miranda July, Joss Whedon, Jon Hamm, Zooey Deschanel, David Sedaris, Elle Fanning, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, John Waters, Chloe Sevigny, Liz Phair, Dan Savage, JD Samson, Ira Glass, Aubrey Plaza, Daniel Clowes, Carrie Brownstein, Paul Feig, Bethany Cosentino, Kimya Dawson, Fred Armisen, and Winnie Holzman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a young teenager, Gevinson couldn’t find what she was looking for in a teen magazine; <i>Rookie</i> is the one she created herself to fill that void. Her coolheaded intellect shines in <i>Rookie</i>, arguably the most intelligent magazine ever made for a teen-girl audience. Gevinson writes with a humble but keen authority on such serious topics as body image, self-esteem, and first encounters with street harassment. She’s equally deft at doling out useful advice, such as how to do a two-minute beehive, or how to deliver an effective bitchface. <i>Rookie</i>’s passionate staffers and faithful readers have helped make <i>Rookie</i> the strong community that it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, Gevinson has written for <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>, <i>Jezebel</i>, <i>Lula</i>, and <i>Pop</i>, and is a contributing editor for <i>Garage</i> magazine. She has been profiled in <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>, and has been on the cover of <i>Pop</i>, <i>L’Officiel</i>, <i>Zeit</i> <i>Magazin</i>, and <i>Bust</i>. As a speaker, she has made numerous presentations at venues such as IdeaCity, TEDxTeen, L2 Forum, and the <i>Economist</i> World in 2012 Festival. Last year Lady Gaga called her “the future of journalism.”</p>"

<p class=""null1"">""Engaging...[ Delisle] highlights the very complex lives of Israelis, Palestinians, and foreign residents.""—Publishers Weekly Starred Review</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guy Delisle expertly lays the groundwork for a cultural road map of contemporary Jerusalem, utilizing the classic stranger in a strange land point of view that made his other books, <i>Pyongyang, Shenzhen,</i> and <i>Burma Chronicles</i> required reading for understanding what daily life is like in cities few are able to travel to.&nbsp;In <i>Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City</i>, Delisle explores the complexities of a city that represents so much to so many. He eloquently examines the impact of the conflict on the lives of people on both sides of the wall while drolly recounting the quotidian: checkpoints, traffic jams, and holidays.&nbsp;When observing the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations that call Jerusalem home, Delisle’s drawn line is both sensitive and fair, assuming nothing and drawing everything. <i>Jerusalem</i> showcases once more Delisle’s mastery of the travelogue.</p>"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Hark! A Vagrant</i> is an uproarious romp through history and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist and comics sensation Kate Beaton. No era or tome emerges unscasthed as Beaton rightly skewers the Western world's revolutionaries, leaders, sycophants, and suffragists while equally honing her wit on the hapless heroes, heroines, and villains of the best-loved fiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is, of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture never gets old. <i>Hark! A Vagrant</i> features sexy Batman, the true stories behind classic <i>Nancy Drew</i> covers, and Queen Elizabeth doing the albatross. As the 500,000 unique monthly visitors to harkavagrant.com already know, no one turns the ironic absurdities of history and literature into comedic fodder as hilariously as Beaton.</p>"

<p>Teen outcast Andy is an orphaned nobody with only one friend, the obnoxious—but loyal—Louie. They roam school halls and city streets, invisible to everyone but bullies and tormentors, until the glorious day when Andy takes his first puff on a cigarette. That night he wakes, heart pounding, soaked in sweat, and finds himself suddenly overcome with the peculiar notion that he can do anything. Indeed, he can, and as he learns the extent of his new powers, he discovers a terrible and seductive gadget—a hideous compliment to his seething rage—that forever changes everything.</p>
<p><i>The Death-Ray</i> utilizes the classic staples of the superhero genre—origin, costume, ray gun, sidekick, fight scene—and reconfigures them in a story that is anything but morally simplistic. With subtle comedy, deft mastery, and an obvious affection for the bold pop-art exuberance of comic book design, Daniel Clowes delivers a contemporary meditation on the darkness of the human psyche.</p>"
9781770460478,Big Questions,['Anders Nilsen'],"<p>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of 2011, included on Amazon.com, <i>Publishers Weekly</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp; NPR’S Best Comics lists</p>
<p>A haunting postmodern fable, <i>Big Questions</i> is the magnum opus of Anders Nilsen, one of the brightest and most talented young cartoonists working today. This beautiful minimalist story, collected here for the first time, is the culmination of ten years and more than six hundred pages of work that details the metaphysical quandaries of the occupants of an endless plain, existing somewhere between a dream and a Russian steppe. A downed plane is thought to be a bird and the unexploded bomb that came from it is mistaken for a giant egg by the group of birds whose lives the story follows. The indifferent, stranded pilot is of great interest to the birds—some doggedly seek his approval, while others do quite the opposite, leading to tensions in the group. Nilsen seamlessly moves from humor to heartbreak. His distinctive, detailed line work is paired with plentiful white space and large, often frameless panels, conveying an ineffable sense of vulnerability and openness.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Questions</i> has roots in classic fables—the birds and snakes have more to say than their human counterparts, and there are hints of the hero’s journey, but here the easy moral that closes most fables is left open and ambiguous. Rather than lending its world meaning, Nilsen’s parable lets the questions wander where they will.</p>"

<p>Created in the late 1950s,<i>Black Blizzard</i> is Yoshihiro Tatsumi’s remarkable first full-length graphic novel and one of the first published examples of <i>Gekiga</i>. Tatsumi documented how his love for Mickey Spillane and hard-boiled crime novels led him to create this landmark genre of manga in his epic, critically acclaimed 2009 autobiography, <i>A Drifting Life</i>. With <i>Black Blizzard</i>, Tatsumi explores the dark underbelly of his working-class heroes that five decades later has made him one of the best-known Japanese cartoonists in North America.</p>
<p>Susumu Yamaji, a twenty-four-year-old pianist, is arrested formurder and ends up handcuffed to a career criminal on the train that will take them to prison. An avalanche derails the train and the criminal takes the opportunity to escape, dragging a reluctant Susumu with him into the blizzard raging outside. They flee into the mountains to an abandoned ranger station, where they take shelter from the storm. As they sit around the fire they built, Susumu relates how love drove him to become a murderer. A cinematic adventure story, <i>Black Blizzard</i> uncovers an unlikely love story and an even unlikelier friendship.</p>"

9781770410084,Mad Like Tesla: Underdog Inventors And Their Relentless Pursuit Of Clean Energy,['Tyler Hamilton'],"<p>A search for the contemporary Nikola Tesla—considered a mad scientist by his society for predicting global warming more than 100 years ago—fuels this analysis of climate issues, which introduces thinkers and inventors who are working to find possible ways out of the energy crisis. From Louis Michaud, a retired refinery engineer who claims we can harness the energy of man-made tornadoes, to a professor and a businessman who are running a company that genetically modifies algae so it can secrete ethanol naturally, these individuals and their unorthodox methods are profiled through first-person interviews, exposing the social, economic, financial, and personal barriers that prevent them from making an impact with their ideas. The existing state of green energy technologies, such as solar, wind, biofuels, smart grid, and energy storage, is also explored, creating a sense of hope against a backdrop of climate dread.</p>"

9781770400443,Bookkeepers' Bootcamp: Get A Grip On Accounting Basics (101 For Small Business),['Angie Mohr'],"“Bookkeeping can absolutely be the difference between bankruptcy and success” says Angie Mohr. “You can't know how your business is doing until you record it.” Bookkeepers’ Boot Camp is the first book in the Numbers 101 for Small Business series. It shows small business owners the essentials of record keeping, and why it's crucial to a business’s success to track financial data. The book gives business owners a greater understanding of the purpose and process of record keeping and a deeper understanding of their businesses. Mohr has helped hundreds of small business owners who didn't understand the importance of record keeping and always put it off until “later.” These business owners were almost literally buried under a pile of papers, overwhelmed by the immensity of the task at hand. Mohr shows business owners how to sort through the masses of information and paperwork, record what is important, and how to use that information to grow a business for success! Eighty percent of all small businesses started this year will be gone in 5 years. As Mohr says, starting a small business can be “like driving a car in a foreign country where you don't know what the road signs are telling you.” Numbers 101 for Small Business is a new series of easy-to-understand guides for small business owners, covering such topics as bookkeeping, analyzing and tracking financial information, starting a business, growing a business, and exiting a business. Using real life examples, Mohr teaches small business owners how to beat the odds and turn their ideas into successful, growing companies."

9781770223080,I Moved Your Cheese,['Darrel Bristow-Bovey'],"The problem with self-help books that litter the shelves of the bookstores and bedside tables of the nation is that they expect you to do all the work. You are required to read them, remember key words, perhaps even put their teachings into practice in everyday life. Not this self-help book. This is the self-help book for people who want to take no steps at all. This is the self-help book for people lying on the sofa. This book will tell you how to reap the rewards of being a better person without having to trouble yourself with the unnecessary burden of actually becoming better. Our pages have been treated with a revolutionary new formula that allows wisdom to pass directly from the page into the atmosphere, where it can be easily inhaled from a reclining position."

<p>In&nbsp;a compelling narrative based on eyewitness accounts, contemporary diaries, letters, and interviews, Craig Collie collects the stories of the many levels of devastation suffered on that fateful day in Nagasaki. The war was coming to an end at last. The people of Nagasaki knew this as they desperately tried to survive each day's shortages of food and warmth—ordinary people going about their lives as normally as they could manage. People like Nagai, the doctor who'd just been told he had leukemia; Father Tamaya, the Catholic priest who'd agreed to postpone a return to his rural parish; and Koichi, the tram driver. Because the bombing of Hiroshima had been so devastating and there was severe media censorship, they knew nothing of what had befallen that city except for unbelievable stories told by a few survivors who had just now arrived. Beyond Japan, forces they could never have imagined were mustering as the Americans prepared to drop their next atomic bomb on the armaments-manufacturing city of Kokura. Bad weather, however, sent the pilots and their terrible load to Nagasaki, where a group of 169 POWs&nbsp;were digging air-raid shelters and repairing bridges near what became the bomb's epicenter. And, above the heads of them all, the machinery of wartime politics stumbled on toward its catastrophic finale. This book&nbsp;comes as close as history will allow to being there when 80,000 people died as a result of the bomb, half of them&nbsp;instantaneously. The world had changed forever and the shock waves would ripple right up to the present day, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;continue to contemplate the terrible power of a nuclear future.</p>"

Juggling working from home and managing a family, and worrying about whether she'll have a future career, Sarah is now the mother of seven-year-old Zac and the unrelentingly naughty four-year-old Alex. While she's no longer changing nappies or carrying babies, she is contending with the next lot of parenting challenges that every mother will be able to relate to.</p>
<p>In her clear and engaging way, Sarah takes us on a journey through the challenges (and joys!) of raising children, using Buddhist teachings and principles to help her answer the eternal questions of mothers everywhere: Who am I? Who are my children? Where am I going? And how can I do my best by my children and myself? Writing from personal experience, and weaving in stories from other mothers throughout her narrative, Sarah shows us how spiritual and mindful parenting can help all mothers to be more open, attentive and content.</p>
<p>Sarah's first book, Buddhism for Mothers, has sold copies to many mothers who practise Buddhism as well as to those who've never opened a Buddhist book in their lives.<br>
</p>
<p><b>About the Author:</b><br>
Sarah is a mother of two young boys who tries to apply Buddhist teachings in her daily life. She is also the author of Buddhism for Mothers, which has sold in the United States, United Kingdom and been translated into four other languages to date. Since the children started school, Sarah is very pleased to report that she manages to meditate daily</p>"

Intrigued, she returns to Ireland. Setting off from the famous Rock of Cashel in County Tipperary, she travels through small towns and villages, across the beautiful Knockmealdown Mountains, to the town of Lismore with its spectacular castle where her family used to live, and then on to the fishing village of Ardmore in County Waterford. Battling the rain as she follows narrow country roads, little-used tracks, and overgrown paths, she traces the footsteps of St. Declan. From a day at a horse fair to climbing mountains and tracking down fairy forts, she captures perfectly the local characters and castles, miraculous wells and talking statues, the broken dreams and local legends. Stories of goddesses, ghosts, and fairies are intertwined with the eccentricities and daily lives of everyday people—this is a journey full of the surprises that only Ireland can offer.</p>"

Lucio Galletto grew up in Liguria—at the eastern end of the Riviera di Levante (coast of the rising sun). He didn't realize how special his region was until he fell in love with an Australian girl and traveled 12,000 kilometers to be with her. In 2008 Lucio, and writer David Dale, along with photographer Paul Green, returned to the birthplace of ravioli and pesto and wild-greens pie to investigate how the cooking of Lucio's region had evolved during his 25-year absence. They found a new breed of chefs, farmers, and fishermen adapting traditions to the environmental concerns of the 21st century. Still using the wonderful array of local herbs, vegetables, and seafood, they apply a lighter touch and a more adventurous spirit. In this stunningly photographed book, Lucio brings us the fruits of his travels—180 delicious recipes that respect the experience of the past and anticipate the demands of the future; dishes that are fun to cook, beautiful to look at, a pleasure to share, and kind to the body. And, importantly, that pay homage to the sunny Riviera di Levante from which Lucio's culinary journey began.

However, in this warm and witty tale of life in a foreign land, Rachael, somewhat to her own surprise, finds herself gradually creating a second home in Prague, complete with an eccentric and unlikely tribe of extended family and friends; and realizes along the way that while she's been striving so hard to become someone else, she has inadvertently grown to rather like the person she has always been.</p>"

9781741044898,Lonely Planet Signspotting: Absurd & Amusing Signs From Around The World,['Doug Lansky'],"<b>From The Publisher</b>
<p>As anyone who has spent time on the road knows, you often have to depend on signs...to navigate through a town, locate your hotel, even obey the law - a scary thought if you've ever come across any of the publicly posted absurdities that appear in this book. Signs about as easy to understand as a Swahili auctioneer (to a non-Swahili speaker) or as well-planned as the dance steps in a mosh pit with the help of signspotters around the globe, we've assembled a collection of some of the most unintentionally entertaining postings on the planet - we hope they confuse and amuse you!</p>
<p class=""null1"">From the Author</p>
<p>Signspotting is a visual tour through the 'Far Side' of travel -- a guide to the head-scratching public postings that dot the highways and byways around the world. As a longtime fan of Gary Larson's cartoons, the comical absurdity of these signs may have been what attracted me to start collecting them in the first place. The thing is, I never would have guessed that there's stuff out there stranger than what Larson dreamed up. It almost suggests that Larson didn't have such a delightfully warped mind after all -- he had just been out traveling. There's a part of you that wants to just laugh when you see these Monty Python-esque signs. And there's another more sensitive part saying, 'Wait a minute, these people are putting up signs as a favor to us. It's not their first language, they're doing their best, and we wouldn't do any better if we started putting up signs for tourists in other languages.' I figure that as long as we recognize that we would have all nationalities rolling in our streets with laugher if we attempted to be as thoughtful to them as they're trying to be to us, then there's no harm in enjoying the signs for what they are: side-splitting inadvertent comedy. Besides, some of the very best signs come from English-speaking countries where they should (in theory) know better. During the last four years, I have received well over 10,000 photos of funny signs. This book, you might say, is Signspotting's greatest hits collection. If you haven't seen these yet, you'll be amazed at what's decorating our planet.<br>
