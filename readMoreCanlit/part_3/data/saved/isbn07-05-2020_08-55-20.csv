Teaching At Home: A New Approach To Tutoring Children With Autism And Asperger Syndrome,['Olga Holland'],"""Faced with the apparent inability of her autistic son Billy to learn and socialize with other children at school, Olga Holland made the difficult decision to teach him at home. Where traditional educational approaches had produced limited results, the author's own method of teaching succeeded, over a period of two years, in enabling Billy to pass the ""Gifted and Talented Education"" test that allowed him to enter a class for gifted children."" ""Teaching at Home explains the author's approach to tutoring, focused on adapting to the demands of Billy's atypical mind and respecting his vivid imaginative world, while attracting and retaining his attention. The author describes her use of sensory and memory techniques, social stories and humor, and gives useful advice on issues such as understanding body language, adapting the teaching environment, devising homework schedules and coping with distractions."" Parents of children with autism or Asperger Syndrome who are considering homeschooling will find inspiration and encouragement in this account of Billy's impressive academic progress and development of social skills."
The Penelopiad (canongate Myths),['Margaret Atwood'],"""Homer's Odyssey is not the only version of the story. Mythic material was originally oral, and also local - a myth would be told one way in one place and quite differently in another. I have drawn on material other than the Odyssey, especially for the details of Penelope's parentage, her early life and marriage, and the scandalous rumors circulating about her. ""I've chosen to give the telling of the story to Penelope and to the twelve hanged maids. The maids form a chanting and singing Chorus which focuses on two questions that must pose themselves after any close reading of the Odyssey: What led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope really up to? The story as told in the Odyssey doesn't hold water: there are too many inconsistencies. I've always been haunted by the hanged maids; and, in The Penelopiad, so is Penelope herself."" - From Margaret Atwood's foreword to The Penelopiad"
Castles Of God: Fortified Religious Buildings Of The World,['Peter Harrison'],"""Peter Harrison's purpose is to show how and why religious establishments incorporated military architecture. He considers this unstudied subject from a uniquely wide point of view, historical, military, and architectural. Every form of religious building that received fortifications is illustrated, from the humble parish churches of the Anglo-Scottish Borders to the Potala Palace of the Dalai Lama and the Vatican."" Particular features of this book are the author's photographs, taken in some of the wildest and most inaccessible parts of the world, and his own very detailed plans and illustrations of many of the buildings described."
This Book Will Get You Laid,['Emma Dickens'],"""This Book Will Get You Laid"" takes the age-old dance between men and women and strips it down to its bare essentials - how to catch the eye of your chosen victim, sorry, loved one; how to make initial contact (or 'Moving in for the Kill'); foolproof mechanisms for persuading them to come back to your place; and, once there, how to make all their clothes fall off as if by accident. The rest is up to you..."
Yoga For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Step-by-step Guide For Parents And Caregivers,"['Dion Betts', 'Stacey W. Betts']","""This illustrated book draws on the authors' understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), and also their enthusiasm for yoga and the ways in which it can be used. It offers a range of gentle and fun yoga positions and breathing techniques that are effective in dealing with the increased levels of anxiety, disorientation and tactile sensitivity often found in children with ASDs. The authors give step-by-step descriptions of warming-up, strengthening, calming, and tension-releasing exercises that are suitable for reducing coping mechanisms, such as hand-flapping, and increasing muscle tone, muscle strength and body awareness. They also present a range of short and long sequences that can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual child."" Yoga for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders is ideal for parents and caregivers who want to use simple yoga techniques to help children with ASDs overcome some of the symptoms of the disorder."
The Language of Fashion,"['Roland Barthes', 'Michael Carter', 'Andy Stafford']","<br>Roland Barthes, widely regarded as one of the most perceptive critics of the twentieth century, was particularly fascinated by fashion and clothing.

Treasures Of China: The Glories Of The Kingdom Of The Dragon,['John Chinnery'],"<i>Treasures of China</i> presents a portrait of a country and civilization that has fascinated outsiders for millennia. From the mysterious Xia (ca. 2000bce) to the last imperial rulers, the Qing (1644–1912), the history of the greatest imperial power in East Asia unfolds in seven chapters illuminated by over 170 stunning photographs, from the Crucible of a Civilization through to Imperial Zenith and Decline. Each section balances informative background with illuminating commentary that explains not only the art forms (from the magnificent bronze-casting to sublime ceramics, exquisite jade carving to ornate laquerwork), but reveals the nature and significance of its rich symbolism. It makes for a fascinating account of imperial power, war and invasion, as well as a journey of discovery."
Gandhi: A Political Life,['Kathryn Tidrick'],"<p class=null1>A major reinterpretation of Gandhiâs life, politics, religion and nation</p><p>Throughout his long and turbulent career as an Indian leader, first in South Africa and then in India, Gandhi sought to fulfill his religious aspirations through politics, and to reconcile politics with his private religious discipline. The Gandhi revealed here is not the secular saint of popular renown, but a difficult and self-obsessed man driven by a sense of unique personal destiny.</p><p>Penetrating and provocative, Tidrick draws on material previously ignored by Gandhi's biographers and explores the paradoxes within his life and beliefs. Did the nationalist leader truly believe that he was not just fighting for Indian independence but also global enlightenment? Gandhi never admitted his early influences and experiences, but how important were the more esoteric ideas he first encountered in the West?</p>"
"10,000 Ways To Die: A Director's Take On The Spaghetti Western",['Alex Cox'],"<p>""40 years ago as a graduate student I wrote a book about Spaghetti Westerns, called <i>10,000 Ways to Die</i>. It’s an embarrassing tome when I look at it now: full of half-assed semiotics and other attenuated academic nonsense. In the intervening period I have had the interesting experience of being a film director. So now, when I watch these films, I’m looking at them from a different perspective. A professional perspective, maybe . . . I’m thinking about what the filmmakers intended, how they did that shot, how the director felt when his film was recut by the studio, and he was creatively and financially screwed. <i>10,000 Ways to Die</i> is an entirely new book about an under-studied subject, the Spaghetti Western, from a director’s POV. Not only have these films stood the test of time; some of them are very high art.""&nbsp; —<i>Alex Cox</i></p>"
Woman At Point Zero,['Nawal El Saadawi'],"<p>""All the men I did get to know, every single man of them, has filled me with but one desire: to lift my hand and bring it smashing down on his face. But because I am a woman I have never had the courage to lift my hand. And because I am a prostitute, I hid my fear under layers of make-up."" —Excerpt</p>
<p>This is a new edition of the best-selling novel with a specially commissioned new Foreword by Miriam Cooke.</p>


                        <p>""Saadawi writes with directness and passion, transforming the systematic brutalization of peasants and of women into powerful allegory.""--New York Times Book Review

The Invention of Paris: A History Told in Footsteps,"['Eric Hazan', 'David Fernbach']","<p><b><br>The Invention of Paris</b> is a tour through the streets and history of the French capital under the guidance of radical Parisian author and publisher Eric Hazan.</p><p>Hazan reveals a city whose squares echo with the riots, rebellions and revolutions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Combining the raconteurâs ear for a story with a historianâs command of the facts,<br>he introduces an incomparable cast of characters: the literati, the philosophers and the artists-Balzac, Baudelaire, Blanqui, Flaubert,<br>Hugo, Maney, and Proust, of course; but also Doisneau, Nerval and Rousseau.</p><p>It is a Paris dyed a deep red in its convictions.

The S Word: A Short History Of An American Tradition...socialism,['John Nichols'],"<p><b>A short, sharp, irreverent rejoinder to right-wing red-baiting.</b></p>
<p>A few months before the 2010 midterms, Newt Gingrich described the socialist infiltration of American government and media as “even more disturbing than the threats from foreign terrorists.” John Nichols offers an unapologetic retort to the return of red-baiting in American political life—arguing that socialism has a long, proud, American history. Tom Paine was enamored of early socialists, Horace Greeley employed Karl Marx as a correspondent, and Helen Keller was an avowed socialist. <b>The “S” Word</b> gives Americans back a crucial aspect of their past and makes a forthright case for socialist ideas today.</p>"

To Sea And Back,"['Shelton, Richard']","<p><b>Combining exquisite natural history with beguiling autobiographical and historical narrative,&nbsp;a portrait of a fish whose&nbsp;story is closely intertwined with our own</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlantic salmon is an extraordinary and mysterious fish. Here, Richard Shelton combines memoir and deep scientific knowledge to reveal, from the salmon's point of view, both the riverine and marine worlds in which it lives. He explores this iconic fish's journey to reach its feeding grounds in the northern oceans before making the return over thousands of miles to the&nbsp;brooks of its birth to reproduce. Along the way, Shelton describes the feats of exploration that gave us our first real understanding of the oceans, and shows how this iconic fish is a vital indicator of the health of our rivers and oceans. Above all,&nbsp;this is the story of Richard Shelton's lifelong passion for the sea and his attempt to solve the perennial enigmas of the salmon's secret life.</p>"
The Real Life Downton Abbey: How Life Was Really Lived In Stately Homes A Century Ago,['Jacky Hyams'],"<p><b>Fans of Julian Fellowes' hit show&nbsp;can step&nbsp;back&nbsp;100 years to the world of the pampered, privileged upper classes and take a look at exactly what goes on behind the magisterial doors of their favorite stately home</b>&nbsp;Using the characters and setting of the popular television show as a point of reference for the reader, this is a closer&nbsp;look at the Edwardian&nbsp;period. They were the super rich of their times, pampered beyond belief—the early 20th century Edwardian gentry, who lived like superstars, their every desire or need catered to by an army of&nbsp;butlers, servants, footmen, housekeepers, and grooms.&nbsp;Class, money, inheritance, luxury, and snobbery dominated every aspect of the lives of the upper crust Edwardian family.&nbsp;While below stairs the staff inhabited a completely different world, their very lives dependent on servicing the rich, pandering to their masters' every whim, and rubbing shoulders with wealth and privilege. While privy to the most intimate and darkest secrets of their masters, they&nbsp;faced ruin and shame if they ventured to make the smallest step outside the boundaries of their class-ridden world. From manners and morals to etiquette and style, this book opens the doors to the reality of the era behind&nbsp;TV's favorite stately home.</p>"
The Faith Of The Faithless: Experiments In Political Theology,"['Critchley, Simon , 1960-']","<p><b>Investigation into the dangerous interdependence of politics and religion.</b></p>
<p>The return to religion has perhaps become the dominant cliché of contemporary theory, which rarely offers anything more than an exaggerated echo of a political reality dominated by religious war. Somehow, the secular age seems to have been replaced by a new era, where political action flows directly from metaphysical conflict. <b>The Faith of the Faithless</b> asks how we might respond. Following Critchley’s <b>Infinitely Demanding</b>, this new book builds on its philosophical and political framework, also venturing into the questions of faith, love, religion and violence. Should we defend a version of secularism and quietly accept the slide into a form of theism—or is there another way?</p>
<p>From Rousseau’s politics and religion to the return to St. Paul in Taubes, Agamben and Badiou, via explorations of politics and original sin in the work of Schmitt and John Gray, Critchley examines whether there can be a faith of the faithless, a belief for unbelievers. Expanding on his debate with Slavoj Žižek, Critchley concludes with a meditation on the question of violence, and the limits of non-violence.</p>"

"Irregular Army: How The Us Military Recruited Neo-nazis, Gang Members, And Criminals To Fight The War On Terror",['Matt Kennard'],"<p><b>Reveals the US military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to extremists in its ranks.</b></p>
<p>Since the launch of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars—now the longest wars in American history—the US military has struggled to recruit troops. It has responded, as Matt Kennard’s explosive investigative report makes clear, by opening its doors to neo-Nazis, white supremacists, gang members, criminals of all stripes, the overweight, and the mentally ill. Based on several years of reporting, <b>Irregular Army</b> includes extensive interviews with extremist veterans and leaders of far-right hate groups—who spoke openly of their eagerness to have their followers acquire military training for a coming domestic race war. As a report commissioned by the Department of Defense itself put it, “Effectively, the military has a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy pertaining to extremism.”</p>
<p><b>Irregular Army</b> connects some of the War on Terror’s worst crimes to this opening-up of the US military. With millions of veterans now back in the US and domestic extremism on the rise, Kennard’s book is a stark warning about potential dangers facing Americans—from their own soldiers.</p>"

F: Hu Feng's Prison Years,['Mei Zhi'],"<p><strong>China's first literary dissident's Kafkaesque journey through the prisons of the Cultural Revolution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2013 English PEN Award winner</strong></p>
<p>Hu Feng, the ‘counterrevolutionary’ leader of a banned literary school, spent twenty-five years in the Chinese Communist Party’s prison system. But back in the Party’s early days, he was one of its best known literary theoreticians and critics—at least until factional infighting, and his short fuse, made him persona non grata among the establishment.</p>
<p>His wife, Mei Zhi, shared his incarceration for many years. <em>F</em> is her account of that time, beginning ten years after her and Hu Feng’s initial arrest. She herself was eventually released, after which she navigated the party’s Byzantine prison bureaucracy searching for his whereabouts. Having finally found him, she voluntarily returned to gaol to care for him in his rage and suffering, watching his descent into madness as the excesses of the Cultural Revolution took their toll.</p>
<p>Both an intimate portrait of Mei Zhi’s life with Hu Feng and a stark account of the prison system and life under Mao, <em>F</em> is at once beautiful and harrowing.</p>"
Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords And Their Godfathers,['Anabel Hernandez'],"<p><strong>Explosive, bestselling account of Mexico’s drug cartels and the government–business nexus that enables them.</strong></p>
<p>The product of five years of investigative reporting, the subject of intense national controversy, and the source of death threats that forced the National Human Rights Commission to assign two full-time bodyguards to Anabel Hernández, <em>The Lords of el Narco</em> has been a publishing and political sensation in Mexico.</p>
<p>The definitive history and anatomy of the drug cartels and the “war on drugs” that has cost more than 50,000 lives in just five years, the book explains in riveting detail how Mexico became a base for the mega-cartels of Latin America and one of the most violent places on the planet. Hernández reveals the complicity of Mexico’s government and business elite. At every turn, she names names—not just the <em>narcos</em> and their immediate accomplices, but also the politicians, policemen, functionaries, judges and entrepreneurs who have collaborated with them.</p>
<p>Hernández became a journalist after her father was kidnapped and killed and the police refused to investigate without a bribe. She gained national prominence in 2001 with her exposure of pharaonic spending on housekeeping at the presidential palace. All her previous books have also focused on corruption at the summit of power, under presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón.</p>"
"Film After Film: (or, What Became Of 21st Century Cinema?)",['J. Hoberman'],"<p><strong>How the digital turn and 9/11 have changed motion picture history.</strong></p>
<p>In this sly and thought-provoking volume, J. Hoberman turns an erudite eye to the study of twenty-first-century cinema and finds that, only a dozen years into the new millennium, the world of movies has already experienced a revolutionary transformation.</p>
<p>The advent of new digital technology has displaced the medium of photographic film—and, perhaps, the reality on which it once depended. With locations, sets and cameras now optional, the history of motion pictures has become the history of animation.</p>
<p>This sea change in filmmaking spanned the 2000 American presidential election and the trauma of 9/11, events that reshaped world politics and left an indelible imprint on the emerging aesthetic of the new century’s cinema. A rupture opened up in the evolution of film, presaging, as Susan Sontag forlornly predicted a few years earlier, the death of cinephilia, or at least cinephilia as we know it.</p>
<p>Witty and allusive, in the style of classic film theorist/critics such as André Bazin and Siegfried Kracauer, Film After Film expands on a much-discussed era-defining <em>Artforum</em> article by Hoberman before moving on to a chronicle of the Bush years in cinema (featuring reviews from Hoberman’s final decade at the <em>Village Voice</em>). The book concludes with considerations of the twenty-one central movies of the twenty-first century, which include works by Lars von Trier and Jia Zhangke as well as the hi-tech spectacles <em>WALL-E</em> and <em>Avatar</em>.</p>"

Instantly turning his attention to his appearance, he determines to transform himself into a suitable lover for a young girl.

All would seem to be well—until the new-look Major meets his son’s paramour.

The Greatest Album Covers Of All Time,"['Grant Scott', 'Barry Miles', 'Johnny Morgan']","<p>At a time when listeners increasingly download or upload songs, creating personal playlists on MP3 players and I-Pods, the art of packaging music seems to be fading away.

Pepper’s Lonely Heart Band</i>, for example—just one of the 500 memorable images in this amazing collection, all chosen by a panel of 50 experts and each accompanied by enlightening commentary. Among the choices: the brilliantly psychedelic and way-out art from the Rolling Stones’ <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>; Peter Tosh’s fiery cover for <i>Bush Doctor</i>; and the somewhat demented-looking prom queen on Hole’s <i>Live Through This</i> album.

"First As Tragedy, Then As Farce",['Slavoj Zizek'],"<p>Billions of dollars have been hastily poured into the global banking system in a frantic attempt at financial stabilization. So why has it not been possible to bring the same forces to bear in addressing world poverty and environmental crisis?</p>
<p>In this take-no-prisoners analysis, Slavoj Zizek frames the moral failures of the modern world in terms of the epoch-making events of the first decade of this century. What he finds is the old one-two punch of history: the jab of tragedy, the right hook of farce. In the attacks of 9/11 and the global credit crunch, liberalism dies twice: as a political doctrine and as an economic theory.</p>
<p><b>First as Tragedy, Then as Farce</b> is a call for the Left to reinvent itself in the light of our desperate historical situation. The time for liberal, moralistic blackmail is over.</p>"

"Dress Accessories, C. 1150- C. 1450 (medieval Finds From Excavations In London)","['Geoff Egan', 'Frances Pritchard']","<p>Brooches, rings, buckles, pendants, buttons, purses and other accessories were part of everyday dress in the middle ages. Over two thousand such items dating from the period 1150-1450 are described and discussed here, all found in recent archaeological excavations in London - then as now one of western Europe's most cosmopolitan cities, its social and economic activity compounded by the waterside bustle of the Thames. These finds constitute the most extensive and varied group of such accessories yet recovered in Britain, and their close dating and the scientific analysis carried out on them have been highly revealing. Important results published here for the first time show, for example, the popularity of shoddy, mass-produced items in base metals during the high middle ages and enable researchers to identify the varied products of rival traditions of manufacture mentioned in historical sources. Anyone needing accurate information on period costume will welcome this book, which will appeal to the general reader interested in costume and design, as well as to archaeologists and historians. THE AUTHORS are members of staff of the Museum of London.</p>"
Allen Brown's English Castles,['R. Allen Brown'],"<p>Castle studies have been shaped and defined over the past half-century by the work of R. Allen Brown. His classic English Castles, renamed here to acknowledge its definitive approach to the subject, has never been superseded by other more recent studies, and is still the foundation study of the English, and Welsh, castles built between the Norman Conquest and the mid 1500s. As the subject evolved, so too did this book, and for the most recent edition a considerable amount of French comparative material was added, though it remains essentially a study of English castles. For Allen Brown, castles were fortified residences (or residential fortresses), and developed, from European precursors, to support political and social realities as the Norman and Angevin kings secured their realm. Once these political ends had been largely met, the castle and castle-building entered a period of decline, and domestic and military interests went in opposite directions. This book, with numerous photographs and plans, remains the outstanding guide to the origins, purpose and identity of the great castles of England and Wales. R. ALLEN BROWN was also the author of The Normans, The Norman Conquest of England and The Normans and the Norman Conquest and founder of the Battle Conference on Anglo-Norman Studies, now in its twenty-sixth year.</p>"

Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle,"['Žižek, Slavoj']","<p>In order to render the strange logic of dreams, Freud quoted the old joke about the borrowed kettle: (1) I never borrowed a kettle from you, (2) I returned it to you unbroken, (3) the kettle was already broken when I got it from you. Such an enumeration of inconsistent arguments, of course, confirms exactly what it attempts to deny—that I returned a broken kettle to you ...</p>
<p>That same inconsistency, Zizek argues, characterized the justification of the attack on Iraq: A link between Saddam’s regime and al-Qaeda was transformed into the threat posed by the regime to the region, which was then further transformed into the threat posed to everyone (but the US and Britain especially) by weapons of mass destruction. When no significant weapons were found, we were treated to the same bizarre logic: OK, the two labs we found don’t really prove anything, but even if there are no WMD in Iraq, there are other good reasons to topple a tyrant like Saddam . . .</p>
<p>Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle analyzes the background that such inconsistent argumentation conceals and, simultaneously, cannot help but highlight: what were the actual ideological and political stakes of the attack on Iraq? In classic Zizekian style, it spares nothing and nobody, neither pathetically impotent pacifism nor hypocritical sympathy with the suffering of the Iraqi people.</p>

Smart Things To Know About Six Sigma,['Andrew Berger'],"<p>Six Sigma is a target for operational performance and the name originates from the statistical term that uses the lower case Greek letter to mean standard deviation. If you improve the sigma (or standard deviation) of any process you are in effect reducing failure or defect rate of that process. But don’t let this description put you off. Six Sigma has long left its precise definition behind. It has now turned into a generic term – one which denotes the disciplined and relentless pursuit of higher levels of quality and lower levels of cost. And with companies such as GE, Honeywell, Texas and Polaroid claiming to have delivered financial benefits of more than $1 billion it’s easy to see why Six Sigma is growing at a phenomenal rate - across all sectors and geographies.</p>
<p>In <i>Smart Things to Know about Six Sigma</i> Andrew Berger shows managers and execs how to bridge the gap between the theory and the practical applications of Six Sigma. Berger offers a unique and integrated approach combining best practice examples with a practical mechanism for implementation.</p>
<p>Smart managers know they can’t ignore the growing trend, and in <i>Smart Things to Know About Six Sigma</i> Andrew Berger reveals the tools for becoming a Six Sigma Black Belt:</p>
<p>What are the problems you could solve with Six Sigma? How do you select the right projects? How do you devise the timescale?</p>
<p>The main process for Six Sigma is DMAIC (Define – Measure &amp; Analyse – Improve – Control), and is the best methodology for ensuring that targets are met.</p>
<p>Time spent in reconnaissance is rarely wasted. Learn what the ‘Define’ and ‘Project Charter’ phase is. How do you get started?</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis is the art and the science of Six Sigma. What are the best practice tools and benchmarks to help project teams in the Measure and Analyse phase?</p>
<p>Next step. It’s time to move to the IMPROVE phase. No problem… this is when the fun begins. But what should the project team really want to achieve during this phase? It’s all about prioritising and testing solutions and building the case for change.</p>
<p>Change is only complete when people in the organization adopt a ‘new way of doing things’ as the accepted way of doing things. But what are the wider implications for taking on the change and how do you sustain the change? Welcome to the CONTROL phase.</p>
<p>How do you successfully manage Six Sigma change to deliver real financial benefits? (Hiieeeeyah. Please come forward and pick up your belt).</p>
<p>Six Sigma can be used to improve any process. From product cycle times to defects reduction, and it can be used in almost any range of business. From high street financial institutions, to hospitals and to cardboard box manufacturers. In the next 3-4 years, you’ll see around 60% of companies implementing some form of Six Sigma. Be Smart. And see what all the fuss is about…</p>

The Secret Language Of Churches & Cathedrals: Decoding The Sacred Symbolism Of Christianity's Holy Buildings,['Richard Stemp'],"<p>Thanks to books and films like <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> and its sequel, <i>Angels and Demons</i>, interest in secret religious symbols has never been greater. This carefully researched guide takes the reader into some of the world's most famous churches, decoding messages that are hidden in plain sight-in stained-glass windows, statuary, patterned flooring, ornamentation, and even the buildings' architectural design: Why do fierce beasts and grotesque faces peer from the walls? Who chose to depict one particular saint and not another? What's the significance of an eagle? A dragon? A pelican? No one who reads this book will ever again experience a visit to a cathedral in quite the same way.</p>"
Sex Pistols: The Graphic Novel,"['Jim Mccarthy', 'Steve Parkhouse']","<p>Thanks to Steve Parkhouse's wonderfully vivid illustrations and Jim McCarthy's clever distillation of the script that rewrote rock 'n roll and much else besides, the Pistols' story returns to the rough and tumble of the comic strip from which it derived to much of its initial inspiration.</p>
<p>England's original punks explode from the pages with the same disrespect for authority that had the British establishment up in arms during the Queen's 25th anniversary jubilee.</p>
<p>And no one would have enjoyed this take on the Pistols more than the tale's real casualty, Sid Vicious, who devoured comics almost as much as he did the destructive stuff.<br>

Studio Ghibli: The Films Of Hayao Miyazaki And Isao Takahata,"['Colin Odell', 'Michelle Le Blanc']","<p>The animations of Japan’s Studio Ghibli are amongst the highest regarded in the movie industry.

No other film studio, animation or otherwise, comes close to matching Ghibli for pure cinematic experience.

"The Gay Gospels: Good News For Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, And Transgendered People",['Keith Sharpe'],"<p>The place of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people in the Christian churches is a highly controversial issue. The stance of all the mainline churches is that homosexuality is sinful and incompatible with Christianity. In seeking to respond to attacks on their lives, identities and relationships LGBT Christians have moved over recent decades from a defensive position to a more affirmative position which asserts that there is evidence in the Bible and the Jesus tradition of validated homoerotic experience. This book presents a systematic overview of both the defensive and affirmative positions. In part one, The Defensive Testament, each of the so-called 'biblical texts of terror' used to demonise LGBT people is considered in turn and found wanting. None of them has anything to say about consensual same sex love. In part two, The Affirmative Testament, homoerotic elements in various Bible stories including the healing of the centurion's servant, Jesus and the beloved disciple, David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi are revealed to make visible the place of LGBT lives in the Biblical tradition. Taken together, these two testaments forcefully champion the equality of LGBT people in the Kingdom of God and represent a formidable challenge to ecclesiastical homophobia.</p>"

Hazel: A Life Of Lady Lavery 1880-1935,['Sinead McCoole'],"<p>Until now Lady Lavery has been remembered for the numerous portraits by her husband, the painter John Lavery, celebrated in ""The Municipal Gallery Re-visited' by W.B. Yeats, This first biography of Hazel tells the story the pictures cannot: ow a girl from boomtown Chicago became one of the most stylish society hostesses in London, and turned her husband's studio into a hub of Anglo-Irish diplomacy, from the 1921 Treaty negotiations through the tumultuous early years of the Irish Free State. Using hitherto-unpublished letters and scrapbooks assembled by Hazel herself, Sinead McCoole gives an intimate account of Hazel's artistic and political preoccupations, and of her extraordinary effect upon the male politicians of Ireland and Britain, for whom she and her salon often represented the only common ground.</p>

The Boys Of '67: Charlie Company's War In Vietnam (general Military),['Andrew Wiest'],"<p>When the 160 men of Charlie Company (4th Battalion/47th Infantry/9th ID) were drafted by the US Army in May 1966, they were part of the wave of conscription that would swell the American military to 80,000 combat troops in theater by the height of the war in 1968. In the spring of 1966, the war was still popular and the draftees of Charlie Company saw their service as a rite of passage. But by December 1967, when the company rotated home, only 30 men were not casualties—and they were among the first vets of the war to be spit on and harassed by war protestors as they arrived back the U.S.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In his new book, <i>The Boys of ’67</i>, Andy Wiest, the award-winning author of <i>Vietnam’s Forgotten Army</i> and <i>The Vietnam War 1956-1975</i>, examines the experiences of a company from the only division in the Vietnam era to train and deploy together in similar fashion to WWII’s famous 101st Airborne Division.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Wiest interviewed more than 50 officers and enlisted men who served with Charlie Company, including the surviving platoon leaders and both of the company’s commanders. (One of the platoon leaders, Lt Jack Benedick, lost both of his legs, but went on to become a champion skier.) In addition, he interviewed 15 family members of Charlie Company veterans, including wives, children, parents, and siblings. Wiest also had access to personal papers, collections of letters, a diary, an abundance of newspaper clippings, training notebooks, field manuals, condolence letters, and photographs from before, during, and after the conflict.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As Wiest shows, the fighting that Charlie Company saw in 1967 was nearly as bloody as many of the better publicized battles, including the infamous ‘Ia Drang’ and ‘Hamburger Hill.’ As a result, many of the surviving members of Charlie Company came home with what the military now recognizes as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder—a diagnosis that was not recognized until the late 1970s and was not widely treated until the 1980s. Only recently, after more than 40 years, have many members of Charlie Company achieved any real and sustained relief from their suffering.&nbsp;</p>"

Dali,['Eric Shanes'],"As a one of the foremost painters of the 20th century, Dalí, like Picasso and Warhol, can boast of having overturned the art of the previous century and directed contemporary art toward its present incarnation. As irrational as he was surrealist, this genius diver ted objects from their original meanings, plunging them into the acid of his constantly churning imagination. A megalomaniac and an artist who above all understood the force of marketing and publicity, Dalí disorients the viewer in order to draw him into the artist's world. On his canvases, images and colours crash together to express and mock certain ideas, creating a subversive eroticism that taps into the subconscious of the avid voyeurs that we are.<br>
The author, Eric Shanes, explores the twists and turns of Dalí's mad genius, commenting on the masterpieces of the painter so as to show the diversity and scope of his talent, leaving the reader blown away and bewitched by this Prince of Metamorphosis. This work opens up the sweet, mad universe of this megalomaniac genius and invites us to let ourselves be overcome . . . Dalí is, first and foremost, an absolute."

Fiesta Femenina: Celebrating Women In Mexican Folktale,['Mary-joan Gerson'],"Deep in the lush Mexican forests, amidst the tall mountains and the rushing rivers, dwells a great goddess.

Amerikanischer Realismus (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Der Amerikanische Realismus ist weder eine Kunstbewegung noch eine Schule, vielmehr ist er ein durch eine ausergewöhnliche Vielfalt gekennzeichnetes Phänomen, das nur schwer zu definieren ist. Er wird oft als der erste eigene Kunststil der USA betrachtet und zerfällt in eine Reihe von Kategorien, etwa den aregionalen Realismus"", den Genre-Realismus oder auch den Porträt-Realismus, je nach Ort, Sujet und Modell. So könnte sich ein Maler, der die indianischen Ureinwohner im Westen der USA oder die Seeleute an der Ostküste porträtiert, durchaus als Vertreter des Regionalen<br>
Porträt-Realismus bezeichnen.<br>
Eine einheitliche Auffassung des Amerikanischen Realismus ist daher kaum möglich. Doch unbesehen aller Unterschiede gibt es eine frappierende Gemeinsamkeit der ihm zugeordneten Künstler: ihr Anliegen, der typisch amerikanischen Lebensart (dem American Way of Life) sowie ihrem Verständnis von Freiheit Ausdruck zu verleihen. Natürlich hängt das Ergebnis der Bemühungen jedes Einzelnen von seinem subjektiven Empfinden, seiner individuellen Wahrnehmung, seinem Intellekt, seinem familiären Hintergrund, seiner Erziehung und Ausbildung ab und nicht zuletzt auch von regionalen und ethnischen Einflüssen. Das Spektrum dieser heterogenen Kunst reicht von Winslow Homers poetisch angehauchten Aquarellen aus den 1860er Jahren über die fast unheimlich und stark symbolträchtig wirkenden Bilder eines Andrew Wyeth bis hin zu den in melancholisches Licht getauchten Szenen eines Edward Hopper der 50er und 60er Jahre des 20. Jahrhunderts.<br>
Dieser Band präsentiert ein über hundert Jahre umfassendes Kaleidoskop des Amerikanischen Realismus. Den Anfang machen US-amerikanische Maler, die noch stark der Tradition der europäischen Kunst verpflichtet sind und sich allmählich von dieser lossagen; am Ende haben wir die Vertreter der modernen Generation, deren auf amerikanischem Boden gewachsene schöpferische und teilweise rebellische Ideen auch in Europa groses Aufsehen erregen und die ihre Eigenständigkeit als eine Art neue Pioniere beweisen.<br>"
Fra Angelico (pageperfect Nook Book),['Stephan Beissel'],"Der Maler Fra Angelico hat als einer der ersten die von dem<br>
italienischen Künstler, Gelehrten und Humanisten Leon<br>
Battista Alberti propagierte Technik der Perspektive<br>
angewandt. Seine Methode der Darstellung der Bewegung<br>
und sein Einsatz von Farbe und Gesichtsausdruck, um<br>
Anmut und Gefühl zu betonen, ordnen ihn in die Reihe der<br>
wichtigsten Maler der Frührenaissance ein. Mit Hilfe einer<br>
Reihe grosartiger Illustrationen und einer künstlerischen<br>
und biographischen Untersuchung enthüllt Stephan Beissel<br>
das Talent dieses ausergewöhnlichen Künstlers, der als<br>
Einziger wusste, wie man ,,die christliche Seele"" malt und<br>

Malraux als denjenigen Maler ansah, der die Grenze<br>
zwischen der sakralen Kunst des Mittelalters und der neuen<br>
Kunst der Renaissance markiert."
Michelangelo (pageperfect Nook Book),['EugÃ¨ne MÃ¼ntz'],"Der Name Michelangelo ist verbunden mit monumentalen Werken wie der Sixtinischen Kapelle, dem David, der Pietà und unzähligen anderen. Der französische Schriftsteller Stendhal bemerkte in seiner Geschichte der italienischen Malerei, dass azwischen der griechischen Antike und Michelangelo nichts existiert als mehr oder weniger begabte Nachahmungen"". Das Opus Michelangelos hat unfraglich die Prüfung der Zeit überstanden, aber wie war es möglich, dass er in wenigen Jahren künstlerische Geheimnisse aufdeckte, die seinen antiken Vorfahren in nichts nachstanden?<br>
Als kreatives Genie und Übermensch war Michelangelo ein unvergleichlicher Künstler der italienischen Renaissance und er wird aufgrund seiner Errungenschaften sowie seines Einflusses vollkommen zu Recht an die Seite Leonardo da Vincis gestellt. Dieses Buch versammelt Michelangelos beeindruckendsten Werke in einem praktischen Format und ist so das ideale Geschenk für alle Kunstliebhaber."

Frida Kahlo (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Detrás de los retratos de Frida Kahlo se ocultan tanto la historia de su vida como la de su obra. Es precisamente esta combinación la que atrae al espectador. La obra de Frida es un testimonio de su vida. Pocas veces se puede aprender tanto acerca de un artista con sólo contemplar lo que él inscribe dentro del marco de sus cuadros. Frida Kahlo es sin lugar a dudas la ofrenda de México a la historia del arte. Tenía apenas dieciocho años cuando un terrible accidente cambió su vida para siempre, dejándola discapacitada y agobiada de un dolor físico permanente. Pero su carácter explosivo, su férrea determinación y su inquebrantable ahínco la ayudaron a formar su talento artístico.<br>
<br>
A su lado estuvo siempre el gran pintor y muralista mexicano Diego Rivera, cuyo obsesivo donjuanismo no le impidió a Frida conquistarlo con sus encantos, su talento y su inteligencia. Ella aprendió rápidamente a aprovechar el éxito de su compañero para explorar el mundo, creando así su propio legado y rodeándose con gran esmero de un muy estrecho grupo de amigos. Su vida personal fue turbulenta: muchas veces dejó de lado su relación con Diego mientras cultivaba sus relaciones amorosas con personas de ambos sexos. Pese a esto, Frida y Diego lograron salvar su deteriorado idilio. La historia y las pinturas que Frida nos dejó revelan el valiente relato de una mujer en constante búsqueda de sí misma."
Lempicka (pageperfect Nook Book),['Patrick Bade'],"Die Portraits, Akte und Stillleben von Tamara Lempicka (1898-<br>
1980) atmen den Geist des Art Deco und des Jazz Age. Sie spiegeln<br>

Ihre Kunst kombiniert eine hervorragende klassische Technik mit<br>
Elementen aus dem Kubismus. Lempickas Schaffen ist der<br>

Virgin Portraits (pageperfect Nook Book),['Klaus Carl'],"During the Renaissance, Italian painters would traditionally depict the wives of their patrons as Madonnas, often rendering them more beautiful than they actually were. Over centuries in religious paintings, the Madonna has been presented as the clement and protective mother of God. However, with the passing of time, Mary gradually lost some of her spiritual characteristics and became more mortal and accessible to human sentiments. Virgin Portraits illuminates this evolution and contains impressive works by Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rubens, Fouquet, Dalí, and Kahlo."
Egon Schiele (pageperfect Nook Book),['Jeanette Zwingenberger'],"Egon Schiele (1890-1918) ist einer der grosen Maler des Expressionismus. Von Gustav Klimt unterrichtet brach er, wie seine Vorgänger der Wiener Secession, schon früh mit den Traditionen österreichischer Kunst. In seinen zahlreichen Selbstporträts und Aktmalereien bewahrte Schiele stets seine erotische und sinnliche, aber auch qualvolle Kunstvorstellung. Die Texte und Bilder in dieser Great Masters-Ausgabe zeigen das ausergewöhnliche Talent eines Künstlers, der unglücklicherweise bereits im Alter von 28 Jahren an Krankheit verstarb."
Antoni Gaudí (pageperfect Nook Book),['Jeremy Roe'],"El libro lleva a cabo un análisis crítico de la arquitectura de Antoni Gaudí, de acuerdo con las últimas investigaciones académicas, e incluye ilustraciones documentales y un ensayo fotográfico de su trabajo. Los dos primeros capítulos ofrecen una introducción a la vida de Gaudí y al contexto sociocultural de la Barcelona en la que desarrolló su extraordinario y original estilo. Los siguientes cuatro capítulos ofrecen un estudio pormenorizado de su trabajo. Los dos primeros hacen un seguimiento del desarrollo de Gaudí como arquitecto en función de sus aportes a dos áreas de la arquitectura. En primer lugar, sus obras seculares y domésticas, como la excepcional Casa Milà, y, en segundo lugar, sus diseños y edificaciones completas para la Iglesia, entre las que se incluyen el palacio episcopal de Astorga. Los dos últimos capítulos ofrecen una visión de la obra de Gaudí a lo largo de gran parte de su vida, pero se centran en los edificios construidos bajo el impulso de su mecenas, Eusebi Güell, por un lado, y en la monumental iglesia de la Sagrada Familia, célebre en todo el mundo. Asimismo, se ofrece un análisis crítico de todos sus edificios para poder identificar el desarrollo de su característico estilo arquitectónico."
Pablo Picasso (pageperfect Nook Book),['Victoria Charles'],"Este libro contiene numerosas obras creadas por Picasso entre 1881 y 1914. El primer estilo del artista está marcado por la influencia de El Greco, Munch y Toulouse-Lautrec, quien lo descubrió cuando aún era un estudiante en Barcelona. Picasso, fascinado por la expresión psicológica durante su Período Azul (1901-1904), manifestó una miseria moral: sus escenas de género, naturalezas muertas y retratos están impregnados de melancolía. La pasión de Picasso luego se volcó a las figuras de acróbatas: el Período Circo.<br>
Desde 1904, la fecha de su llegada a París, su estética evolucionó considerablemente. La influencia de Cézanne y las esculturas ibéricas lo condujeron hacia el cubismo, caracterizado por la multiplicación de los puntos de vista sobre los planos de la pintura. Además de la selección de las primeras pinturas de Picasso, este libro presenta numerosos dibujos, esculturas y fotografías."
Me And My Cat,['Carmel Reilly'],"Every cat owner believes that his or her cat understands every word that they say. Every cat owner believes that cats are far more intelligent than dogs - they're just too cool to show it. Every cat owner believes that their cat should be on TV starring in advertisements for everything from furniture and carpets to central heating and, yes, cat food. And those Andrex puppies have had it their own way for far too long... Every cat owner, in fact, is a cat lover. If they're not cat lovers when the cat first comes along - you don't purchase a cat, they choose to live with you - then they will be within a very short space of time. There are stories, of course, that every cat owner loves to tell. It may be that the cat became hugely and unusually distressed the day a relative died unexpectedly on the other side of town. It may be about how the cat is a constant source of comfort during bad times, or how the cat faces up to urban foxes in the garden. It may simply be a story about how the cat is a loving companion. Cat lovers simply love telling cat stories!"

Viet Cong And Nva Tunnels And Fortifications Of The Vietnam War,"['Gordon Rottman', 'Lee Ray', 'Chris Taylor']","Field fortifications and tunnel systems are typically thought of as defensive and active protective measures, but the VC/NVA also employed them offensively. It was common for extensive field works to be constructed to support assaults and sieges on US fire-support bases and remote camps. Their tactics reflected attempts to counter the massive firepower they faced: when directly engaging the enemy they employed “hugging” tactics (moving in and remaining closely engaged, even intermingling units, to prevent the enemy from bringing his artillery and close air support to bear). Their field works included defended villages, base camps, fortified complexes, hilltop defenses, trench systems, individual fighting positions, crew-served weapon positions, bunkers, caches, and extensive tunnel systems. Camouflage and deceptive measures, and the employment of obstacles and booby traps went hand-in-hand with such field works. This book examines these unique fortifications."
Angel Confidential,['Mike Ripley'],"Fitzroy Maclean Angelâs latest hair-raising adventure involves a dubious religious cult, an impoverished minor aristocrat with a love of classic cars and a very shady solicitor with an extremely odd wife. Not only that, but he also has to cope with rookie private eye Veronica Blugden, find out why her office is being vandalised, and discover what his bike-riding friend Crimson is up to, selling all that mysterious white powder... Complete with a new, specially-written introduction by the author."

Byzantine Art (pageperfect Nook Book),['Charles Bayet'],"For more than a millennium, from its creation in 330 CE until its fall in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was a cradle of artistic effervescence that is only beginning to be rediscovered. Endowed with the rich heritage of Roman, Eastern, and Christian cultures, Byzantine artists developed an architectural and pictorial tradition, marked by symbolism, whose influence extended far beyond the borders of the Empire. Today, Italy, North Africa, and the Near East preserve the vestiges of this sophisticated artistic tradition, with all of its mystical and luminous beauty. The magnificence of the palaces, churches, paintings, enamels, ceramics, and mosaics from this civilisation guarantees Byzantine art's powerful influence and timelessness."

Remington (pageperfect Nook Book),['Frederic Remington'],"Frederic Remington (1861-1909) was one of the last American artists to offer his contemporaries a vision of the American Old West, that wild terrain with its immense prairies, herds of bison and the last American Indians. A painter, but above all an illustrator popular in his time, Remington skilfully captivated the public's attention by presenting a realistic view of this primitive way of life on the brink of submitting to invading civilisation. Authentically capturing its roughness, force and also its colours, Remington quickly became the representative of American painting in the eyes of the world. Though he mainly concentrated on the attitudes of his characters and animals and not on his landscapes, his photographic style, with a nearly impressionist touch, renewed a genre and lent an added realism to his subjects. <br>
Painter and sculptor, Remington also knew how to sculpturally express the ardour of these strong men and wild animals battling with the evolution of a new continent. The galloping horse, still recognized today as his signature subject, magnificently illustrates the power of freedom emanating from these masterpieces."
Kahlo (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Frida Kahlos Portraits erzählen die Geschichte ihres Lebens - ein Werk, das aus Klagen der Wut und Verzweiflung entstand und sich mit einer kraftvollen und künstlerisch einzigartigen Schaffenskraft verbindet. Schon im Alter von sechs Jahren erkrankte Kahlo an Kinderlähmung und mit 18 Jahren sollte ein folgenschwerer Busunfall ihr Leben für immer verändern. Sie trug bleibende körperliche Schäden davon und litt für den Rest ihres Lebens an fortwährenden Schmerzen. Nur ihrem explosiven Charakter, ihrer unbeirrbaren Bestimmtheit und harten Arbeit ist die Entwicklung ihres künstlerischen Talents zu verdanken.<br>
Frida Kahlo gelang es, sich selbst einen Freiraum in der chauvinistischen Gesellschaft Mexikos zu schaffen, und dies, trotz ihres zweifachen Nachteils: körperliche Behinderung und weibliches Geschlecht. Ihr Werk hat heute, aufgrund seiner Innovativität und seiner multikulturellen Werte, eine grose Bedeutung im kulturellen Erbe ihrer Heimat Mexiko. Ihr Leben und die Bilder, die Kahlo schuf, offenbaren die einzigartige Geschichte einer couragierten Frau auf der langen Reise zu sich selbst."

O'keeffe (pageperfect Nook Book),['Gerry Souter'],"Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) zählt zu den bekanntesten US-amerikanischen Malerinnen des 20. Jahrhunderts. Zwischen ihrer Geburt und ihrem Tod spielte sich die gesamte Geschichte der Moderne in den Vereinigten Staaten wie in einem Hollywoodfilm ab. In einer Epoche, in der Frauen für eine Rolle als Ehefrau und Mutter bestimmt waren, widersetzte sich Georgia O'Keeffe den Konventionen und wurde gleichzeitig die Ehefrau von Alfred Stieglitz, berühmter Fotograf und charismatische Figur in der Entwicklung des modernen Amerika. Motive ihrer an der Grenze zur gegenstandslosen Malerei angesiedelten und als Interpretation der Welt in weiblicher Begrifflichkeit verstandenen Werke sind häufig Blumen, Flammen und später auch Stadtansichten, Wüstenlandschaften oder Knochen. Zugleich wird in den reinen Bildlandschaften O'Keeffes eine erotische Ausstrahlung wahrgenommen. Der Autor zeichnet hier sowohl den persönlichen Lebensweg einer modernen Frau als auch die Entwicklung ihres Schaffensprozesses nach. Dabei begnügt er sich nicht damit, die persönlichen Erfahrungen heranzuziehen, welche die Künstlerin geformt haben, sondern er bezieht zudem auch ihren künstlerischen Nachlass mit ein und berücksichtigt auserdem den in neuerer Zeit erforschten Zusammenhang von Weiblichkeit und künstlerischem Schaffen."

Gothic Art (PagePerfect NOOK Book),"['Victoria Charles', 'Klaus Carl']","Gothic art finds its roots in the powerful architecture of the cathedrals of northern France. It is a medieval art movement that evolved throughout Europe over more than 200 years.<br>Leaving curved Roman forms behind, the architects started using flying buttresses and pointed arches to open up cathedrals to daylight. A period of great economic and social change, the Gothic era also saw the development of a new iconography celebrating the Holy Mary - in drastic contrast to the fearful themes of dark Roman times. Full of rich changes in all of the various art forms (architecture, sculpture, painting, etc.), Gothic art paved the way for the Italian Renaissance and International Gothic movement."

Icons (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nikodim Pavlovich Kondakov'],"Icon painting has reached its zenith in Ukraine between the 11th and 18th centuries. This art is appealing because of its great openness to other influences - the obedience to the rules of Orthodox Christianity in its early stages, the borrowing from Roman heritage or later to the Western breakthroughs - combined with a never compromised assertion of a distinctly Slavic soul and identity.<br>
This book presents a handpicked and representative selection of works from the 11th century to the late Baroque period."

heute aber aufgrund des seine Porträts prägenden perfekten<br>
Gleichgewichts aus Realismus und Idealisierung als einer der<br>

The Portrait Of Mr W.h,"['Wilde, Oscar , 1854-1900']","In 1609, the first edition of Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i> was published, featuring the mysterious dedication: “To Mr W.H.” Ever since, the identity of Mr W.H. has been the subject of a series of fascinating theories—but none quite so ingenious as that of Oscar Wilde’s <i>The Portrait of Mr W.H.</i> Cambridge scholar Cyril Graham spent his days performing in Shakespeare’s plays, and, being somewhat effeminate in nature, he was cast in the female roles. And then he made a rather startling discovery—the “Mr W.H.” to whom Shakespeare dedicated his Sonnets could be none other than Will Hughes, the boy-actor of Shakespeare’s plays! But when no one shares his conviction, he resolves to find another way to convince them."
The Nva And Viet Cong,"['Kenneth Conboy', 'Simon McCouaig']","In 1940 Japan placed Vietnam under military occupation, restricting the local French administration to a figurehead authority.

This text details the history, organisation and uniforms of the People's Army of Vietnam from its origins in the fight against colonialism, through two separate wars against the US and Khmer Rouge, to its role in the modern era."

Con sus composiciones rigurosas, Van Dyck dotaba a sus modelos de dignidad, grandeza y espiritualidad. Damas orgullosas, señores retozando con sus caballos: Van Dyck sabía cómo representar la elegancia indiferente y el tedio de una sociedad refinada.<br>
<br>
Fue un pintor barroco con un estilo reluciente, jugaba con una paleta clara y matizada, y reproducía las prendas más virtuosas: el terciopelo, el raso y la seda.<br>
<br>
Van Dyck es considerado el fundador de la escuela inglesa de pintura de retratos. Ejerció influencia sobre Lely, Dobson, Kneller, y en especial Reynolds y Gainsborough, así como también sobre pintores franceses del siglo XVIII."
"A Shot Of Magick (magick Men, Book One)",['Rhyannon Byrd'],"Lachlan McKendrick possesses a renowned sexual prowess impressive among even his own kind.

Cubism (pageperfect Nook Book),"['Guillaume Apollinaire', 'Dorothea Eimert']","Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: five young women that changed modern art forever. Faces seen simultaneously from the front and in profile, angular bodies whose once voluptuous feminine forms disappear behind asymmetric lines - with this work, Picasso revolutionised the entire history of painting. Cubism was thus born in 1907. Transforming natural forms into cylinders and cubes, painters like Juan Gris and Robert Delaunay, led by Braque and Picasso, imposed a new vision upon the world that was in total opposition to the principles of the Impressionists. Largely diffused in Europe, Cubism developed rapidly in successive phases that brought art history to all the richness of the 20th century: from the futurism of Boccioni to the abstraction of Kandinsky, from the suprematism of Malevich to the constructivism of Tatlin.<br>
Linking the core text of Guillaume Apollinaire with the studies of Dr. Dorothea Eimert, this work offers a new interpretation of modernity's crucial moment, and permits the reader to rediscover, through their biographies, the principal representatives of the movement."
Angel City,['Mike Ripley'],"London in the early 1990s; supposedly the New Age ‘Caring Nineties’. But the streets, it turns out, are not paved with gold, but covered with the homeless living in leeping-bags and cardboard boxes, and often littered with a far more dangerous form of flotsam. For Angel, the city divides into several layers of underworlds and sub-cultures: callous crime and corruption, the growing drug culture, the seedier side of the gay scene, the young and homeless. There is also a more literal underworld where the role-playing game of Dungeons and Dragons can shift from fantasy to real violence at the flick of a wizard’s wand … But most serious of all is that Angel is down on his luck and flat broke. The situation is critical. So critical, he might even have to get a job..."

Andrea Mantegna And The Italian Renaissance (pageperfect Nook Book),['Joseph Manca'],"Mantegna was born in 1431. He trained in painting at the Padua School where Donatello and Paolo Uccello had previously attended. Even at a young age commissions for Andrea's work flooded in, for example the frescoes of the Ovetari Chapel of Padua.<br>
In a short space of time Mantegna found his niche as a modernist due to his highly original ideas; the use of perspective in his works. His marriage with Nicolosia Bellini, the sister of Giovanni, paved the way for his entree into Venice.<br>
Mantegna reached an artistic maturity with his altarpiece of Pala San Zeno. He remained in Mantua and became the artist for one of the most prestigious courts in Italy - the Court of Gonzague. Despite his links with Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, Mantegna refused to adopt their innovative use of colour or leave behind his own technique of engraving. The Bridal Suite is considered his most accomplished work."

Naive Art (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Naive art first became popular at the end of the 19th century. Until that time, this form of expression, created by untrained artists and characterised by spontaneity and simplicity, enjoyed little recognition from professional artists and art critics. Influenced by primitive arts, naive painting is distinguished by the fluidity of its lines, vivacity, and joyful colours, as well as by its rather clean-cut, simple shapes.<br>
Naive art counts among it artists: Henri Rousseau, Séraphine de Senlis, André Bauchant, and Camille Bombois. This movement has also found adherents abroad, including such prominent artists as Joan Miró, Guido Vedovato, Niko Pirosmani, and Ivan Generalic."

Claude Monet (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Para Monet, el acto de creación siempre fue una dolorosa lucha. Su obsesión por expresar emociones y transmitir el efecto de la luz sobre la naturaleza fue mucho más intensa que la de sus contemporáneos. En sus palabras: ""Las técnicas vienen y van... el arte siempre es el mismo: una transposición de la naturaleza que requiere tanto de la voluntad como de la sensibilidad. Me esfuerzo y forcejeo con el sol... debería pintar con oro y piedras preciosas""."
Paul Cézanne (pageperfect Nook Book),['Nathalia Brodskaya'],"Paul Cézanne, Zeitgenosse der Impressionisten, durch die er am Anfang seines Schaffens beeinflusst wird, hat sich sehr schnell an seinen persönlichen Interessen orientiert, die aus ihm den aVater der modernen Malerei"" machten. Er hat Braque und Picasso wesentlich beeinflusst. Zu Lebzeiten wenig beachtet und von den Kritikern verachtet, setzt sich Cézanne mit einer neuen Sicht der Natur durch, die auf dem Studium der Farben und des Raumes basiert, welche er durch breite, fliesende Striche schafft. Dieses Buch präsentiert eine reiche Auswahl an Bildern des Künstlers, die er in verschiedenen Epochen gemalt hat.

Bonnard And The Nabis (pageperfect Nook Book),['Albert Kostenevitch'],"Pierre Bonnard was the leader of a group of post-impressionist painters who called themselves the Nabis, from the Hebrew word meaning 'prophet'. Bonnard, Vuillard, Roussel and Denis, the most distinguished of the Nabis, revolutionized the spirit of decorative techniques during one of the richest periods in the history of French painting. Influenced by Odilon Redon and Puvis de Chavanne, by popular imagery and Japanese etchings, this post-impressionist group was above all a close circle of friends who shared the same cultural background and interests. An increasing individualism in their art often threatened the group's unity and although tied together by a common philosophy their work clearly diverged. This publication lets us compare and put into perspective the artists within this fascinating group. The works presented in this collection offer a palette of extraordinary poetic expressions: candid in Bonnard, ornamental and mysterious in Vuillard, gently dream-like in Denis, grim and almost bitter in Vallotton, the author shares with us the lives of these artists to the very source of their creative gifts."

Renaissance Art (pageperfect Nook Book),['Victoria Charles'],"The Renaissance began at the end of the 14th century in Italy and had extended across the whole of Europe by the second half of the 16th century.

Geranium (botanical),['Kasia Boddy'],"They are sometimes called storksbills and originated in South Africa. They may be star-shaped or funnel-shaped, and they range in color from white, pink, and orange-red to fuchsia and deep purple. The geranium and its many species, much loved and also much loathed, have developed since the seventeenth century into one of the most popular garden plants. In this book, Kasia Boddy tells the story of geranium’s seemingly inexorable rise, unearthing the role it has played in everything from plant-hunting and commercial cultivation to alternative medicine, the philanthropic imagination, and changing styles in horticultural fashion.&nbsp;Boddy shows how geraniums became the latest fad for wealthy collectors and enterprising nurserymen after they were first collected by Dutch plant-hunters on the sandy flats near present-day Cape Town. She explains that the flower would not be rare for long—scarlet hybrids were soon found on every cottage windowsill and in every park bedding display, and the backlash against the innocent plant followed quickly on the heels of its ubiquity. Today, geraniums can be found throughout the world, grown as annuals in the regions too cold for them to regenerate. In addition to exploring the history of geraniums, Boddy reveals the plant’s other uses, including how they are cultivated and distilled for their scents of citrus, mint, pine, rose, and various spices to use in perfumes. With their edible leaves, they are also used to flavor desserts, cakes, jellies, and teas, and some people believe that certain species provide an effective treatment for a cough.&nbsp;Featuring over one hundred illustrations, <i>Geranium</i> shows how the plant is portrayed in painting, literature, film, and popular culture, and provides an intriguing example of the global industrialization of plant production."

""Black Cats and Evil Eyes"" sets these superstitions in their historical and social context, explaining how fear of the Devil, demons, evil spirits and witchcraft drove people to arm themselves with rituals and talismans to repel dark forces and allow them to live long and healthy lives.

The Story Of Lingerie (pageperfect Nook Book),"['Muriel Barbier', 'Shazia Boucher']","What is the social merit or purpose of all those bras and panties on perfectly sculpted bodies that we see spread across billboards and magazines? Many women indulge in lingerie to please men. Yet, ever since Antiquity, women have always kept lingerie hidden away under outer garments. Thus, lingerie must be more than erotic bait. Authors Muriel Barbier and Shazia Boucher have researched iconography to explore the relationship of lingerie to society, the economy and the corridors of intimacy. They correlate lingerie with emancipation, querying whether it asserts newfound freedoms or simply adjusts to conform to changing social values. The result is a rigorous scientific rationale spiced with a zest of humour. And the tinier lingerie gets, the more scholarly attention it deserves."

"Nuclear Dawn: The Atomic Bomb, From The Manhattan Project To The Cold War",['James Delgado'],"When President Obama and others say they want to end America's dependence on foreign oil, the vision is usually presented in terms of ""a new Manhattan Project."" So what really was the Manhattan Project? According to James Delgado, at the start of the project in 1942, the element plutonium only existed in microscopic quantities. By June 16, 1945, the date of the world's first nuclear bomb test, America had a fully-operational plutonium industry capable of producing hundreds of pounds of the fissionable material. In just three short years, nuclear weapon technology had progressed from infancy to the world stage. <br>
<br>
Delgado, the co-host of the National Geographic Television series ""The Sea Hunters,"" tells the breathtaking story of the original Manhattan Project and its aftermath. While most previous authors have focused on either the scientific or the social history of the events, Delgado's is the first to spotlight the military and political phases of the atom bomb. In crisp prose, he covers the background of the bomb in the labs in Europe, Britain, and America, but the story picks up speed after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war by America.<br>
<br>
While most people recognize Robert Oppenheimer as the father of the bomb, readers of <i>Nuclear Dawn</i> will be surprised to learn that gave birth more in the sense that Henry Ford gave birth to the auto industry. In Delgado's narrative, Oppenheimer's role as master organizer and astute business manager is emphasized. What's more, few before Delgado have understood how deeply involved the US Army was in the project. From the very beginning, the program was run by army officers, financed by secret wartime military funds--to the tune of billions of dollars, staffed by army engineers and scientists, and made possible by army bureaucracy. Delgado also shows that without the army's ordnance expertise at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer's team could not have turned nuclear technology into a workable bomb.<br>
<br>
Several other unique aspects of <i>Nuclear Dawn</i> turn on the military's role in the project. For example, Delgado tells the full story of the army air force's 509th fighter battalion, which was headed by an iconoclastic colonel named Paul Tibbets. Tibbets' battalion consisted of over 1,200 pilots and crew dedicated to a singular task: delivering an atomic bomb to Japan. Delgado tells how as part of their training, the Utah-based crews would fly practice sorties to Cuba and back, over and over again. <br>
<br>
Another little-known aspect of the Manhattan Project drawn out be Delgado is the post-war bickering that quickly arose between the army and navy over who would control the bomb. James Delgado's new book fills a very important gap in our understanding of the enormous changes that the United States military underwent during WWII.

Magical Paths: Labyrinths & Mazes In The 21st Century,['Jeff Saward'],"Wind your way through a maze or a labyrinth: two symbolic journeys, both rooted in myth and mystery. But while labyrinths are flat, circulate pathways designed for the acquisition of inner peace, mazes feature patterns of barriers that challenge, confuse, and deceive the walker. <br>
After looking at the legends and evolution of these two kinds of complex, twisting paths, Jeff Saward considers the innovative ways today's land artists and garden designers have recreated labyrinths and the new ""craze"" for mazes-from maize mazes and mirror mazes to wood and water mazes and simple garden turf mazes. The diverse and stunning examples come from all around the world, and this breathtakingly photographed overview captures their visual excitement and unique inspiration. <br>

Jasper Johns (pageperfect Nook Book),['Catherine Craft'],"Zu einer Zeit, als der abstrakte Expressionismus die amerikanische Malkunst beherrscht und die Betonung auf kühnen Farben, einem fast brutalen malerischen Duktus und zumeist abstrakten Kompositionen liegt, beschreitet Jasper Johns mit seinen amerikanischen Flaggen, Schiesscheiben, Zahlen und Buchstaben ganz eigene Wege. Obwohl - oder weil - er seine Bilder offensichtlich mit groser Sorgfalt und Präzision malt, wirken sie zurückhaltend, kühl und ruhig, ja, distanziert und jedenfalls weit entfernt von den emotionalen Feuerwerken vieler seiner berühmten Zeitgenossen.<br>
aEs begann damit, dass ich ein Bild der amerikanischen Fahne malte. Durch die Verwendung dieses Designs sparte ich mir Arbeit, ich musste nichts Eigenes entwerfen. Also nahm ich mir weitere ähnliche Dinge vor, etwa Schiesscheiben, bestehende Dinge, die wir alle kennen. Dies gab mir den Raum, auf anderen Ebenen zu arbeiten. Zum Beispiel war für mich die Malerei immer eine Fläche; beim Malen in einer einzigen Farbe wurde dies besonders deutlich. Ich gelangte auch zu der Meinung, dass ein Bild von seinem Betrachter keinen speziellen Fokus verlangen sollte, anders als etwa ein Gang zur Kirche. Ein Bild sollte man anschauen wie einen Heizkörper"".<br>
Im Gegensatz zu den Statements der meisten anderen Künstler im New York der 1950er Jahre waren Johns' Bemerkungen stets frei von modischen Begriffen wie Angst und Zweifel. Er schien seine Sujets bewusst und gezielt im Rahmen einer visuellen und intellektuellen Aktivität auszuwählen, losgelöst von persönlichen Gefühlen und idealistischen Vorurteilen oder Erwartungen. Jüngere Künstler empfanden seine Werke nicht so sehr als kalt und gefühllos, sondern eher als ehrlich und klarsichtig, besonders im Vergleich zu den übersteigerten Ausdrucksformen des abstrakten Expressionismus.<br>
Durch seine Darstellung von allgemein bekannten Gegenständen schien Johns die damals vorherrschende abstrakte Malerei von sich zu weisen. Gleichzeitig besitzen seine Motive, die Flaggen, Zahlen, Zielscheiben, jedoch ein entscheidendes Merkmal der klassischen Abstraktion, nämlich eine Flächigkeit, die sie sozusagen mit der Bildebene eins werden lässt.<br>
Die Autorin zeigt, wie es Jasper Johns mit seinem Werk gelingt, die Polarität zwischen Abstraktion und Repräsentation, die über Jahrzehnte die Debatte um die moderne Kunst beherrscht hatte, aufzuheben. Mit einem Mal war es nun möglich, die Beziehung der Kunst zur Welt in einem ganz neuen Licht zu sehen. Sie befasst sich auch mit der Frage, wie es kommt, dass Johns im Alter von nur 27 Jahren mit seiner ersten Ausstellung in der Leo Castelli Galerie mit einem Schlag zu einem der bekanntesten Künstler der zeitgenössischen Kunstszene wurde und diese Stellung bis heute beibehalten hat.<br>"
