9780061989162,Vagina: A New Biography,['Naomi Wolf'],"<p>An astonishing work of cutting-edge science and cultural history that radically reframes how we understand the vagina—and consequently, how we understand women—from one of our most respected cultural critics and thinkers, Naomi Wolf, author of the modern classic <b>The Beauty Myth</b>.</p>
<p>When an unexpected medical crisis sends Naomi Wolf on a deeply personal journey to tease out the intersections between sexuality and creativity, she discovers, much to her own astonishment, an increasing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the vagina is not merely flesh, but an intrinsic component of the female brain—and thus has a fundamental connection to female consciousness itself.</p>
<p>Utterly enthralling and totally fascinating, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> draws on this set of insights about ""the mind-vagina connection"" to reveal new information about what women really need, and considers what a sexual relationship—and a relationship to the self—transformed by these insights could look like.</p>
<p>Exhilarating and groundbreaking, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> combines rigorous science, explained for lay readers, with cultural history and deeply personal considerations of the role of female desire in female identity, creativity, and confidence, from interviewees of all walks of life. Heralded by <b>Publishers Weekly</b> as one of the best science books of the year, it is a provocative and deeply engaging book that elucidates the ties between a woman's experience of her vagina and her sense of self; her impulses, dreams, and courage; and her role in love and in society in completely new and revelatory ways sure to provoke impassioned conversation.</p>
<p>A brilliant and nuanced synthesis of physiology, history, and cultural criticism, <b>Vagina: A New Biography</b> explores the physical, political, and spiritual implications of this startling series of new scientific breakthroughs for women and for society as a whole, from a writer whose conviction and keen intelligence have propelled her works to the tops of bestseller lists, and firmly into the realms of modern classics.</p>"

9780061994982,I'm Your Man: The Life Of Leonard Cohen,['Sylvie Simmons'],"<p>The legend behind such songs as “Suzanne,” “Bird on the Wire” and “Hallelujah” andthe poet and novelist behind such groundbreaking literary works as <em>Beautiful Losers</em> and <em>Book of Mercy</em>, Leonard Cohen is one of the most important and influential artists of our era, a man of powerful emotion and intelligence whose work has explored the definitive issues of human life—sex, religion, power, meaning, love. Cohen is also a man of complexities and seeming contradictions: a devout Jew, who is also a sophisticate and ladies’ man, as well as an ordained Buddhist monk whose name, Jikan—“ordinary silence”—is quite the appellation for a writer and singer whose life has been anything but ordinary.</p>
<p><em>I’m Your Man</em> is the definitive account of that extraordinary life. Acclaimed music journalist Sylvie Simmons crafts a portrait of Cohen as nuanced as the man himself, drawing on a wealth of research that includes Cohen’s personal archives and more than a hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to Cohen—from his lovers, friends, monks, professors, rabbis and fellow musicians to his muses, including Rebecca De Mornay, Marianne Ihlen, Suzanne Elrod and Suzanne Verdal—and most important, with Cohen himself, whose presence infuses these pages.</p>
<p>Starting in Montreal, Cohen’s birthplace, where he first found fame as a poet in the fifties, Simmons follows his trail, via London and the Greek island of Hydra, to New York in the sixties, where he launched his music career. From there she traces the arc of his prodigious achievements to his remarkable retreat in the mid-nineties—when on the cusp of marriage to a beautiful actress and enjoying the success of his best-selling album to date, he entered a monastery on a rocky mountaintop above Los Angeles—and finally to his reemergence for a sold-out world tour almost fifteen years later. Whether navigating Cohen’s journeys through the back streets of Mumbai or the countless hotel rooms where he has stayed along the way, Simmons explores with equal focus every complex, contradictory strand of Cohen’s life—from the halls of academia to the arenas of rock ’n’ roll—and presents a deeply insightful portrait of both the artist and the man whose vision, spirit, depth and talent continue to move people like no one else.</p>"

While filming on the Chinese–North Korean border, they were chased down by North Korean soldiers who violently apprehended them. Laura and Euna were charged with trespassing and ""hostile acts,"" and imprisoned by Kim Jong Il's notoriously secretive Communist state. Kept totally apart, they endured months of interrogations and eventually a trial before North Korea's highest court. They were the first Americans ever to be sentenced to twelve years of hard labor in a prison camp in North Korea.</p>
<p>When news of the arrest reached Laura's sister, journalist Lisa Ling, she immediately began a campaign to get her sister released, one that led her from the State Department to the higher echelons of the media world and eventually to the White House.</p>
<p><b>Somewhere Inside</b> reveals for the first time Laura's gripping account of what really happened on the river, her treatment at the hands of North Korean guards, and the deprivations and rounds of harrowing interrogations she endured. She speaks movingly about the emotional toll inflicted on her by her incarceration, including the measures she took to protect her sources and her fears that she might never see her family again.</p>
<p>Lisa writes about her unrelenting efforts to secure Laura and Euna's release. Offering insights into the vast media campaign spearheaded on the women's behalf, Lisa also takes us deep into the drama involving people at the highest levels of government, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Senator John Kerry, and Governor Bill Richardson—intense discussions that entailed strategically balancing the agendas and good intentions of the various players. She also describes her role in the back-and-forth between North Korea's demands and the dramatic rescue by former President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Though they were thousands of miles apart while Laura was in captivity, the Ling sisters' relationship became a way for the reclusive North Korean government to send messages to the United States government, which helped lead to Laura and Euna's eventual release.</p>
<p>Told in the sisters' alternating voices, <b>Somewhere Inside</b> is a timely, inspiring, and page-turning tale of survival set against the canvas of international politics that goes beyond the headlines to reveal the impact on lives engulfed by forces beyond their control. But it is also a window into the unique bond these two sisters have always shared, a bond that sustained them throughout the most horrifying ordeal of their lives.</p>"

<i>Discovering the Body</i> is a gripping novel filled with psychological suspense, sensitivity, and emotional complexity. With this stunning debut, Mary Howard has crafted an electrifying and hauntingly evocative novel of truth and perception, of the ties we tell others-and the lies we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>Two years ago Linda Garbo left her graphic design job in Minneapolis to open a printmaking studio in a small town in Iowa with the encouragement of Luci Cole, a weaver and an old friend from art school. Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy.</p>
<p>A beautifully crafted tour de force of significant depth, passion, and power, <i>Discovering the Body</i> is a completely beguiling meditation on perception, loss, memory, and redemption whose conclusion proves to be as significantly haunting as it is satisfying.<br>

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives.

<p>During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death.

9780062024435,Some Remarks: Essays And Other Writing,['Neal Stephenson'],"<p>One of the most talented and creative authors working today, Neal Stephenson is renowned for his exceptional novels—works colossal in vision and mind-boggling in complexity. Exploring and blending a diversity of topics, including technology, economics, history, science, pop culture, and philosophy, his books are the products of a keen and adventurous intellect. Not surprisingly, Stephenson is regularly asked to contribute articles, lectures, and essays to numerous outlets, from major newspapers and cutting-edge magazines to college symposia. This remarkable collection brings together previously published short writings, both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a new essay (and an extremely short story) created specifically for this volume.</p>
<p>Stephenson ponders a wealth of subjects, from movies and politics to David Foster Wallace and the Midwestern American College Town; video games to classics-based sci-fi; how geekdom has become cool and how science fiction has become mainstream (whether people admit it or not); the future of publishing and the origins of his novels. Playful and provocative, <b>Some Remarks</b> displays Stephenson's opinions and ideas on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet, our dwindling national attention span, and the cultural importance of books and bookishness</li>
<li>Waco, religion, and the cluelessness of secular society</li>
<li>Metaphysics and the battle between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</li>
<li>The laying of the longest wire on Earth—and why it matters to you</li>
<li>Technology, freedom, commerce, and the Chinese</li>
<li>How <b>Star Wars</b> and <b>300</b> mirror who we are today and what that spells for our future</li>
<li>Modern Jedi knights, a.k.a. scientists and technologists, and why they are admired and feared by both the left and the right</li>
</ul>
<p>By turns amusing and profound, critical and celebratory, yet always entertaining, <b>Some Remarks</b> offers a fascinating look into the prismatic mind of this extraordinary writer.</p>"

This progressive Red Army is an organized network consisting of numerous specialized groups that target specific policy areas while cooperating more broadly in a concerted decades-long campaign to transform America.</p><p>Now, for the first time, investigative reporters Aaron Klein and Brenda J. Elliott not only expose the key players, organizations, and relationships in this radical network but chart their spheres of influence, their nefarious objectives, their role in shaping Barack Obamaâs agenda, and their long-term plans for the nation.</p><p>Among some of their finds, Klein and Elliott reveal the existence of a powerful 'Marxist-socialist' bloc in Congress (explicitly formed as an arm of the Democratic Socialists of America) and examine its far-reaching goals in policy areas that affect all Americans, including the complete socialization of health care and comprehensive immigration reform, which seeks to change the very nature of the American electorate. The authors expose the shocking misinformation campaign behind Obamaâs economic policies, discussing the crafting of the massive 'stimulus' legislation, as well as his plans for future economic 'reform.'</p><p>In two chapters that every American must read, entirely new information is laid bare on the leftâs unprecedented assault on our already over-liberalized education system. And in just one astonishing discovery, Klein and Elliott bring to light how federal stimulus money was used to fund an education group tied to radical educator (and unrepentant Pentagon bomber) Bill Ayers.</p><p>The authors also expose the multipronged policy offensive aimed at disarming America by emboldening our enemies within and without, spurning traditional allies, subjecting us to the authority of foreign tribunals, and systematically dismantling the U.S. military. The authors also detail how elements of the news media not only collude with these radical groups, but are in some cases members of the very same extremist organizations they ought to be investigating.</p><p>This radical network runs far deeper than the Obama administration and, if not stopped, will far outlast his presidency. From health care and manufacturing to immigration and environmental policy, <b>Red Army</b> documents how these radical groups are working to spread Americaâs wealth and transform the country into their vision of a socialist utopia.</p>"

Kesler's spirited analysis of Obama's political thought shows that he represents either a new birth of liberalism-or its demise.</p><p>Who is Barack Obama? Though many of his own supporters wonder if he really believes in anything, Charles R. Kesler argues that these disappointed liberals don't appreciate the scope of the president's ambition or the long-term stakes for which he is playing.</p><p>Conservatives also misunderstand Obama, according to this leading conservative scholar, educator, and journalist. They dismiss him as a socialist, hopelessly out of touch with the American mainstream. The fringe Right dwells on Obama's foreign upbringing, his missing birth certificate, Bill Ayers's supposed authorship of his books. What mainstream and fringe have in common is a stubborn underestimation of the man and the political movement he embodies.</p><p>Reflecting a sophisticated mix of philosophy, psychology, and history, and complemented by a scathing wit, <b>I Am the Change</b> tries to understand Obama as he understands himself, based largely on his own writings, speeches, and interviews. Kesler, the rare conservative who takes Obama seriously as a political thinker, views him as a gifted and highly intelligent progressive who is attempting to become the greatest president in the history of modern liberalism. Intent on reinvigorating the liberal faith, Obama nonetheless fails to understand its fatal contradictions-a shortsightedness that may prove to be liberalism's undoing.</p><p>Will Obama save liberalism and become its fourth great incarnation, following Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson? Or will he be derailed by his very successes? These are the questions at the heart of Kesler's thoughtful and illuminating book.</p>"

<p>To Frank Cascio, Michael Jackson was many things—second father, big brother, boss, mentor, and teacher, but most of all he was a friend. Though Cascio was just a few years old when he first met Jackson in 1984, at the peak of the pop star’s career, Jackson was at the center of his life for the next twenty-five years, allowing Cascio to observe firsthand the greatest entertainer the world had ever seen. In that time, he became the ultimate Michael Jackson insider, yet remained publicly silent about his experiences. Until now.</p>
<p>In <b>My Friend Michael</b>, Cascio refutes the rumors, lies, and accusations that have accumulated over the years, providing a candid look at the Michael Jackson he knew for more than two decades. Offering an uplifting and definitive account of the legend, Cascio details how he grew up alongside Jackson, traveling the world with him on concert tours and eventually working for him. Through this lens, Cascio captures Jackson’s most private and tumultuous moments, while also setting the record straight on the entertainer’s notorious and misunderstood lifestyle—from his Peter Pan reality and his sexuality to the false allegations against him.</p>
<p>As Cascio shows, there was a great deal more to Michael Jackson than the headlines about him have suggested. Cascio reveals his friend in all his complexity, bringing to light his passions and joys as well as his flaws and eccentricities. Including stories about Jackson that have never before been made public, Cascio creates a balanced, human look at the pop star, one that shows Jackson as the very real person he was—a lively friend with an endearingly juvenile sense of humor.</p>
<p>What emerges is a clear-eyed yet deeply respectful portrait of Jackson—a man who was at times unremarkably average but also terribly scarred by his life in the spotlight. Packed with never-before-seen photos, anecdotes, and insights, <b>My Friend Michael</b> is a trove of Michael Jackson lore that both celebrates his life and redefines our understanding of the man behind the myth.</p>"

<p>Rukhsana knows that this is a shameful, and deeply surreal, idea. The Taliban will never embrace a game rooted in civility, fairness, and equality, with no tolerance for violence or cheating. And no one in Afghanistan even knows how to play the game.</p>
<p>Except for Rukhsana.</p>
<p>This could be a way to get her cousins and her brother out of Afghanistan for good. But before she can organize a team, the terrifying Wahidi demands her hand in marriage. He finds her both exciting and infuriating, and wants to control her unruly, willful nature. The union would be her prison, stripping away what few freedoms she has left under Taliban rule and forcing her away from her family. Not marrying Wahidi, however, might mean her death. Her family rallies around her, willing to do anything to protect her, even if it means imprisonment or worse.</p>
<p>But Rukhsana realizes that Wahidi may have given her a way out, too. With the help of her loyal, beloved brother and cousins, she forms her own cricket team and sets about teaching them how to win their freedom—with a bat and a ball.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Taliban's actual and unprecedented promotion of cricket in 2000 in an attempt to gain acceptance in the global community, internationally bestselling author Murari weaves a riveting story of strength, hope, and soaring human triumph that proves no tyranny is ever absolute in the face of love.</p>"

In discovering and claiming just what that means to him, he plants his focus firmly in the biblical book of Genesis. Here he finds the first articulation of those mythic paradigms that will form in time the legacy of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Here are ""the fathers' wells,"" the deep and difficult source texts for our imagination of God. Pitzele's approach to Genesis is personal and pluralistic. He reads not only with a detailed knowledge of the tales, but with the imagination of a psychodramatist. Scripture for him is full of dramatic possibility and psychological truth. The great cast of archetypal figures - Adam, Eve, Cain, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph - are given a fuller dimension in his rendering of their stories. Woven throughout are slices of Pitzele's own personal history, demonstrating the relationship between myth and experience, between the profound images of the Western spiritual tradition and the life of a man who wrestles with his roles as father, husband, son, and brother. In the spirit of conservation, Pitzele seeks to clarify the wells of our spiritual inheritance. His journey of exploration and self-discovery has an immediacy for any of us grappling to find meaning and relevance in the gifts of the past. His purpose is not merely to retell but to re-animate our foundational stories and to bring them to bear on our own lives."

Widely acclaimed for its perception and scholarship, the book concentrates on a number of leading artists, including Washington Allston, Thomas Cole, Asher B. Durand, Fitz Hugh Lane, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, and Albert Pinkham Ryder. Examining each artist in an individual essay, Barbara Novak presents key ideas on the nature of American art of the nineteenth century, framing these ideas with reference to the eighteenth and twentieth centuries and relating American art to American and European traditions. She draws provocative and original conclusions about the roles in American art of spiritualism and mathematics, analyzes not only the painting but nineteenth-century aesthetic theory as well, achieving a unique synthesis of art and literature. Brief biographies of forty-eight artists mentioned in the text are appended and furnish a valuable reference source.</p>

9780064400558,Charlotte's Web (trophy Newbery),['E. B. White'],"<p>Sixty years ago, on October 15, 1952, E.B. White's <i>Charlotte's Web</i> was published. It's gone on to become one of the most beloved children's books of all time. To celebrate this milestone, the renowned Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo has written a heartfelt and poignant tribute to the book that is itself a beautiful translation of White's own view of the world—of the joy he took in the change of seasons, in farm life, in the miracles of life and death, and, in short, the glory of everything.</p>
<p>We are proud to include Kate DiCamillo's foreword in the 60th anniversary editions of this cherished classic.</p>
<p><i>Charlotte's Web</i> is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilbur—and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn.</p>
<p>With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and by a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to quite a pig.</p>
<p>How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language.</p>
<p>The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.</p>


                        <p>Wilbur the pig is desolate when he discovers that he is destined to be the farmer's Christmas dinner until his spider friend, Charlotte decides to help him.

<p>As best-selling author Kenneth C. Davis knows, history can be fun, fascinating, and memorable. When his don't know much about® history was published in 1990, it was a sensation. The book delivered a fresh take on history with its wit and unusual detail. Davis now does for young people what his earlier book did for adults. In his trademark question-and-answer style — peppered with surprising facts, historic reproductions, and Matt Faulkner's lively illustrations — Davis introduces our ancestors who settled the East and expanded the West, as well as those who had been living here all along. His sure touch brings the drama and excitement of the American story vividly to life.</p>


                        <p>Presents, in question and answer format, a history of the United States from the exploration of Christopher Columbus to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

It is the story of Griffin Tyler, whose androgynous beauty hides the dark pain he holds inside. And finally it is the story of Mab, a pinkie-sized, magenta-haired, straight-talking fairy, who may or may not be real but who helps Barbie and Griffin uncover the strength beneath the pain, and who teaches that love—like a sparkling web of light spinning around our bodies and our souls—is what can heal even the deepest scars.</p>"

9780064431231,Harper Collins Publishers Annos Counting Book (set Of 12),['Mitsumasa Anno'],"Every child is a natural mathematician, according to Mitsumasa Anno. Children start to count long before they learn their ABC's, for they are constantly comparing and classifying things and events they observe around them. As they try to bring sense and order into what they observe, they are actually performing basic mathematical feats.
<p>In this book, Mitsumasa Anno, the creator of the brilliantly inventive Anno's Alphabet, invites young readers on another stimulating adventure of the imagination-this time into the world of numbers and counting. Gentle watercolor pictures show a landscape changing through the various times of day and the turning seasons, months and years, and the activities of the people and animals who come to live there. But the seemingly simple plan of the book is deceptive: look more carefully and you will see one-to-one correspondences; groups and sets; scales and tabulations; changes over time periods; and many other mathematical relationships as they occur in natural, everyday living. Just as our forebears developed our number system from observing the order of nature, the reader is subtly led to see and understand the real meaning of numbers.</p>
<p>Look at this book and look again. Each time you do so, you will find another application of a natural mathematical concept that you had not noticed before.</p>

<i>Scotland, 1818</i>
<p>""Why don't you just pick one, then?""</p>
<p>Standing waist deep in the chilly waters of Loch Glenshea, Ewan MacLaughlin slicked his wet hair back from his face and stared dumbly at his cousin Jamie. ""Pick one what?""</p>
<p>With a sigh and an expression of exasperation, Jamie jerked his head in the direction of the shore. ""One of them.""</p>
<p>A crowd of girls from the village had gathered to watch the boys swim. Some of the girls were trying to goad the others into joining them, for the day was sunny and hot and they'd all been working since sunrise. None of the girls was actually brazen enough to wade in, however.</p>
<p>Ewan scoffed as the sound of giggling drifted across the water. ""What would I want to pick one of them for?""</p>
<p>Jamie scowled, drawing his dark auburn eyebrows together. ""Are ye daft as well as stubborn? So the rest of us might actually have a chance of choosing one as well!""</p>
<p>Ewan truly had no idea what his cousin was talking about, and he was certain he was neither stupid nor stubborn, but as he studied the girls on the shore he noticed that most of them were watching him. An uncomfortable realization settled in his chest. He'd never thought of himself as much of a catch before, but as an eligible, landowning young man of twenty-four, he realized that he was definitely seen as a catch.</p>
<p>I don't want one!"" he blurted with absolute certainty, his heart pounding in his chest. The idea of spending the rest of his life with one of those girls — any girl-filled him with dread.</p>
<p>Wanting to put a stop to this ridiculous conversation, he dove under the surface of the loch, each powerful stroke ofhis arms taking him farther away from his cousin and his absurd questions.</p>
<p>Him, a husband? The very thought filled him with horror. While many of the girls of his village were bonny to be sure, there was not one who caught his interest more than the others. Not one that set his heart pounding or made his palms damp. He couldn't imagine spending the rest of his life with a single one of them. What would they have in common? And what would they think of a husband who sometimes stayed up half the night reading or painting? A sensible Scottish lass would think him as daft as Jamie seemed to think him.</p>
<p>Lungs close to bursting, Ewan broke the surface of the lake, only to find Jamie coming up behind him, his long chestnut hair trailing like seaweed behind him. His cousin's fair skin had finally started to tan rather than burn, but he was still several shades lighter than Ewan. Jamie's complexion was the only delicate thing about him. He was pure Scot through and through-as strong as an ox and just as stubborn as one too. He had to be. It was the only way his family had survived The Clearances. They'd been kicked off their land by the wealthy landowners, and Jamie came to his cousin Ewan looking for work to support his family-and work he did. It was Ewan, the lord of the land, who wasn't a true Scot. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't change the fact that English blood also ran in his veins.</p>
<p>""What do you mean you don't want one?"" Jamie demanded, treading water beside him. ""You'll not find a more bonny lot anywhere-not even in the court of King George himself."" The statement wasn't meant to be insulting, of that Ewan was certain, but it stung all the same.</p>
<p>Ewan averted his gaze so his cousin couldn't see the guilt there. He was certain it was his father's blood — <i>English</i> blood-that made him want to taste the world beyond his tiny village of Lodi Glenshea, beyond Hadrian!s wall to the southern lands of England. He had no good reason to feel such a pull toward his father's homeland. In fact, he resisted it violently. His father had deserted Ewan and his mother years ago, leaving his mother to waste away and eventually die broken and in much lowered circumstances. Ewan had been very young, but memories of his mother were burned into his mind.</p>
<p>Ewan's one memory of him was of his father leaving after his mother's funeral. It was fuzzy, for he'd been just a wee lad of three. At the time, Ewan was glad to stay in Scotland with people he knew, but as he grew older he wondered why his father hadn't taken him with him, why he had left his son to struggle to keep his home standing and his people prosperous. He also wondered why he still thought about his father after all these years. He deserved none of Ewan's curiosity. He certainly didn't deserve the small bit of his son's heart that still ached at the thought of his father not wanting him.</p>
<p>""I have no desire to take a wife, Jamie:' he replied softly. He'd seen what marriage had done to his mother. He had no desire to afflict anyone with that kind of suffering — nor have it put upon him for that matter.</p>
<p>But even as the bitter thoughts ran through his head, they were chased by memories of the kind of marriage his grandparents shared — one of hard work, love, and laughter. He knew that his mother and father's marriage hasn't been a normal one.</p>
<p>Jamie snorted. ""You don't have to marry her, Ewan. Just pay more attention to her than the others so they'll give up hoin' you'll pick one of them and start lookin' at the rest of us...</p>

9780064473422,Belle And The Beau,['Beverly E. Jenkins'],"<h3 align=""center"">Chapter One</h3>
<p><i>April 1859</i></p>
<p><i>Whittaker, Michigan</i></p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Belle Palmer's feet burned like they were on fire. She knew the pain came from all the walking she'd been doing in the too-large boots, and that the soles of her feet were probably raw and covered with blisters, but she couldn't stop and rest. It had now been five days since slave catchers descended on their small party of Kentucky runaways, and Belle and her pa had been separated in the bedlam that followed as everyone ran for their lives. Five days of sleeping on the ground; five days of eating whatever she could find in the fields; and five days of being lost and alone. She'd come North looking for freedom and found only the freedom to starve. With no idea where she was or how to find someone she could trust, she had no choice but to keep moving. The White man who'd guided them into Michigan told them all what to look for should a disaster occur. Folks friendly to escaped slaves hung colored quilts out on their clotheslines; other houses had little Black-faced jockeys out front, and if the lantern in the jockey's hand was lit, it meant fugitives were welcomed. Belle had passed many farmhouses but had seen no such signs.</p>
<p>She'd also committed to memory the secret phrases Underground Railroad conductors sometimes asked to determine if a runaway was indeed who they claimed to be. She remembered all the corresponding answers but couldn't find anyone to ask her the questions.</p>
<p>The early April weather had turned colder last night. She pulled her threadbare coat tighter and forced back the tears filling her eyes from the agony in her feet. Her ugly, homespun trousers were nomatch for the Michigan chill and she shivered in the gray dawn air. She thought about home and what she'd be doing if she dadn't come Nor&amp; She'd be just getting up from her pallet on the floor in her mistress' room and seeing to breakfast. Belle tried not to think about food because her stomach ached with emptiness.</p>
<p>The sudden sound of wagon wheels made Belle quickly seek cover in the thick undergrowth beside the narrow dirt road. Hidden by die weeds she prayed whoever it was would drive on by. Her heart was beating so loud she just knew the sound of it could be heard back home.</p>
<p>""Hey, you boy. Come on out.""</p>
<p>The male voice froze her. She'd been seen. What should she do? Maybe if she didn't show herself the man on the wagon would think he'd only imagined seeing someone and move on.</p>
<p>""We know you're in there,"" called another voice — female this time. ""We won't hurt you:'</p>
<p>To Belle's ears, the girl sounded young.</p>
<p>""I'll bet you're hungry,"" the male voice added. ""We can get you something to eat.'</p>
<p>Belle found that offer so tempting she almost stood right then and there, but held off Suppose they were slave catchers, she asked herself Although she didn't remember hearing of any catchers that rode with young women, this was the North and maybe such things occurred here.</p>
<p>""It's going to get colder and colder today,"" the man pointed out. ""Wouldn't you rather be someplace warm?""</p>
<p>Belle wanted that too. Her nights of sleeping on the ground bad taken their toll. Her clothes were filthy, her body as well. She was tired, sore and sick to death of being lost alone in this strange land. For a few moments more she pondered his offers, then decided she didn't care if they were catchers or not, she just wanted to stop running.</p>
<p>Bolstered by the last of her courage, Belle stood to meet her fate. To her surprise, the young man and girl had brown skin just like hers. They were Colored, she saw with astonished eyes, and were more finely dressed than anyone she knew back home. The man had on a well-tailored brown suit, his female companion a simple gray cloak and matching bonnet that fit her as if it had never belonged to someone else.</p>
<p>He was walking in the brush toward her and even as Belle took a wary few steps backward, she realized hecouldn't be but a few years older than she. He was hand-some too. The dark brown skin and matching eyes were setin a face that had very pleasant features. ""I won't hurtyou, "" he assured her in a gentle voice. ""What's your name?""</p>
<p>""Belle""</p>
<p>His brown eyes assessed her dirty face beneath her battered hat, and then her filthy, ill-fitting clothes. ""That's a funny name for a boy.""</p>
<p>She almost took offense, but being tall and thin, and dressed Re a boy, she said instead, ""Yes it is, but I'm a girl.""</p>
<p>He had the decency to look chagrined. ""Sorry, miss:' He then asked, ""Are you seeking deliverance?""</p>
<p>Belle paused. It was one of the secret questions. Even though Belle knew how to respond she hesitated because the guide also warned them to be extremely cautious when approached by strangers; some folks, both Black and White preyed upon runaways for monetary gain.</p>
<p>But with nothing left to lose, Belle replied, ""Yes. Is deliverance near.</p>
<p>He assessed her for a long moment more before offering, ""Yes, it is:'</p>
<p>Belle wanted to drop to her knees and weep with joyful relief She knew he could see the sheen of tears in her eyes, but he left her dignity by not calling attention to them.</p>
<p>""My name is Daniel Best and that's my sister Josephine back there on the wagon.""</p>
<p>Belle looked out at the girl who seemed to be carefully scanning the road ahead and behind, then heard her call out, ""Come on, Dam. Bring him along before we're seen.""</p>
<p>""He's a <i>she,</i> Jo,"" her brother called back...</p>

""Determined to escape the crushing poverty of his childhood village, Veerappan was lured to a life of crime in his adolescence and eventually amassed a gang with as many as 150 members. He has kidnapped wealthy men, poached precious resources, and viciously ambushed police, killing more than a hundred. He stole such great quantities of explosives from nearby granite operations that the government ordered the industry to shut down. Yet to this day he has eluded capture, despite the government's creation of a special task force, the sole purpose of which is to stop him."" ""The impenetrable Indian jungle provides him with shelter and refuge, while villagers, whether from fear or admiration, protect him from the police, so that year after year he has grown bolder and more power hungry. His most audacious act to date - the kidnapping of India's biggest film star - caused nationwide public upheaval and brought the film industry to a halt, while his demands for ransom presented the government with a crippling legal dilemma."" Investigative journalist Sunaad Raghuram's researched report follows Veerappan's violent progression from a small-time poacher to the bloodthirsty criminal who has flouted the entire Indian police force and government for decades. Using the personal testimony of Veerappan's family members and closest associates, Raghuram recounts this outlaw's crimes and examines his personal life as well, including a surprisingly touching first person account of what Veerappan's wife has endured. Veerappan: India's Most Wanted Man details the methods and madness of a man alternately hailed as a messiah and condemned as a murderer."

<p>These are men who served in the army, navy, air force, and Marine Corps. Officers and enlisted men, career servicemen and citizen soldiers. Men of European, African, Asian, Latino, and Native American ancestry. Men who speak with the authentic voices of an Indiana farmer, a Brooklyn bus driver, a Louisiana businessman, a Seattle machinist. The contrasts between World War II and Vietnam are everywhere in these compelling accounts: the clear aims of World War II, the muddled goals of Vietnam; the heroes' welcome accorded World War II veterans, the scorn heaped upon their sons. But the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> are also rich with elements intrinsic to all wars and all soldiers: courage, honor, service, duty, youth, adventure, fear, idealism, love of country and of family, exasperation with military bureaucracy. In these pages you will find war's carnage and war's heroism, war's purpose and war's futility, war's meaning and war's tragic meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Taken together, the stories in <b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> tell the history of two wars, each the defining experience of a generation. This is history told not at the level of presidents and generals, but through the recollections of men who shouldered the rifles, manned the ships, and flew the planes. We're familiar with the effects of the two wars on world politics. But what did they do to American families? Molded by the awful crucible of war, these seemingly ordinary men offer extraordinary insights into what it means to be a warrior, an American, a father, and a son.</p>
<p><b>Brave Men, Gentle Heroes</b> is a book for those who have been to war and those who have been spared its horror. It is a book for individuals to reflect upon and families to share.</p>"

But it was only after Hoshino's tragic death from a bear attack that Schooler succeeded in photographing the animal — and only then that he Was able to complete his journey and find new meaning in his own life.</p>
<p>Set amid the wild archipelagoes, glittering fjords, and dense primordial forests of Alaska's Glacier Coast, <b>The Blue Bear</b> is an unforgettable book that shines with purity and passion.</p>"

How can we be certain? 
<p>Shortly after his father's death, Gianni Orzan reaches the disturbing conclusion that his father did not love him. Aloof and dismissive, Maurizio Orzan seldom had anything to say to his son. Moreover, he was a staunch fascist.</p>
<p>Or so Gianni thought. Then comes the day he's contacted by a complete stranger who has a disquieting familiarity with his life. In what amounts to kidnapping, the stranger pursues an urgent mission: to convince Gianni that the father he knew was an illusion; that Maurizio was, in fact, a double agent for the KGB.</p>
<p>What is Gianni to believe? If this stranger's revelations are true, they threaten to destroy Gianni's steadfast beliefs about his father's shameful, self-created identity and promise to send his life crashing down around him.</p>
<p>Narrated with deft wit and subtle reflection, <i>The Force of the Past</i> — winner of Italy's Viareggio-Repaci Prize and the Premio Campiello and a finalist for the Zerilli-Marimò prize — is an insightful look at how one son tries to comprehend his father's mysterious complexities, as well as a provocative, ironic examination of how men construct their own subjective versions of reality.</p>

Huddling in chains, with other frightened captives, the seven-year-old claimed to be a prince of Abyssinia, a ""noble Moor"" kidnapped and stolen out of Africa. His tragedy was shared by millions of black people caught up in the Islamic slave trade, but his destiny was unique: rescued by Peter the Great, the young African became Abram Petrovich Gannibal.</p>
<p>Russia's westernizing tsar adopted the child and, in a bizarre nature-and-nurture experiment, lavished on him the best education available in the new ""European"" capital of Saint Petersburg. Gannibal, the ""Negro of Peter the Great,"" soared to dizzying heights as a soldier, diplomat, mathematician and spy. He was fêted in glittering salons, from the Winter Palace to the Louvre, and came to know Voltaire and Montesquieu, who praised him as the ""dark star of Russia's enlightenment."" At the same time, his military exploits, from northern Spain to the icy wastes of Siberia — to say nothing of his marital problems — sealed Gannibal's reputation as the Russian Othello.</p>
<p>African prince or not, the ex-slave founded a dynasty of his own in Russia, where he came to embody the strengths and weaknesses of the country itself — volatile, courageous, handsome, gifted and always astonishing. His descendants included not only Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet, but also, in England, several Mountbattens and others close to the royal family.</p>"
9780066212661,"What Zizi Gave Honeyboy: A True Story About Love, Wisdom, And The Soul Of America",['Gerald Celente'],"<p>One recent spring Gerald Celente went to visit his cuddly eighty-three-year-old Italian aunt, Zizi, in Yonkers, New York. He was expecting the same delectable combination of food, friendship, and motherly love that Zizi had served up through the years at her little kitchen table. But Celente got more than he expected. Over chicken cutlets and games of Scrabble, the straight-talking Zizi raised some tough questions for her nephew, ""Honeyboy,"" to consider. Targeting some of the essential issues of our time-work, family, health care, politics, war, and aging in America — Zizi made Celente think about whether America was delivering on its promises. Have we lost too many timeless old-world values in the march of progress? Are we really better off today than we were yesterday? And what does the future hold for each one of us, our families, and our community as a whole?</p>
<p>Celente thought he had it all figured out. As the founder of the Trends Research Institute, he is well respected for his track record of picking business, consumer, political, and economic trends before they come to pass. It is his job to see the future and understand how the issues and events of today will determine the trends of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But it took Zizi to help him see the unsettling truths about what has happened to America over the last several decades. They would talk about the world they once knew — a world filled with family, dinners together, and Sundays at church. Zizi would remember ""back then"" with fondness, and Celente would recall his years growing up with his parents and six siblings. As they reflect on their pasts, their lives, and where we've arrived as a nation, Celente and Zizi realize that something has been lost. There is an emptiness that most of us feel. But what is the cause of it? And what can we do to fix it?</p>
<p>In <b>What Zizi Gave Honeyboy,</b> Gerald Celente provides a provocative look at our lives today and a glimpse of the future we deserve in Zizi's warmth, her recipes, and her wisdom.</p>"

Bush In The White House",['David A Kaplan'],"<p>For thirty-seven days after the disputed presidential election of 2000, we watched great theater, as George W Bush and Al Gore slugged it out in the swamp. You may think you've read it all before, but now <b>Newsweek's</b> David A. Kaplan goes behind the scenes of the sanctimony and machinations. In his critically acclaimed bestseller, <b>The Silicon Boys</b>, Kaplan took us inside Silicon Valley. In <b>The Accidental President</b>, he does the same for this epic moment in American history — a harmonic convergence of politics and law, media and culture.</p>
<p>With his mordant wit and incisive storytelling, Kaplan tells us how — contrary to popular belief — the Supreme Court's ruling for Bush was <b>not</b> a foregone conclusion and why the dissenting justices thought, until the last second, they could lure the one equivocating colleague they'd derisively nicknamed ""Flipper."" We're in the room when Gore decides that, more than any great lawyer, the one person he needs in Recountland is . . . Erin Brockovich. We learn which Bush partisan covertly marionetted the strings behind Katherine Harris. And we're treated to sketches of the characters they called Secret Squirrel and the Fine-Looking Man and of the political operative who jumped from a moving train.</p>
<p>Through it all — butterflies and boils; concessions, recantations, and fraternal recriminations; lawyers, more lawyers, and 181 invocations of the phrase ""uncharted waters"" — Kaplan paints a picture of an extraordinary episode for the country. There are few heroes in this tale. No person or institution comes out looking very good. ""Rule of law"" simply meant trying to figure out a way <b>around</b> the law — realpolitik by any other name.</p>
<p>The outcome of Bush versus Gore was a colossal fortuity, an election gone bad, made worse by an inconceivable coincidence of accidents. A lucky tactical call here, a confusing ballot there — amid all the folly and hypocrisy, these are what landed Bush in the White House. Different turns might have cast destiny the other way. Bush is our nation's first accidental president, just as Gore would have been. Bush may thrive or stumble in office. But either way, few will forget how he got there after November 7, 2000.</p>
<p>This is the definitive story of those thirty-seven days and why they matter.</p>"

Veteran journalist Burt Solomon uses these families to explore everything from the customs of Washington's grand hostesses to the surge in the federal bureaucracy to the critical roles that politicking and lobbying have played as the capital has grown more truly democratic.</p><ul><li>The Boggs family came to Washington during the age of political giants. Hale Boggs, a prominent congressman from Louisiana, was the protÃ©gÃ© of Sam Rayburn and close friends with John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. When Boggs died in a plane crash, he was succeeded by his widow, Lindy, a political power in her own right. Their son, Tommy Boggs, is one of the capital's most influential lobbyists, and their daughter, Cokie Roberts, is a distinguished member of the Washington press corps.</li><li>Real-estate developer Morris Cafritz changed the physical face of the city, giving form to Washington's new downtown, centered along K Street, which would become the center of activity for lobbyists and power brokers. His wife, Gwen, a legendary socialite, hosted the city's most exclusive parties, bringing together eminent politicians, jurists, and diplomats into a self-conscious elite.</li><li>Julius Hobson Sr. was a leading black activist in the first black-majority city in America. A brilliant and imaginative militant during the civil rights era, he served on D.C.'s first elected city council and fought for the capital's autonomy from the federal government before his death in 1977. His son, Julius Hobson Jr., became a political figure of a contrasting sort, an insider instead of an agitator, who worked for Mayor Marion Barry and went on to become the top lobbyist at the American Medical Association.</li></ul><p>Each family's story forms a strand of the city's single history. Their lives were entwined with those of other Washington notables - from Eleanor Roosevelt to Lady Bird Johnson, Perle Mesta, Stokely Carmichael, J. Edgar Hoover, Tip O'Neill, Jesse Jackson, John F. Kennedy, and even a twenty-six-year-old Bill Clinton.</p><p><b>The Washington Century</b> is also the behind-the-scenes biography of an intricate and ever-changing city, once a gracious capital that has become a money-driven and partisan place. Solomon's ingenious narrative, written with the pace and sense of a novel, is full of quirky moments and unforgettable characters, both familiar and unfamiliar to the American public, who made a sleepy, southern town into the soul of a nation. Compulsively readable, as enlightening as it is entertaining, here is a fascinating chapter of living history.</p>"

<p>""Inversions"" are words that read the same upside down or in a mirror. Or words cleverly hidden inside other words. Each has something to fool the eye, a special visual trick; at the same time the words Kim has chosen to illustrate in this imaginative catalog of challenging visual wordplay reflect the idea of symmetry, both in art and in science.</p>
<p>Sixty pages of images portray short and long words, words describing symmetries, variations on Gödel, Escher, Bach and on calligraphic themes, and contemporary, historical, and personal names. They are followed by an illustrated text that explores the skills that go into making inversions: symmetry, vision, and letterforms; processes and examples; and associations with music, wordplay, and art. The book is designed so that the text is also symmetrical - what is said in the lefthand column of a page frequently matches the meaning of what is said in the righthand column.</p>

Now, their neighborhood is a Chesapeake Bay cove, or a secluded Bahamian beach, or anywhere else they choose to anchor. And along the way they raised two daughters. All in the Same Boat is one family's testament to the belief that you can lead your own life, whatever that might be. For the Neales, it hasn't been a vacation. Instead of mowing the lawn, they fix the watermaker or make bread from scratch; instead of trying to find good schools for the kids, they make their own good school; instead of living to work, they work to live, making time for adventure and play. Here is how they do it, and how you can do it too, with hard-won tips, practical suggestions, and life lessons on everything from developing a cruising frame of mind to choosing and customizing the right boat to dealing calmly with the myriad problems, big and small, that will ship with you on your journey."

In these pages we glimpse a society as vivid as the aquamarine waters of the reefs and the patched sails of graceful boats.</p><p>As he explored the family traditions of the Antillean seafarers, Pyle found himself admiring one boatbuilder in particular, Haakon Mitchell of Bequia. Mitchell had been a fisherman until an accident cost him a hand; when Pyle met him, he and his sons were building a vessel for inter-island trade. Starting first as an observer, then as a helper, Pyle finally became one of the family, working on the new sloop each day and taking meals with Mitchell and his sons. Their lifelong friendship is a central theme of <i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i>.</p><p>But this is more than a lyrical evocation of a place and time. In his years among the islands Pyle collected information on all the different boat types sailing at the time. The second half of the book is a journey from Trinidad to the Virgin Islands, with a look at each type.</p><p><i>Clean, Sweet Wind</i> captures Antillean speech, beliefs, and hospitality with as faithful an accuracy as it renders the graceful designs of Caribbean boats. The result is both a detailed study of traditional watercraft and one of the finest regional narratives yet written.</p>"

Here is the first comprehensive boater's guide to the almost 2,000 miles of shoreline and more than 300 islands that lie between Washington's capital of Olympia and the Canadian border at Point Roberts, including the San Juans.</p>
<p>Veteran Pacific Northwest cruiser and award-winning author Migael Scherer brings more than 20 years of Puget Sound sailing to this guide, offering intricate, hard-earned local knowledge of the approaches, anchorages, and facilities of hundreds of bays, harbors, and inlets, with annotated charts for many. Here also are insights into local history and attractions, and a rating system that details every harbor and anchorage, how and where to get ashore, and what facilities to expect.</p>
<p><i>A Cruising Guide to Puget Sound</i> shows you not only where to cruise but how to make your cruise safer and more enjoyable, with a detailed discussion of weather, tides, currents, and the effects of commercial shipping, logging, and fishing.</p>
<p>Migael Scherer is a graceful, meticulous, and observant writer whose love and appreciation of all that Puget Sound offers rings clearly. Here is her personal tour.</p>
<p>From Olympia through the San Juans to Point Roberts on the Canadian border and Port Angeles in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Puget Sound offers nearly 300 islands and some 2,000 miles of shoreline.</p>
<p>Here is the definitive guide, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Tested piloting information, with comprehensive details on approaches, anchorages and moorage, getting ashore, and things to do</li>
<li>Harbor and anchorage ratings, including beauty and interest, protection, and facilities-at-a-glance</li>
<li>Advice on coping with tides and currents, weather, commercial traffic, log booms, and other navigational challenges</li>
<li>Annotated chartlets</li>
<li>Local history and seasonal highlights</li>
</ul>
<p>""Everything a yachtsman's pilot ought to be: shipshape and workmanlike in its approach, unusually well written, very thoughtfully researched. . . . I wish you'd put the price up to, say, $1,000, and thereby deter a few people from discovering the anchorages that until now have been quietly traded between friends.""—Jonathan Raban</p>

Donnall Thomas'],"In his Preface to Whitefish Can't Jump, Don Thomas writes: ""A space alien arriving on the Big Hole during the middle of the salmon-fly hatch might conclude that the same sport an earlier writer had trouble distinguishing from religion is really about entomology, fashionable outdoor wear, and power, all of which is wrong. Above all else, fly-fishing is about fish and the places they are found."" Here, then, are nineteen fly-fishing stories refreshingly devoid of Latin, pink shirts, and angling glitterati - stories where the fish and the places they are found unabashedly occupy center stage. On the flats of Christmas Island, the fusion of Fin-Nor and bonefish becomes only the second lifetime experience to live up to its advance billing. On a river in southwestern Alaska, boating a huge rainbow where no huge rainbow should be becomes more important than avoiding a midstream collision with a nine-foot grizzly. A Montreal gas-station attendant's tip leads to a far-northern pond and a harrowing encounter with The Ultimate Northern Pike. The quixotic quest for a permit on a fly in Belize is marred only slightly by a dissolving marriage and a Blue Crab Special impaled in a philosophical guide's ear. In Siberia, Dolly Varden, vodka, and the novelty of Catch-and-Release combine to thaw the cold war. And in the Yellowstone River, a new season begins with Rocky Mountain Whitefish and the reminder of just how arbitrary the distinction between gamefish and just-plain-fish can be. And why it ultimately doesn't matter. From each story we learn a little about fishing, a lot about fish, and a thing or two about life - or at least the kind of life where time spent on the water with fly rod in hand is infinitely more important than time spent anywhere else.

                        <p>In these nineteen lyrical stories, E. Donnall Thomas, Jr., presents an absorbing celebration of the fly-fishing lifestyle. From Alaska, to Christmas Island, to the Ultimate Northern Pike, to Yellowstone and other locales, we discover in these stories a little about fishing and a lot about life.

<p>Any number of construction methods will produce a beautiful boat. But for the backyard builder with limited experience and a tight budget, the choice is not so complicated. Traditional plank-on-frame and cold-molded construction require complicated lofting and building molds—to say nothing of expensive tooling and lots of time. Stitch-and-glue construction, on the other hand, can produce the same results with a substantial savings in time and money. The process is quicker, easier, uses fewer parts, and produces a boat that is much easier to maintain—without the building molds and with only the simplest lofting. For tools, you need little more than a circular saw, a sander/polisher/grinder, a block plane, a framing square, a level, and a tape measure.</p>
<p>Sam Devlin has elevated stitch-and-glue boatbuilding to an artform, and his graceful designs have attracted the attention of backyard builders across the country. Here is all you need to know to build the boat of your dreams, whether it's a 7-foot dinghy or a 40-foot power cruiser. <i>Devlin's Boatbuilding: How to Build Any Boat the Stitch-and-Glue Way</i> shares the wisdom of his 16 years of experience designing, building, and helping others build his fleet of small sail- and powerboats.</p>

Steiner']","Steiner &amp; Steiner,the leading Business &amp; Society text,is about the interrelationships among business,government,and society and how they effect business managers. Managers steer companies through a world continuously altered by environmental forces that reshape the economic,cultural,political,technological and ecological terrain on which companies operate. Numerous stakeholders challenge traditional ideas about when corporations are being ethical and socially responsible. These two forces create a web of complex,challenging and threatening relationships for managers,both domestically and internationally. Four basic analytical approaches are presented as alternative ways of picturing the interrelationships: 1) Market Capitalism; 2) Dominance; 3) Dynamic Forces; 4) Stakeholder. The texts analytical models are as follows : 1) Focus on Strategic Management; 2) Interdisciplinary Approach with a Managerial Focus; 3) Comprehensive Scope; 4) Focus on Theory; 5) Historical Perspective; 6) Global Perspective. 
<p> Steiner and Steiner,one of the first books in this course area,has benefited greatly from the reputation of its authors. George Steiner,the father in this father-and-son team,is one of the pioneers in the field. The text includes coverage of all the distinct content areas and is one of the most complete on the market. The book is well researched and includes the latest thinking on the ethical implications of business in its relation to society. It uses case examples to illustrate the concepts and to show the application of theory to practice.</p>"

The second edition of this Handbook, published in 1990, appeared at the beginning of a decade marked by extensive advances in assessment in essentially all of its specialized areas. There are many new tests, new applications of established tests, and new test systems. Major revisions have appeared of established tests, notably the Wechsler intelligence scales. The time seemed right for a third edition, since even over the relatively brief period of ten years, many tests described in the second edition have been replaced, and are no longer commonly used. Furthermore, much new research in such areas as neuropsychology, cognitive science, and psychopathology have made major impacts on how many tests and other assessment procedures are used and interpreted. This third edition represents an effort to give the reader an overview of the many new developments in assessment, while still maintaining material on basic psychometric concepts in order for it to continue to serve as a comprehensive handbook for the student and professional.<br>

We begin by describing waves, their measurement and characteristics, their behavior in shallow water, and unusual waves. Next, we consider mainly theoretical aspects of sediment movement and deposition by currents, before discussing wave action in the littoral zone, tidal current action on tidal flats and in estuaries, and the interaction of waves, tides and river flow in deltas. Finally, we examine shelf-sea processes, including an outline of their mineral resources."

Most people - even those the contras had swept into power - just wanted to forget them. And now, after trying to make the peace work, they are back in the hills rearming. The story of the contras and their strange relationship with their CIA sponsors is one of courage, political intrigue, and general craziness. Pulitzer nominee Glenn Garvin took notes."

9780080952246,End-to-end Game Development: Creating Independent Serious Games And Simulations From Start To Finish,"['Nick Iuppa', 'Terry Borst', 'Chris Simpson']","You're part of a new venture, an independent gaming company, and you are about to undertake your first development project. The client wants a serious game, one with instructional goals and assessment metrics. Or you may be in a position to green light such a project yourself, believing that it can advance your organization's mission and goals. This book provides a proven process to take an independent game project from start to finish. <br>
<br>
In order to build a successful game, you need to wear many hats. There are graphic artists, software engineers, designers, producers, marketers - all take part in the process at various (coordinated) stages, and the end result is hopefully a successful game. Veteran game producers and writers (Iuppa and Borst) cover all of these areas for you, with step by step instructions and checklists to get the work done.<br>
<br>
The final section of the book offers a series of case studies from REAL indy games that have been developed and launched succesfully, and show exactly how the principles outlined in the book can be applied to real world products. <br>
<br>
The book's associated author web site offers ancillary materials &amp; references as well as serious game demos and presentations."

What permits us to distinguish between living and nonliving things even though both are made of the same minerals? Is the complex structure of organisms proof that a creative force is working its will in the physical universe, or are existing life forms the random result of an evolutionary process working itself out over eons of time? What moral questions arise regarding genetic engineering or cloning? What is more relevant to human nature: genetics or sociocultural influences? Are we unique in the universe or might other forms of life exist out there somewhere? Is Darwinism the death-knell of God?"
9780091159108,The Great Reform Act,['M. G. Brock'],"Environmental services departments are essential for maintaining hospital operations during an emergency situation. With that in mind, ASHES has developed a new recommended practice document that provides multi disciplinary guidance, particularly for environmental services departments on issues and concerns that arise during all phases of a disaster. Beginning with a national overview of government programs currently in place, this document covers the entire spectrum of a disaster; drilling down to aspects encountered by frontline workers. The tool can be used as a facility-wide step-by-step guide for disaster preparedness with an emphasis on cleaning for health, hygiene and safety."

The story begins in Brittany where a young, poor boy somehow passes his medical exams and goes to Paris, where he attends the lectures of Charcot, the Parisian neurologist who set the world on its head in the 1870s. With a friend, he sets up a clinic in the mysterious mountain district of Carinthia in south-east Austria.<br>

If <b>The Girl at the Lion d’Or</b> was a simple three-movement symphony, <b>Birdsong</b> an opera, <b>Charlotte Gray</b> a complex four-movement symphony and <b>On Green Dolphin Street</b> a concerto, then <b>Human Traces</b> is a Wagnerian grand opera."

She and her husband, Peter, had long dreamed of buying an old ruin and escaping the pace and excesses of modern life. But it was only when they had moved into the vandalized, squalidly filthy, cold and wet Gwydir Castle that they began to realize what restoration dramas lay ahead. Restoring the 16th-century castle, which reduced the couple to near penury, turned their lives into a curious blend of real and imaginary, past and present. But the magic of the place, its history and the landscape, ensured that they stayed to tell this charming, deeply romantic tale of escape and homecoming.</p>"

The iconic Albert Einstein emerges as a dashing ladies' man and the greatest scientist of his time; but why did Charles Darwin wait for decades before going public with his ideas on evolution? How was Marie Curie's great work shaped by her childhood experiences of oppression under the Czars? And what was Edmond Halley, of comet fame, doing as Captain of a King's Ship and later spy for the Crown? An introduction and afterword places each scientist's work in the context of the development of their subject."

From the moment when he realizes that the musicians perform in a freezing cellar underneath the royal apartments, Peter Claire understands that he's come to a place where the opposing states of light and dark, good and evil are waging war to the death. Designated the King's 'Angel' because of his good looks, he finds himself falling in love with the young woman who is the companion of the King's adulterous and estranged wife, Kirsten. With his loyalties fatally divided between duty and passion, how can Peter Claire find the path that will realize his hopes and save his soul?</p>"

In this extraordinary book, Ann Wroe recounts the lives of all our Pilates, among them the glittering medieval tyrant devoted to gambling; the early-Christian intellectual; the beleaguered Victorian administrator; the Coptic saint, martyred on the cross; the Alpine devil, in league with Satan to claim the souls of mountain climbers; and the wriggling modern pragmatist, whose dilemma over Jesus has been described by Tony Blair as ""a timeless parable of political life.""<br>
<br>
This is also the story, as far as it can be reconstructed from archaeology and from classical sources, of the real Pilate: his likely background, his career, his duties, his failings, his fears, and the attitude he might have had to the various forms of thinking he encountered in Judea. Ann Wroe shows how, in his struggles with fate and free will, Pilate's story has also become the story of ourselves."

His reputation as a storyteller has grown over the last decade, and his exquisite, subtle texts continue to inspire readers all over the world. Chatwin was different things to different people: a director at Sotheby's, an archaeologist, a journalist, photographer and art collector. Married for 23 years, he was also an active homosexual. He was at once a socialite mixing with the rich and famous, and a loner who explored the limits of extreme solitude. From unrestricted access to Chatwin's private notebooks, diaries and letters, Nicholas Shakespeare has compiled the definitive biography of one of the most charismatic and elusive literary figures of our time."

But his dream is about to be put on hold. Arriving at the stables late one night, Lincoln walks into a crisis. Thieves have viciously attacked the stable owners' daughter, leaving her unconscious. As she lies in a coma, what appears to be freak chance sets Lincoln on the trail of the attackers. Disregarding the advice of the police and the increasingly unpleasant warnings from those involved, he juggles sleuthing with a demanding job and competitive riding career. But, as the violence escalates, it becomes chillingly clear that someone is trying to kill him for reasons of their own—and the race is on to find out who, before they succeed.</p>"

Rescued and raised by a plutocrat, Zeno Generoso, Ludo finds himself entrenched in the gated, guarded community of the super-rich.
<p>Now twenty-seven, Ludo works for a vacuous ""communications company"" that markets unwanted, unaffordable products aimed at the very underclass into which he was born and from which he escaped. To make matters more complicated, he has developed an obsessive, adulterous love for his adoptive sister, whose husband is his only friend.</p>
<p>Ludo's involvement in an ill-conceived supermarket launch aimed at the favela's desperately poor population risks embroiling him in a world of violence and brutality. By turns darkly humorous and poignant, James Scudamore's Booker Prize-nominated novel is a highly original, surprising take on the rags-to-riches story.</p>"

As he observes the behaviour of the human beings he meets in the forest, he begins to gradually understand human civilization and learn their language. Although he can pose as one of them, he is also able to assume the form of animals and cause things to happen simply by willing them. Skord survives for five hundred years and lives many different lives but, despite his learning, he finds it difficult to resist the call of the forest and returns there periodically to rejoin the band of forest outlaws who live outside human society.</p>"

The importance of rapid, accurate examinations of tensions between Philosophy and Law and the relationship between philosophical principles and empirical data has never been greater.<br>
<b>The Concise Encyclopedia of Ethics of New Technologies</b> includes 23 articles previously published in the highly-acclaimed <b>Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics,</b> nine updated articles, and five new articles, commissioned especially for this volume. Over half of the previously published articles include updated facts and bibliographic citations. Authors of genetics articles have updated their works to include the most recent developments and publications. New articles include: ""Cloning,"" ""Geneticization,"" ""Health Technology Assessment,"" ""Intrinsic and Instrumental Value,"" and ""Novel Foods.""</p>
<p>Articles fall into these subject categories:<br>
• Medical Ethics<br>
• Scientific Ethics<br>
• Theories of Ethics<br>
• Environmental Ethics<br>
• Legal Ethics<br>
• Ethical Concepts</p>


                        <p><b>Audience:</b> This volume will appeal to everyone who bought the Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics, and everyone who could use a shorter and more focused version. These include public libraries, special libraries, and law libraries that want to maintain a comprehensive survey of the applied ethics field. Students of philosophy and ethics as well as individuals interested in medical and scientific (or ""bio-"") ethics will also find the volume useful.

In December 1994, Orange County became the largest municipality in U.S. history to become bankrupt. By borrowing heavily and placing the wrong bets, Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron lost $1.7 billion of Orange County's $7.4 billion investment portfolio.<br>
<b>Big Bets Gone Bad: Derivatives and Bankruptcy in Orange County</b> is the first detailed description of the Orange County bankruptcy. Author Philippe Jorion, the only professor in Orange County who teaches and researches derivatives, is uniquely placed to understand the technical details of the portfolio and climate in the Orange County municipal government that encouraged the decisions that led to the bankruptcy.<br>
<b>Big Bets Gone Bad</b> provides an introduction to the U.S. bond market and details Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's efforts to tighten credit. Its description of the $35 trillion derivatives market makes the losses of Barings Bank, Kashima Oil, West Virginia, and Metallgesellschaft more understandable. <b>Big Bets Gone Bad</b> explains what everyone should know about tax monies and public investments. Because nobody likes to lose $1.7 billion.

It is both a text reference and a textbook that reviews and analyses the research output in this field of binary image processing. It is aimed at both advanced researchers as well as educating the novice to this area. The theoretical part of this book includes the basic principles required for binary digital image analysis. The practical part which will take an algorithmic approach addresses problems which find applications beyond binary digital line image processing.<br>
The book first outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the study of digital image processing with particular reference to those needed for line image processing. The theoretical tools in the first part of the book set the stage for the second and third parts, where low-level binary image processing is addressed and then intermediate level processing of binary line images is studied. The book concludes with some practical applications of this work by reviewing some industrial and software applications (engineering drawing storage and primitive extraction, fingerprint compression).
<p>The book:</p>
<p>* outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the study of digital image processing with particular reference to binary line image processing<br>
* addresses low-level binary image processing, reviewing a number of essential characteristics of binary digital images and providing solution procedures and algorithms<br>
* includes detailed reviews of topics in binary digital image processing with up-to-date research references in relation to each of the problems under study<br>
* includes some practical applications of this work by reviewing some common applications<br>
* covers a range of topics, organised by theoretical field rather than being driven by problem definitions<br>

All materials have surfaces. When two or more materials are put together, interfaces appear. In composite materials, interfaces play a crucial role in determining mechanical, optical, and electronic properties.<br>
<br>
Surfaces and interfaces can be dramatically altered when surfactant molecules are applied to them, modifying not only the interactions between two materials at the interface, but also the bulk properties of a composite. Surfactants are key materials in processes involving adhesion, coating, mixing, domain formations, and many other phenomena in the medical, pharmaceutical, chemical, and electronic industries.<br>
<br>
Surfactants exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena such as formations of micelles, vesicles, layers, and gels. They provide a fascinating example of self-assembly. Surfactants have many phases and undergo phase transitions between them. Understanding these phenomena is a great challenge for physics and chemistry, and is of increasing technological importance.<br>
<br>
Dr. Kaoru Tsujii is one of the pioneers and leaders in the science and technology of surfactants. He has long expolored the field, both in theory and in industrial applications, and seeks to demonstrate applications of surfactants in our everyday life and industry. The book will serve as an excellent text and reference for researchers and students who wish to know more about surfactants.

For some people, this topic is a parlour trick, an amazing intellectual exercise that rattles around the foundations of knowledge. For others, the topic has immense practical importance. An enemy can only control your message if they can find it. If you hide data, you can protect your thoughts from censorship and discovery.

                        <p>This book deals with how information can disappear so that no one knows of its existence. Convential cryptography merely scambles information into an impenetrable block. This book describes how data can be hidden in the background noise of pictures, sound recording or even bad poetry.Disappearing Cryptography is a collection of mathematical tricks and computational sleights of hand that explore the very foundations of information.

Quinn Mills', 'Daniel Quinn Mills']","<p>Why did the Internet and Enron stock collapses really happen? Was it arrogance? Greed? The ""madness of crowds""? Just plain bad luck? Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>In <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i>, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills offers the first systematic analysis of both the Internet stock bubble and the Enron scandal. Drawing upon new research-including an extensive review of the latest lawsuits and securities documents-Mills uncovers both systemic causes and outrageous misbehavior. He demonstrates how each link in the ""financial value chain,"" from venture funds to auditors and regulators, not only failed to protect small investors, but also actively contributed to their losses.</p>
<p>Mills demonstrates why it didn't have to be that way, comparing the U.S. experience with that of Germany, which experienced its own Internet stock bubble with far milder consequences to ordinary investors. He then offers practical and detailed recommendations for investors, citizens, and policymakers seeking to keep it from happening again.</p>

<li>Includes the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse</li>
<li>Why the Internet stock collapse was no accident</li>
<li>Who lost—and who benefited</li>
<li>How the disaster could have been averted</li>
<li>Avoiding the next speculative bubble: techniques for investors, recommendations for policymakers</li>
</ul>
<p>Investors lost millions of dollars in the Internet collapse—and, according to conventional wisdom, they only have themselves to blame for being greedy, shortsighted, and ignorant of business fundamentals. But is that the real story? In this riveting and insightful book, Harvard Business School Professor D. Quinn Mills argues that the Internet bubble and subsequent collapse was no accident: Blame can be placed squarely at the feet of venture firms, investment banks, accountants, mutual funds, brokerages, federal regulators, and the Federal Reserve—not ""dumb small investors."" Through extensive original research and the contributions of many active participants, <i>Buy, Lie, and Sell High</i> offers authoritative answers to the questions every investor is asking: ""What actually happened during the Internet bubble?"" ""Who got the money I lost?"" ""Why did it happen?"" ""Who's to blame?"" ""What can I do about it?"" ""Will it happen again, and how can I keep it from happening to me?""</p>
<p>Mills compares the U.S. Internet bubble with events in Germany, where an Internet bubble also arose—but with radically different and far less serious consequences. Drawing on the same ideas, he also offers the first detailed analysis of the Enron collapse. Then Mills presents a specific, rigorous analytical structure for helping investors avoid future bubbles—as well as the first detailed proposals for effective reform.</p>

Do you eat when you're feeling sad? Do you eat just for the sake of eating? If you do, you do not have an eating problem. You have a brain chemistry problem -- a glitch in your hunger switch. In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, diet specialist Paul Rivas, M.D., shows how the excessive hunger that creates weight gain is a direct result of erroneous brain chemistry messages which turn on your hunger switch. Turn it off, and your hunger -- and weight problem -- disappears. Dr. Rivas's revoltionary no-diet, no-exercise plan places you into one of the following types: You are a type ""N"" with a norepinephrine deficiency if: You feel tired frequently and blame your fatigue for your weight. Your weight climbs for no apparent reason. You are a type ""S"" with a serotonin deficiency if: You crave chocolate. You eat out of boredom. You eat large quantities of food at one sitting. You are a type ""D"" with a dopamine deficiency if: You continue to crave salt or sweets even after various medications have been tried; You are easily distracted. You are a type ""C"" with a carbohydrate sensitivity if: You can't lose weight even if you have excellent appetite control; Low-calorie diets don't work; You strongly crave mainly carbohydrates like pasta and bread.
<p> In Turn Off the Hunger Switch, Dr. Rivas leads you on the discovery of your personal hunger buttons and shows you the methods by which you can turn them on and off at will. Ninety percent of Dr. Rivas' 10,000 patients have successfully lost weight and maintained their weight loss for years by following his unique plan which uses safe, well-tested, doctor-prescribed medications, nutrients, or natural supplements to bring hunger and cravings under immediate control. And it really is as easy as flicking a switch.</p>"

<li>Featuring examples from the author's own designs and installations</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast, solid, and secure Windows 2000 networks don't happen by chance—they happen by design!</p>
<p>It's not the hardware. It's not even the software ... by far, the most vital component of any Windows 2000 network is the design work performed before it goes online. Drawing on his extensive experience in designing Windows 2000 networks for major companies, top networking expert Ed Wilson explains everything you need to do before you connect even a single cable. With real-world examples, deployment options, and scenario-based solutions from actual cases, Wilson guides you through the entire design process. When you roll out your network, you'll know you've left nothing to chance.</p>
<p>Taking a unique project management approach, Designing Windows 2000 Networks covers preliminary considerations, migration and deployment strategies, business considerations, technology integration, domain management, security concerns, and troubleshooting, as well as Active Directory, DNS issues, DHCP, WINS, and more. Best of all, <i>Designing Windows 2000 Networks</i> comes with Wilson's hands-on style and trademark sense of humor. You'll not only learn more than you thought there was to know about Windows 2000 network design, you'll have fun doing so. This book was written to give a thorough, working knowledge of the topic, including how to design a network that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet your company's cost and operational goals</li>
<li>Allow for a smooth migration fromyour present system</li>
<li>Be performance and security optimized</li>
<li>Provide for straightforward troubleshooting</li>
</ul>
<p>Network administrators, consultants, system architects, technicians, and anyone else thinking about deploying a Windows 2000 network will find <i>Designing Windows 2000 Networks</i> an indispensable companion. Using real-world examples, author Ed Wilson, a top authority on designing and implementing Windows 2000 networks, shows you exactly what to anticipate at every step along the way, from planning to migration to implementation to troubleshooting and beyond.</p>"

                        <p>IBM may be the Rodney Dangerfield of computing. IBM turns out one world-class product after another, but you wouldn't always realize it from reading the trade press. Take, for example, IBM's Net.Commerce PRO 3.1.1, a web commerce platform with awesome power and flexibility. If you've ever shopped at L.L. Bean online, you've used Net.Commerce.

<p>Written with IBM's product developers, this is a detailed look at what it takes to build a Net.Commerce site, from shopping carts to security, catalogs to search features. You'll walk through planning a store, and then each option for creating it, including the Store Creator -- essentially, a Wizard for building entire stores in a single bound. You'll establish security, and create your store's catalog, either from new or existing data. There's also comprehensive coverage of working with the Net.Commerce web development and programming tools -- stuff you can't find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Rarely has there been an e-commerce deployment guide of any type with this much detail and sophistication. Even if you're using another platform, you'll find quite a bit of value here. If you're considering Net.Commerce -- either the START or PRO editions -- this book is utterly essential.</p>
