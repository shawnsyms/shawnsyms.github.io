"Me, Stressed Out? (peanuts Wisdom)",['Charles M Schulz'],"""It seems beyond the comprehension of people that someone can be born to draw comic strips, but I think I was,"" said Charles M. Schulz, creator of PEANUTS. ""My ambition from earliest memory was to produce a daily comic strip."" And that was exactly what Schulz did everyday since PEANUTS debuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 26, 1922, Schulz was nicknamed ""Sparky"" after Barney Google's horse ""Sparkplug."" He began his fascination with comic strips early, reading the Sunday comics from four different newspapers with his father each week. With encouragement from his father, a barber, and his mother, Schulz enrolled in a correspondence course in cartooning at what is now the Art Instruction School, Inc. in Minneapolis. His career in cartooning was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the Army and soon embarked for Europe in the fight against Germany. Upon his return, Schulz landed his first job in cartooning at Timeless Topix, a Catholic comic magazine. Soon after, he took on a second job as a teacher at Art Instruction, where he worked with Charlie Brown, Linus and Frieda, who later lent their names to the PEANUTS comic strip. Schulz's first break came in 1947 when he sold a cartoon feature called ""Li'l Folks"" to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ""Li'l Folks"" ran as a weekly feature for two years. In 1948 he sold a cartoon panel to the Saturday Evening Post and would go on to sell 15 more panels between 1948-50. In 1950, after many mailbox rejections, Schulz boarded a train from St. Paul to New York with a handful of drawings for a meeting with United Feature Syndicate. On October 2 of that year, PEANUTS, named by the syndicate,debuted in seven newspapers. When asked if he thought the strip would be a success, Schulz replied, ""Sure, I thought it would last; in fact, when I started out I thought, 'I'll be drawing this for the rest of my life.'"" Almost 50 years later, PEANUTS appears in over 2,600 newspapers worldwide and Charles M. Schulz has become a household name. The strip has maintained its universal appeal throughout five distinctly different decades. ""As a youngster, I didn't realize how many Charlie Browns there were in the world,"" said Schulz. ""I thought I was the only one. Now I realize that Charlie Brown's goofs are familiar to everybody, adults and children alike."" Schulz would work six weeks ahead on daily and Sunday strips and, unlike many cartoonists, drew every comic strip without the assistance of an art staff. He also wrote all the scripts and storyboards for the PEANUTS television specials, earning him five Emmy and two Peabody Awards, and was involved in all aspects of the PEANUTS publishing and licensing programs through United Media Licensing in New York. His company, Creative Associates, was formed in 1970 to handle his business affairs and assist in maintaining the high quality standards associated with PEANUTS. Obviously, even after producing almost 18,000 comic strips, Schulz remained dedicated to PEANUTS. When questioned about the overwhelming devotion to his work, Schulz explained, ""Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."" Among other numerous honors, Schulz received two Reuben Awards from the National Cartoonists Society (Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Humor Strip) and was inducted into the Cartoonist Hall of Fame. Although the strip remained his first love, Schulz was an avid sports enthusiast with a long-time passion for golf (he regularly participated in the Pro Am at Pebble Beach, California). He also enjoyed tennis. Above all, he loved ice-skating and the game of hockey, and was the only non-hockey professional to be presented the coveted Lester Patrick Award for his contributions to the game. To share skating with his community, he built the Redwood Empire Ice Arena near his home in Santa Rosa, California. On February 12, 2000, Charles Schulz died in Santa Rosa, CA, of complications from colon cancer. It was only hours before his last original strip was to appear in Sunday papers. His wife, Jeannie, his five children, two stepchildren, and their families survive him."
Healing: A Journal Of Tolerance And Understanding,"['Muhammad Ali', 'Thomas Hauser', 'Richard Dominick']","""Muhammad Ali is the most loved person in the world. Everywhere he goes, wherever he goes, people of all colors and religions crowd around, hoping to get close to him. I've seen it happen so many times, and each time, I ask myself, 'If we can all get together and have a meeting of the minds on Ali, why can't we all get together, period?' I look at this man and I say to myself, 'God is trying to tell us something.'"" -- Thomas Hauser 
<p><i>Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding</i> Is a joint project by Muhammad Ali and Thomas Hauser (who authored the international bestsellers <i>Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times</i> and <i>Muhammad Ali: In Perspective</i>), as part of a multi-dimensional, international campaign to combat bigotry and prejudice.</p>
<p>This beautifully designed hardcover journal has been fashioned to encourage its readers to reflect on issues of tolerance, brotherhood and understanding. An introductory essay, written by Ali and Hauser, discusses these powerful issues and promotes empathy and awareness. Subsequent pages of the journal contain one or more illuminating quotations by a philosopher, a public figure or from a religious text, with space available on alternate pages for the reader to record his or her own thoughts.</p>
<p><i>Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding</i> can help each of us make a difference and Muhammad Ali is the ideal person to teach us how. Ali and Hauser's message is simple: ""If today's world is to be truly to be healed, that healing must be achieved one person at a time. The tolerance and understanding necessary to heal must come from each and every one of us, arising out of our everyday conduct, until decency reaches a flood tide.""</p>
<p>Thomas Hauser is the author of nineteen books, both fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times</i>, which was hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as ""The definitive Ali biography, incomparable and indispensable."" The book was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and was awarded the prestigious William Hill book of the year prize in England. Hauser's books are read worldwide in eighteen languages. He lives in Manhattan.</p>"
The Secret Lives Of Elves & Faeries: From The Private Journal Of The Rev. Robert Kirk,['John Matthews'],"""This is one of the most sought after and enigmatic texts about Celtic fairies. Written by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Kirk, in 1691, and not committed to print until the early 19th century, The Secret Commonwealth is an unusually sympathetic account of the denizens of fairyland, and a complex of still mysterious extrasensory phenomena including poltergeists, clairvoyance and doppelgangers (here called 'co-walkers')."""

Hardcore Troubadour: The Life And Near Death Of Steve Earle,['Lauren St John'],"<p>If Steve Earle weren't a living, breathing person he'd be a character in a blues song, a raucous ballad that would tell the tale of a gifted rebel who drank too much, lost his career and almost all of his women in a blizzard of heroin and crack-cocaine addiction, and lived wildly and extravagantly on the wrong side of the law.</p>
<p>Along the way, Earle has welded rock to country, the Beatles to Springsteen, Celtic to Americana, punk to bluegrass and has produced multiple Grammy-nominated albums and one enduring classic: Guitar Town. Like Hank Williams and Robert Johnson he has wandered across the American South; like Janis Joplin he has a huge capacity for self-destruction that matches an appetite for life in all its extremes. Like Stephen Foster, he is a storyteller and songwriter of rare skill and force whose sincerity echoes through all his work.</p>
<p>A heroin addict since the age of fourteen, six times married to five different women, a man who took a four-year 'vacation in the ghetto', Steve Earle none the less survived. And he came back with an artistic and personal vision intact, determined to change society for the better even as he seemed set to live his life for the worse.</p>
<p>Lauren St John has been allowed unrestricted access and cooperation by Steve, his family and friends. In exchange, she has written a hauntingly clear-eyed, unvarnished and uncompromising life of one of American music's talismanic sons.</p>"

How to Think About God: A Guide for the 20th-Century Pagan,['Mortimer J. Adler'],"Dr. Adler, in his discussion, extends and modernizes the argument for the existence of God developed by Aristotle and Aquinas. Without relying on faith, mysticism, or science (none of which, according to Dr. Adler, can prove or disprove the existence of God), he uses a rationalist argument to lead the reader to a point where he or she can see that the existence of God is not necessarily dependent upon a suspension of disbelief. Dr. Adler provides a nondogmatic exposition of the principles behind the belief that God, or some other supernatural cause, has to exist in some form. Through concise and lucid arguments, Dr. Adler shapes a highly emotional and often erratic conception of God into a credible and understandable concept for the lay person."

Requiem For The Heartland: The Oklahoma City Bombing,"['Cohen', 'David']","In an age of constant and instantaneous visual communication, we see disasters and calamities played out before our eyes every day. Images of plane crashes and typhoons, famines and war, murders and abuse come tumbling into our homes with soul-numbing regularity. 
<p>But the April 19, 1995, terrorist blast in Oklahoma City was somehow different. This wasn't Bosnia or Rwanda or even New York City. This was the heart of America. And if little children could not be completely safe at 9:02 in the morning in the America's Kids day care center in Oklahoma City, we all knew in a flash that none of us could ever be completely safe anywhere.</p>
<p>When we got over our initial shock, most Americans wondered, ""What can I do to help?"" There came a great outpouring of aid and concern. Rescuers flew to Oklahoma City from all over the country. Money and supplies were sent. Condolence posters were signed in 62 shopping malls. Prayers were sent over the Internet. Cards and letters arrived by the truckload. Enough flowers were sent to provide fresh bouquets for every household in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>We believe that it was America's reaction to the event, more than the event itself, that defines who we are. A few evil people blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, but it was a multitude of good-hearted Americans who came to the rescue and picked up the pieces. As often happens, it was the worst among us who managed to bring out our best.</p>
<p>More than 20 photographers contributed their film to make this book. As professionals, they must remain detached from the horror they witness, but this professional necessity does not stop them from caring deeply. This book was born of a desire on the part of the photographers, editors, writers, publishers, printers and bookstores to give something back, to somehow help the people who suffered.</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to the victims and their families and to all of the heroes of Oklahoma City (Editor's Note ).</p>"
Why I Am a Muslim : An American Odyssey,['Asma Gull Hasan'],"In the wake of 9-11, the activities of Osama Bin Laden and Hamas, and the recent Gulf War, the Western press have been filled with information and mis-information about the true nature of Islam. Is it a feudal misogynist belief system that is a threat to Western values? Is it an ideology of oppression? Or, is it a faith tradition that is as varied as Christianity, a big tent that includes not only the extremists that we read about in the daily press, but also a majority of followers who are committed to an authentic spirituality that embraces many of the values shared by the mainstream in Europe and America? Why I Am a Muslim is a gentle analysis of those issues. Part memoir and part guide, it represents the side of Islam that is left out of the daily newspapers. For Asma Hasan, being a Muslim is not merely a matter of birth, but a matter of choice. In seven chapters, she presents seven reasons why she is committed to Islam and why it is a viable spiritual option for anyone.<p> Based on her understanding of the Qur'an and her upbringing as a Muslim, she articulates a vision of Islam that is ethnically diverse, tolerant of others, and supportive of the rights of women. She presents a spiritual tradition that contains a rich mystical tradition and that allows individuals to have a direct relationship with God. Why I Am a Muslim is an important book that will provide readers everywhere with an understanding and appreciation of a frequently misunderstood religious tradition. Hasan successfully articulates a vision of one of the world's great religions that readers within and without Islam will find engaging and challenging.</p>"
Muhammad Ali In Perspective,"['Thomas Hauser', 'Muhammad Ali']","It wasn't easy, doing what Ali did in Atlanta. But this is a man who, all his life, has come up with one incredibly gutsy performance after another. There was no way he could beat Sonny Liston. So he went out and beat Sonny Liston. There was no way he'd give up his title. So as an act of principle, he gave up the heavyweight championship of the world. He beat George Foreman, when everyone knew he couldn't. He won the heavyweight crown for a third time, against Leon Spinks, when he was too old to win. Each time the world thought Ali was out of miracles, he performed another miracle. That's Muhammad Ali, In Perspective. And what you had in Atlanta was a wonderful reaffirmation of just how much Muhammad Ali means to the world. Three billion people were watching. Three billion people were in love with one man. Three billion people, even if it was just for a moment, had all the hate and petty prejudices removed from their hearts, and felt nothing but love. That's a miracle."

A Witness To Genocide: The 1993 Pulitzer Prize-winning Dispatches On The Ethnic Cleansing Of Bosnia,['Roy Gutman'],"Straight from today's front-page headlines comes this shocking firsthand account of the current genocide perpetrated by Bosnia's Serbs against that country's Muslims. A Witness to Genocide is a compilation of Newsday foreign correspondent Roy Gutman's reports from Bosnia, which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. Gutman and photographer Andree Kaiser (whose photos illustrate this book) were the first Western journalists to visit the death camps, and Gutman was the first to interview the survivors and report on the atrocities that were taking place there. His articles were partly responsible for the United Nations' condemnation of the camps and insistence that the International Red Cross be allowed to inspect them. The articles include survivors' accounts of being transported to the camps in cattle cars in which many died of starvation or suffocation, the systematic murder of prisoners, the government-ordered rape of all Muslim girls and women, and the destruction of the six-hundred-year-old Muslim cultural heritage, including over half of all mosques, historical sites, and libraries. Not since the Holocaust have such widespread, blatant, and unrestrained atrocities been committed against a defenseless minority. The articles are framed by a comprehensive prologue in which the recent history and breakup of Yugoslavia are explained, and an epilogue in which Gutman gives his recommendations on how to put a stop to this ongoing tragedy, and prevent others in its wake."
