i connected with this video on a personal level.. i think it’s because of my short attention span. it’s like the video was synced up to my mind. every time the guy “passed out” i either zoned out or straight up disassociated from myself completely

those background noises is something similar to what is going on in the back of my head when i’m fucked up AND sober. it’s crazy. it seemed like real life for me, how i see the world sometimes, is that weird? (it probably is, meh) 

but the best part is that my shit kicked in right as the video started and i got higher as i was watching the video and everything was just great.

(also my stuff is kicking in even more as i’m typing this, so sorry if im not making any sense rn i’m just letting my mind go free)

gimmie some thoughts, comments, and opinions guysss: on the video and on my post obvi 

amen"
1,0,"I'm 24. I started with alcohol an tobaco early at 9. 
First time I take weed I was like 12. I was on that like 3 years of smoking almost everyday. Then I tried benzos. 
Now, at 24, I ""stop"" of taking drugs. I only smoke weed when I can't stay away from that. Last time was a week ago (I had 4 months without taking weed). The fact is that now I drink more than ever, I think is the only thing that gets me away from hard drugs. So here is the problem: I want hard drug (I wish them). I don't know why I can't move away those feelings. 
I have a good life, I'm studying the carreer I love and have and amazing and loveful girlfriend. She loves me and I love her more than anything. But I know I can't have both drugs and my girlfriend. 
So my question is why can't I stop thinking abou drugs?
I've never tried opiates, but I fucking wish them. (I wish all kind of drugs, so that's weird)
This sucks.

P.S sorry about my not so good english"

5,0,"So I'm working on a concept for an app that let's you easily keep track of your and your friend's XTC usage on a night out. You can anonymously  join or create a ""room"" (similar to Kahoot!) and add your intakes and see everybody else's in a timeline so that you can keep an eye out for each other. At the end of the night the room will be deleted so that no data will be stored. I've uploaded two early mock ups to Imgur, keep in mind these are just mock ups so nothing is final yet.

Would you use something like this? Do you have any feature suggestions that would make it more useful?"
6,0,"So I call up my so called “friend” that I usually go and pick up meth,crack, or heroin with and I got $40 so I wanna go get some ice and my old plug hasn’t been around so I’ve been going through my friends meth head friend a couple times and we get to her house and I’m wondering what’s the plan if we are gonna go pick up from her plug or she’s just gonna give me some she has left or whatever so after she’s done getting ready she comes outside and doesn’t think I’m in the car yet but then she sees me and goes into the back seat. 

Well she ends up having some “meth” and I pay her $40 for what looks like a pretty good amount ( I’m sorta new to doing ice and I only use it here and there ) so since she sold me the “last of what she had” my friend was gonna drive her down to go and pick up some more, so I’m like alright cool and I ask him if he can just drop me off at my house because I wanna get home and get nice and high, he says “yeah sure bro” and we head to my house, on the way I’m filled with so much excitement to be able to get high and just play some videos games , so after talking to them about pointless shit on the way back I’m finally at my house I get out of the car and head into my house , I don’t stop to do anything and head to my room.

I fill my cooker up with a medium amount of meth and mix it up ( nothing seemed suspicious at this point) and finally draw up all the “meth” from the cotton, I inject my self once , I feel sorta high but not what I would usually feel from that kind of shit , I say in my head “ I must have not done enough” so I do another shot , still barley anything , then another ... then another... then another , so pretty much the point is that I continued to do shot after shot until pretty much the whole bag was gone because I just wanted to feel happy and high , well you see that did not happen and after my second shot or so I texted her and my so called friend to see what the fuck is up with this shit and why it’s not getting me high.

I’m pretty much telling her that this shit is bunk and I did the whole bag and feel barley any euphoria and she goes on to tell me all this bullshit how it got her and my friend high and that if I can get a ride to her she will give me a free shot I’m just telling her that I think that she ripped me off and that she should be honest about it but she keeps on telling me she wasn’t ripping me off , it is really hard to believe because 
1.) when I was in the car I asked if I could use her pipe and she said No because of “the coronavirus “ stuff going on” and she would have normally let me use it but not this time “ because of the corona virus “ such bullshit I don’t even have it.
2.) some of the pieces taste like fucking salt.

3.) she is just shady and has tried to get over on me before by trying to make me pay more money then it actually is for whatever I’m buying and if I don’t have a certain amount she won’t even go with just to be a jerk and hold it over me.

You know this is really fucked up but hey you win some and you lose some and karma is a bitch so she will get what she deserves for being so selfish and heartless, she just only cares about her self and fueling her own habit , 
Well basically I’m not gonna really go through her anymore because she has not gained my trust one bit, but if she does give me a free shot like she said she would later today I will be less upset about having to deal with this and have my night ruined. 

I’m mad about getting screwed over and lied to I just wish more people actually wanted to help others instead of only just caring about themselves, please pray that she does follow through and gives me the free shot because that would make me not so upset about all this anymore , you know I just wanted to get a good high before I quit and try and make something of myself ,

7,0,"IM ON MOBILE SORRY 

I just need to bask in a good moment right now, I had a really intense trip off some “400ug gel tabs” that I didn’t think much of, the typical 100-150ug street tabs. But still you always gotta be careful and take just one of the new batch ((yes I should test I’m aware and I would if I could get a test shipped to me in my current situation)). Might not have been 400 micrograms but it was intense and something I’ll always remember, because right when we all got home one of us got drug tested by his parents. Obviously it wasn’t me but the dude who got drug tested was on thin ice with his parents on the topic of specifically weed as he got “caught” (long story) once before but after what felt like hours of him talking to his parents he came back to our group chat inviting us over to smoke for the first time WITH HIS PARENTS and come to find out we now have a dispensary connect to smoke as safe as we can

Now we all are just starting to experience adulthood and trying to figure out how drugs can play into that if at all and to have this happen is super encouraging to my ideal relationship with these substances. Obviously it’s just weed and his parents being cool with it because we’re all ((technically, prob not mentally let’s be real)) adults at this point but I just wanna realize that these are the best times of my life I’m living in right now despite the pandemic, and plus I’m just super excited to have a deep ass conversation with his parents about some shit only this situation could being up.

No particular reason why reddit needs to know but I think it’s important to realize the best times when they’re here 

Kinda corny but good vibes to all y’all no matter what situation you’re in APPRECIATE THE GOOD TIMES"

This was a scary situation when my brother gave me some weed in a vape, little did we both know it was synthetic weed not normal weed, I took a massive drag, held it in for a good amount of time, then exhaled, I then instantly got tunnel vision, which then led to me blacking out, I was tripping balls for about 10 - 15 minutes, but it felt like eternity, I didnt know what was happening, I then awoke, I was still feeling a bit trippy - I could recall seeing my bones &amp; veins glowing in my hand LOL, I threw up twice &amp; then was quite tired for the rest of the day, although I have thought about it every now &amp; then over the past 2 years, it really hasnt mentally affected me, I have been perfectly fine, and am just lucky to not have any negative mental health affects that could have possibly happened after that event. I am just curious, what happened? Does synthetic weed actually make you trip that hard? like is it a kind of a psychedelic? because I was seriously tripping the fuck out seeing all different shapes, colours, voices I dont even know, could it be that I took way to much at a young age? or was it even synthetic weed? my brother said he found out it was, but who knows.

19,0,"so i’ve tried codeine a few times, oxy once at a low dose so i wanted to try an kinda in the middle opiate, so i went for dihydro, it came from the onion patch yesterday morning and i did some research, it was my birthday 3 days ago and i was in isolation so i wanted to get super fucked up and took 300mv (10x30mg).
 
The come up was amazing, it took about an hour so i played some gta and listened to peep, it felt like codeine but stronger, my body was full with euphoria and it was the most blissful experience i could’ve ever imagined.

All of a sudden things took a turn for the worse, i started shaking, super dizzy, couldn’t type or see straight so i made a reddit post and lots of poeple helped me so thank you for that. it was extremely overwhelming, i called a friend of mine who is a doctor and she calmed me down and helped me, i drunk some water, sat up straight and tried to ride the wave.


i must’ve blacked out around 1am ish according to my message history, i had about 10 CRAZY and i mean CRAzy vivid dreams, felt like absolutely reality and i could control myself completely it was surreal, i woke up every hour or so as i set an alarm just incase j puked up in my sleep or something, but these dreams man, i cant explain them, they were crazy.

overall it’s shaken me a lot, 300mg if dihydro may not seem a lot to you, but for me with no tolerance it has fucked me up, the opioid high is a godsend, but from now on i’m staying well away from it.

My question is what amount of super fine powdered mdma would I have to snort that would make me super happy yet normal and cognitive enough to call 911.

38,0,"Hey r/Drugs,

I'm a freelance UI Designer and I'd like to introduce a personal project I've been working on over the quarantine: TripBuddy. I got bored and started to brainstorm an idea to modernize the way harm reduction information is shared: [https://imgur.com/a/eDX5CAi](https://imgur.com/a/eDX5CAi) (Example screenshots and Demo)

I got inspired by my own experience where I would constantly check Psychonautwiki trying to understand what was happening, juggling through my notes app, and learning everything about drugs/research chemicals for the first time. It was a steep learning curve, mostly because every site I saw was mostly a drug rehab site and trying to scare me away from learning about it, which puts me off from what I already plan to do. TripSit, Psychonautwiki, Erowid, and others piqued my interest because it gave information unbiasedly, which is exactly what I was looking for, but it felt overwhelming with the amount of information it had on the site. With all of that in mind, I wanted to see if I could tackle the problem though design.

This is where TripBuddy comes into play, it's the one stop app you'd want to use for each trip because it's a personalized guide for your trips. The same way you'd use Google Maps for a trip on the road, you'd use TripBuddy for a trip through your mind.

From the start, I wanted to tackle these four design challenges:

* It's easy enough to use that you can give it to a first time user without overwhelming them.
* It doesn't discourage or encourage drug use, rather it just helps you understand what you're currently on.
* It lets you understand more about what you took and specifically when it should affect you.
* It looks and feels like a regular app, so that it's easy to share and encourage others to safely trip when using the app.

I accomplished this by integrating a modern look (heavily inspired by Samsung's One UI) to look familiar and colorful to users. This also helps with first-time users as it doesn't seem overwhelmingly complex. The app also acts as a trip enhancer, the same way you'd use a notes app or camera. It also allows for an interactive timeline to keep you in an estimated loop of how the drug phases should be affecting you. And lastly, it's easily accessible as an app, so if you're tripping with someone new, you can suggest for them to download this app and they understand what they're taking and do it safely.

I'd love to make this an actual app, but I want to get some feedback if this is something people would be interested in using.

So r/Drugs....what do y'all think?"

When eating I could see a cross section of my throat with lumps of food going down. When i lied down and closed my eyes I was seeing what felt like a moving 3d “slice” of 4d space. That somehow looped in and out of me seeing my body from the outside, a floating viewpoint slowly rotating around it. I could see inside my body and there were hollow tunnels running through my limbs and joining in my torso. There were white spheres moving thought the tunnels, I could feel them in my body.

45,0,"I found some histamine at a chemical vendor and decided to try it as a drug for the sake of experimentation.  I have not expecting any psychoactive effects, but did this to observe its effects on the sinuses.  I have done extensive research on histamine, and was eager to discover a potential decongestant.  I measured a tiny amount of it and snorted it.  For some reason, it smelled like fish.  Within about 30 seconds, my face started itching like crazy, and I got a bit flushed.  This faded really quickly, and was replaced with very strong sense of well being and crisp, clear focus and euphoria.  I just felt very awake and energetic in a clean and non-forceful manner.  I noticed the desired effect of very clear nasal passages.  These effects lasted all day, and did not seem to crash.  The next day....well that's a whole other story.  The moment I woke up, I was extremely dizzy and I had a splitting tension headache.

This post is about one of my close friend. He also went to therapy(couple years ago) and was hospitalised recently because he wanted to kill himself .. He out of the hospital got some ressources but that did not seem to do much difference.. 
He does a lot of ketamine. I know he cant accualy die from a ket od. My concern is here, he feels fine for some time but i know he isnt all that fine inside you know? We talked about it alot. Me and him, and his sister and me( we all are close to each other ).But for a while now hes not just been getting high.. he just rails 1g(sometimes even up to 2.5) in 5 mins and then he just loses it. He says that he tries to just end it with a fat rail..recently he started talking us about trying to shoot up. Thats why im writing this post.. he can do whatever he wants its not for me to tell him what to do i know that.. i just support him the best way i can given the circumstances.. im really worried that if he tries that and you know ketamine is a disociative. If he gets high and then cranks up im scared hes gonna do this wrong and shoot up a air bubble or whatever. I know it has to come from him and we cant make him not use. We seeked proffesional help. We support him, we try to make his consomation less frequent the best way we can. His parents are just as worried we talked to them also. Maybe im just over reacting but i know how it feels to be in that place. I went through all of that with my own addiction already so i kinda know how he feels. I cant just sit by and watch my buddy die. I spoke to his dealer ( wich is an old friend of mine) so he wouldnt sell him crazy amounts and he agreed , but he has 3 other that i dont know at all.. im passing some details here but i think we did all we could for now.. cant just put my mind on leaving things there and wait to see what comes out of it. 

I dont want a magic trick to make him stop,i know there isnt one. i just want to have you guys opinion on what could i do or not do to deal with this situation... Huge thanks to everyone

its gotten to the point where ill take molly as soon as i wake up, ill sometimes take more at school, and then some more after school before i have to go to work, and usually ill take more after i get home from work at night. there are times ill get fucked up on ft calls with my friends and take like 6 more tablets in a day (sometimes amounting to me consuming about 5-10 tablets of ecstasy in a single day).

61,0,"On the weekend I decided it’d be a good idea to get some cold and flu tablets to help me through work as I was a bit sick. The ones I purchased contained 30mg pseudoephedrine and 15mg dxm. I had a bottle of robitussin in the cupboard so thought I’d give the dxm a little boost before work. It really hit me strong, and at work I was popping 2 cold and flu every hour or 2 and went through about a sheet until my manager realised I was fucked (more the dxm) and was offered to go home early.  

When I got home I poured up some wine, chopped up a mix and had some phenergan (200mg) to help me sleep. I didn’t think much of it because I do that most nights, but it must have all reacted bad with the dxm and pseudo. 

That’s the last thing I remember doing but apparently had eaten 15 or so 5mg oxybutynin tablets. These are a strong anticholonergics and really trip me out on 4 so 15 left me in a catatonic state. I don’t remember anything, but according to the ambulance workers who my family called and a video recorded of me  I was writing invisible stuff and picking at invisible things on the floor and writhing around speaking jibberish. 

The next 2 days I was confined to the hospital unable to sign myself out even after I sobered up because they had to verify it wasn’t a suicide attempt and that I wasn’t a danger to myself or anyone else. 

I’ve really disappointed my family but it was honestly a mistake to combine those drugs. I’ve been sick lately and so the cold and flu and robitussin were recommended to me at the time by a pharmacist, just not in those doses 😬
And the added with alcohol and phenergan to help me sleep blacked me out enough to take the oxy which I had no intention of taking in the first place. I guess I can’t blame anyone but myself though. 

But lesson learned, I need to be more careful with drugs, especially combinations."

64,0," 

I bought a 300mg pill from a friend, took half of it at around 9:30PM, it kicked in at 11.

Then I took the other half at 12:15 and whilst I was casually searching for a song to send my stoner friend on discord at around 2, I felt my mind explode into full euphoria all of a sudden The second half had kicked in.

I felt like my whole body and head was weightless, until 6am I was chatting, listening to music and feeling out of this world.

I'm not sure how the comedown is supposed to be, but I ate a banana beforehand and whilst the high has subsided a bit now, I'm not feeling a sign of any comedown. I think I've been blessed with the elusive afterglow as well as I feel all around warm and fuzzy and today music is still art to my ears.

I read overdoing it could fry your brain and remove this magic feeling or have you need to wait even longer for it.

How long should I realistically need to wait to reach that insane high I just had + that mellow, smooth and wonderful comedown?

I dosed yesterday night. Is not touching it at all for 3 months sufficient in reality?

78,0,"The COVID-19 epidemic has been a true test for VCAM in our mission to serve our patients, who need care and support more than ever. Over the past few weeks, the team at the Virginia Center for Addiction Medicine has never lost its focus or dedication. In contrast, it has grown stronger, more resolute, and more committed to fighting the disease of addiction by meeting this challenge head on.

Each member of our team has been willing to work more hours and meet each and every challenge in the transition to a totally new way of providing care. While making the adjustment to a remote work environment, our providers began seeing patients via telehealth, and have continued to accept new patients that need help. It took true teamwork to make the necessary changes in our continuum of care, from our peer recovery coaches, our therapy team, and our physician and NP addiction medicine providers. Our administrative support staff have also been instrumental in guiding our patients through how to complete their visits using the Zoom video app while making in-person aspects of a visit, such as check-in and check-out, a virtual process. This transition is an incredible example of adapting our model to the needs of our patients, made possible by the contributions of each team member. It reminds me again of what I love most about our VCAM team—the passion and dedication for doing the extra work to help our patients progress in their recovery journey.

Teamwork is the most vital aspect of any organization at any time—not to mention, just about anything we do as human beings. This fact is never more evident than when our communities across the world are faced with difficult times. We can all agree that now is one of those times. And while the world struggles at this very moment, we are keenly aware of the resilience of the individuals working together all around us in every community.

To our own team, we say: You make us proud. You make us hopeful. And you make us aware that it is possible to overcome even the largest challenges that we face when we work together!

It’s during difficult periods of time like this that good healthcare teams band together and find new and creative ways to move forward for the benefit of the patients they serve. With that in mind, we are extending our heartfelt gratitude to our entire team. Their compassion, tenacity, and ability to come together during unprecedented times gives us hope for the future and confidence that together we as a community will overcome the current health crisis.

I would give a solid 10/10, because it didn't give me anxiety (it's an anti-anxiety drug duh) and also the effects were not overpowering, just a body high and relaxation. I guess now I know that the most addictive drugs are the ones that don't really cause any dysphoric effects and only nice ones.

My question is why do I have so much ambition to follow my “dreams” when I’ve consumed a couple beers or a couple drinks? Especially when I do cocaine and alcohol. But when I’m sober I have no ambition. 

It seems like a loop kinda. I drink for many different reasons, a lot of the time to just have fun. I also drink a lot more than I should just for the ambition factor of it. Might be a very very stupid question but why can’t I feel this productive and ambitious sober? Is there any possible way I can bring it over to me being sober? I am tending to drink more now because I feel like I get more done and have better productivity"

As far as I’m aware 11-20mg of vyvanse equals = 10mg of adderal? 

My question is how can I split this up into multiple doses if even possible. Just pop the cap open and chop some lines? Volumetrically dose it?? Any help is appreciated.

I am always tensed up and i even have a swallowing tic (globulus) which has been - and is exhausting me. Benzos relieve all this and the muscle relaxation, not to mention my swallowing habits - gone. Im happy.

Now, I am responsible enough to not do them everyday or to abuse them, although I hate the whole nervous mindset and tight swallowing, apparantly it is wbo i am, without drugs

I haven’t taken one of these pills in years but decided to because of a bad migraine. The next day after I took it I did an extreme HIT workout which had me profusely sweating. I also drank about 2-3 gallons of water during the day. This morning before the interview and drug test, I did the same workout and was once again sweating profusely and I drank a large amount of water.

102,0,"Okay so I bought a bunch of 2mg alprazolam bars from somebody I don't trust. When I ate half of one and smushed it all around my mouth i tasted a very tiny bit of that delicious benzo chemical, but it was pretty chalky and the chemical taste was very faint. When I broke it in half, it was a soft break. They look legit and everything, but I am almost certain that it was pressed. 

Now here is where things get a little out of control. The person I was with was convinced that it was pressed with fentanyl. I've never done fentanyl before, but am all about chasing a high if the situation is good enough for it. After I took 1mg of the stuff I had a few beers to see what was going on. I was definitely feeling relaxed. Relaxed enough to try snorting the other half. Did that felt great. So great that I decided to crush up another 1mg and smoke that. NOW I was pretty fucked up especially after a 6 pack of beers on top of that. We broke out the needle and measuring spoons and some 80prof alcohol and dissolved the powder, then each banged it in our arms. The time flew. The next thing I knew I woke up 12 hours later feeling ABSOLUTELY FUCKING AMAZING. I had some coffee and was productive today expecting to catch some anxiety and a bad comedown to hit, but I still feel on top of the world. Not a care in the world. 

I know these decisions are not smart and it probably won't happen like this again, but can anybody please explain to me why I feel so good still? Does it sound like it was fentanyl? What else could it be?"

***TEST YOUR SHIT. WAITING AN EXTRA WEEK AND PAYING 20$ FOR A TEST KIT IS WAY BETTER THAN GETTING FUCKED BY A RANDOM CHEMICAL.*** 

Hey guys, 

A little back story. It was August, 2019. Rents went up to Michigan for a week, school was starting the following week and I met up with a college friend of mine who began selling weed and got his hands on some strips of ""LSD"", said they were double dipped 375ug whatever, I didn't believe that shit to be honest, tabs are tabs and chances of this guy knowing the actual yield were 1 in 1000. Long story short, we smoked mad with each other and I picked up two tabs, one for my cousin and one for myself. It was Thursday, so the plan was to party up Friday and trip Saturday. Have a trip before school started and enjoy the end of the summer. 

Friday night I decided to test the tab by cutting mine into a fifth, so basically took a sliver of it and microdosed. This is standard practice with me whenever I get something from new sources. Euphoria was awesome, basically had god mode energy during the microdose. We were balling up playing soccer and I was banging in upper 90's like nothing, or at least I thought I was haha. No visuals. 

So I figured shit was cool. Was gonna take the full thing next day. Next day came around and my cousin lets me know he got way too fucked up the night before and no way he was tripping on a mega-hangover. Said alright, I'll just trip by myself with a buddy of mine trip sitting. I took the rest of the tab and **holy shit. This was not acid.** There was no come up. No euphoria. Just, madness. No hallucinations, just pure static. It couldn't really be described. I asked my buddy to leave before the peak for whatever reason, I tried to write but I literally couldn't do anything but scribble. It got to the point where I was not enjoying it at all and was pacing around the house just in pure confusion. I ended up barring out to pull me out of the trip by taking a single xanax and for the rest of the night I was basically traumatized. 

Anyway, a few days pass and I'm totally cool. Just not thinking about it and acknowledge it as a bad ass trip. I thought I temporarily went insane, but that doesn't make sense since I had the coherence to take the bar and know it would pull me out, plus I knew I was not enjoying it since this was not a trip, just blatant confusion. A few weeks ago I found what i was (attempting) to write and I scribbled in there ""Things don't make sense right now, but I'll be fine once the LSD wares off."" I got through my first quarter at school no problem. Started learning German, taking advanced eco classes, just challenging myself like I always did. For about two or three months everything was totally cool. I did notice that the buddy that sold me the shit went totally off the face of the Earth. He was taking these things basically almost every night and went AWOL for a good few months. I figured he might've been arrested or things caught up to him. 

Then one night, dabbing up, I just feel like something goes blatantly wrong in the back of my head. Not like a voice, or hallucination, but that my ego just feels detached, maybe my first bout of DP/DR. I haven't really felt the same since that one night. This was around late November, early December. I think I just got waaaayyyyyy too fuckin high, but since then shit's been super weird. I'll look up at the sky and I'll see little mosquitoes flying around everywhere, if I smoke too much weed/dabs I'll start getting wild CEV's like seeing the circle of life just appear infinitely in the darkness, things are static-y at night. Shit sucks, went looking for answers.

Around this time my buddy that sold me the shit was back on snapchat, so I hit him up, we catch up and I ask him what happened. He basically explains he was having a massive bought of anxiety and other issues after his dealings so he went off the grid temporarily. Tells me the shit he was selling was not legit apparently, so I'm pretty sure I got fucked with an N bomb or something worse. 

I guess I just wanna share my story and ask others their perspectives on how to beat this thing. I know with a good mindset and not smoking weed or taking psychs for a long time will heal this, I'm 20 years old and aware that neuroplasticity does wonders. I just hope I'll be able to smoke weed again someday without going on a trip haha. Thing is though, I never had these weird flashback type things until that one bad high I had months after the initial trip. Responses are more than welcome and appreciated. Trip well &amp; safely friends =)."
121,0,"So I ordered a batch of a 100 grams of kratom with 200 big empty capsules because i cant stand drinking kratom sludge anymore.

Kratom is amazing to use sometimes not Everyday  because of tolerance with every Day use you cant up the dose or you Will just feel sick and tired. But I used to always drink my kratom either with some warm water or yoghurt drink and at some days i could handle it and some days i puked everything out. But it works amazing when you get though that shit.

But now after long time no use of kratom i decided to try and make capsules out of it and it doesnt seem to work like it always does. Right now im on like 8 grams of kratom i took a shit ton of pills like a few hours ago and i feel gud relaxed and a little dreamy wich is good because i wanna sleep.

And now back to the point 8 grams is a shit ton if i drank 8 grams i wouldnt be able to walk up the stairs anymore or even get up out of bed because of the heavy nausea but when i layed down i felt amazing.
But in capsules no nausea seems to bother me but i also feel like i don't get the effects i have with drinking it.

So my question do you guys feel difference between capsules and drinking swamp sludge or is it just me?"

I know people with mental health problems sometimes can't do drugs like if u have schizophrenia in your family u can't do hallucinogens cause it will become less dormant, she doesnt have that but Idk if it would make her do something similar because bipolar

132,0," Hello everyone, 

When preparing to boof some ritalin IR, i put them in water and waited a bunch.

Now the solution has **2 parts:**

1. almost clear water (slightly 'grey-ish')
2. white powder on the bottom of the glass

**Now my question is** \-&gt; *What part should i boof?*

1. the water? (seems too 'clear' to have active substance in it i think)
2. the powder at the bottom? (seems logical to me as this 'looks more like drugs')

135,0,"I have been using ketamine about once a month (about a gram over the course of a week) for the past 3 months. I have noticed it helped me with some productivity issues caused by my depression. I’ve had a depressive episode for years but the past 2 years it has taken a toll on my focus/attention. I’ve used ketamine to get some things done before (projects, papers, tasks) but never for studying. Is this a good idea? I already have it, and I will probably end up using it. So how can i best approach this? My test is due tomorrow. 
tldr: I have ketamine and I am planning to use it for studying. Is this a good idea? If so, are there any tips or precautions I should take?"

Hello fellow redditors!

My friend is struggling with an addiction to kratom and lately they have reached out to me and told me about their problem. I, of course, listened and tried to understand where they are coming from. I smoke weed and take acid and shrooms as well but have never tried kratom before so I only know about the effects through what other people have told me and what I have read online. Recently my friend has been trying to quit badly bc they have seen the negative effects and want help. They told me the best way to quit is to go to rehab through a 12 step program. I am all for helping my friend trying to change something about their life in a way they see beneficial and have done as much as I can to be there and support them. During casual conversation however I don't know what to say sometimes and I like to check in on them to see how they are doing and make sure they are okay. What I'm asking for is how do I go about helping them without being so overbearing and nosey about their addiction?

Any advice, suggestions, and any recommendations for help are greatly appreciated! I want to help my friend in the best way possible!"
153,0,"Howdy folks. This is my first post on Reddit. I'm posting on here today to ask about MDMA or Molly. My experience with drugs is pretty limited. I've smoked weed plenty of times, and Carts and all that. Never taken edibles or anything. Overall just pretty recreational Marijuana use. I am super lightweight. One hit off a cart, and I'm high. Figured I would get that out of the way before asking about all this. 

So recently there's a girl, who for simplicity sake, I'm going to call my girlfriend. A couple nights ago she did Molly with her friend late at night. She had a wonderful time, as most people do from what I've heard on their first time on it. She sent me some nude photos and shit, and the next day she was fine. The next night, she did Molly again. From what she told me she took a pretty high dose this second time around. She told me she did like 50 crunches and ran around the park, climbed a tree, and didnt even feel tired afterwards. Next day, she feels fine. Then that night, she decides to do LSD. At this point, I'm kind of worrying about her drug use. What are these drugs doing to her brain? I didnt know so I decided to do some research. From what I've found out, Molly acts on the serotonin receptors in the brain, causing you to feel completely euphoric. I've heard that people have died from using this drug, people have regretted ever taking it despite the euphoric feeling because of the after effects of it. But I've also heard people have had wonderful experiences, with no drawbacks at all. 

So. She does her Molly and the LSD, and then yesterday, she tells me she is feeling really really depressed. Like she's had her fair share of trauma, and previously was on some depression medication, I forget the actual name, and she had a pretty high daily dosage. I believe she isn't taking her depression medication anymore, although I'm not sure. So she tells me she's feeling incredibly depressed, and I start to get worried. Hearing about all these peoples experiences with this drug, I just dont know what to think. She has been pretty irritable towards me recently which previously never happened. 

I dont know if there is permanent damage to her brain? I have no idea. This drug seems like it could be great, or it could be permanently scarring.  

So she tells me she wants to do Molly with me. Me, being a pretty lightweight even on Marijuana, I'm kinda not so sure its a good idea. I told her, that we would need to wait at least 6 weeks, for here serotonin levels to return to normal. The last thing I want for her is to have some sort of brain damage. I am certainly curious about the experience, but I figured I'd ask before commiting to it.

Any insight on this topic is helpful! Thanks! :)"

155,0,"Whenever I take mushrooms, I smell mushrooms the rest of the day, even after the trip ends. I thought I was maybe just making it up, but recently I have been trying microdosing, since I have a lot of mushrooms and I’m stuck at home with my family due to the pandemic. Today when I took my microdose, it smelled different than any other time I’ve taken some (guess that’s what happens when you leave mushroom water sitting under your bed for a week), kinda like the cereal bits from Lucky Charms but nasty lmao. 
Anyway, now I’ve been smelling that rancid Lucky Charm smell all day, so it feels less like my imagination. Has anyone experienced anything similar, or am I just overthinking nothing?"
156,0,"I think it's really great for me at least (the best I've gotten a hold of) but it depends on what kind of anxiety you experience. If you have acute panic attacks, all day, every day, you probably need Xanax XR, Klonopin or Valium in the very least. If you have chronic anxiety that sort of lingers around, changes in intensity but finally hits you at some point, oxazepam can be really good in helping you focus on stuff more. Relaxes muscles, may produce slight euphoria early on (not for me anymore) etc. Short half-life is good, because tolerance doesn't build as fast. Say Valium is a good example of this, which has a far longer half-life, so the stuff stays in your body, which then in turn gets used to it and you need to skip days more, before using it again. Oxazepam is also not too intense, it just gets the job done. I think that oxazepam is great for medicinal purposes, which is what I'm looking for. A more intense benzodiazepine isn't exactly what I need, because they just make me groggy. I've also had diazepam 5mg three times a day, but it only made me worse, because I abused it. Weird huh? Probably the most balanced benzo out there, and it made me worse. Anyhow for me:

My conclusion: underrated or simply doesn't suit for most people, because of their anxiety type. But I sure am loving the effect I'm getting from it right now and will not change it any other benzo."

Just because it's natural it doesn't mean it's good for you. I hear people say shit like ""weed and shrooms are natural so they're not bad"" my response is usually along the lines of ""heroin comes from poppy plants and cocaine come from cocoa leaves."" It usually shocks the person a little bit lol. But I think the worst case is when people say shrooms are ok but acid is bad cause it's ""man made"" and a ""chemical"", that shit annoys me beyond anything.

170,0,"(Throwaway obviously) So before I begin just know that I’m aware I should get an actual marquis reagent test for my molly but I kind of had a dumb idea and was wondering if anybody had any information. I’m sure most of us are aware of the 12 panel at home drug UA kits. So what if instead of urine, you poured a little molly water in that bad boy. Would the test strip for mdma read positive if any were present? And yes I know it wouldn’t test for any bad cutting agents or whatever other bs might be present in there, it’s specifically for the purpose of seeing if there’s actually any mdma present. Would this work or does it only react with urine?? Just a dumb thought I had when I was high lol. Thanks"

There have been seizure associated though. If anyone Lowe what the actual drug is I would love to hear it.

183,0,"I kinda miss Adderall, but for those newcomers without ADHD or any friends who could give them that experience, all that I know of is Benzedrex and Betel nut. Does anyone know of more? And btw, just for a background on both of them:

Benzedrex- a non-narcotic OTC inhaler for congestion that, when taken apart and used for the cotton, can produce an Adderall like high that lasts for only 5 hours. I remember seeing tons of videos on YouTube on how to extract it, but the way I did it was by repeatedly soaking and squeezing it in a cup of mountain dew and letting it sit overnight before drinking it the next morning. It tasted like vodka. I think I removed the half of the cotton swab from it before I let it sit. If anyone can find me a similar method tutorial, link it to me so I can give noobs the instructions. As for harm reduction purposes, this drug may cause severe vasoconstriction to the point of amputating limbs, so it's best that you keep a vasodilator nearby (like beer).

Betel nut - a drug similar to tobacco and speed that is chewed as a quid by taking a green nut, wrapping it in a tobacco leaf with lime flavoring (IIRC) and chewed in the mouth and the excess fluid spit out. It may cause oral cancer, similar to chew tobacco. 

Does anyone know of any more?"

187,0,"So I've done Adderall and Vyvanse since I was a kid. I know of many similar drugs, but only two are legal in the US. Namely:

Benzedrex - a non-narcotic OTC med that has similar effects to meth. You take out the cotton from inside the tubing, dip and squeeze it inside a cup of mountain dew or any other kind of citrus juice (it has to have lemon/lime in it) and let it soak overnight until you drink it the next morning. It'll taste like vodka. It's basically an Adderall high that lasts for only five hours, assuming that you've only used one half of it. But it's been said to cause such severe vasoconstriction to the point of amputating limbs, so it's best to keep a vasodilator nearby, such as beer.

Betel nuts - you chew this quid that contains some different types of leaves with a green betel nut inside it and spit out the juices like it's tobacco. From what I've heard, it's a strong stimulant that's similar to drinking six cups of coffee. It may cause mouth cancer. But otherwise it's very similar to khat in that it's a natural speed much stronger than caffeine.

I have 2.5g left and want to get the most out of them. I dont really want to do lemon tek as I like the longer duration. And honestly hate lemons. My first trip I did lemon tek and didnt have the best trip either so I just dont wanna go back to that. Granted it was 1.5g so that's just an uncomfortable trip dose.

 I have a dry herb vape and exotic grade weed. I usually smoke 2 bowls and still very much in control of everything How much should I smoke to get to around 3.5-4g trip level.

240,0,"Hey r/Drugs

I'm a pretty experienced psychonaut(M26) with some medics in my family and some minimal medical background myself.  


I prefer psychedelic group of drugs to the majority of other drug groups, due to various reasons.   


For last 4 month I have been seeing a girl(F26) which I like a lot, and I couldn't help but notice that she doesn't need much in terms of substances (apart from alcohol, perhaps, as she is more than a casual drinker).   


I recall situation when we've smoked some kush, and she pretty much did the &lt;I'M LEAVING&gt; 420 scene from standup by Louis C.K, if you remember what I'm talking about ahaha :)  


Also, I once shared some canna brownies /w her at her place , and she doesn't really recall much from the 6 hours we hung, and the following 20 hours while she was sleeping and rejuvenating were also pretty blurry.  


TL;DR   


I wanna ask you if there are some life hacks, or ways to prepare prior to her having her first tab, in my company. (She has shrooms experience, and it was ok, btw)  


What can be done to avoid lysergic bad trip? I want her to have visuals, but not over the top. I think, 80-100ug will be enough? To sum up, she is kinda senstive and susceptible to a lot mind altering, and I want this to go perfectly smooth for her."

I reached out to many coaches about going back to college and competing. woke up in the morning (forgetting nearly everything) to a phone call from a coach, packed up all my belongings and moved across the country for school in 3 days. Idk how the fuck it happened, but Xanax saved me. I am now clean, except for psychs and weed, but now I am in school and finally happy. Thank you Xanax... I think."

259,0,"so i was with my friends and we were just chilling at my friends house. we had drunken two bottles of champagne between the 5 of us and just gotten some weed. my friend had a bottle of delsym cough syrup. my whole motto in life is yolo and like fuck it so i took that shit. i drank 550 mg of it. keep in mind i’m 5’6 and at the time was 105 lbs. after this we went and smoked. so i was on three different things. on the way back to the house after smoking i started to come up. i started to disassociate; i remember looking at all my friends and wondering why i can’t remember any memories with them other than completely made up ones. this lowkey freaked me out but we got back inside. next my friend gave me an herbal type of xanax or some shit. i took this downer and within 20 minutes was absolutely fucked. i came up so fast. and oh my god. i was disassociating so bad i thought i was in a tv show and then my friends faces started to morph into the tv characters. then i was watching my friend play gta and began to think i was in the game gta. then i was drawing on an etch a sketch and thought i was in a race car. it was pretty crazy. i also couldn’t stop itching my neck , it was pretty much like i was on heroin. next i started to run around his hallways but everytime i got back to his door i would gasp bc i was pretty sure there was a barrier blocking me. the time warp is worse than weed a minute feels like an hour. i couldn’t feel any pain, i stabbed my self during this, couldn’t feel it. so next thing my friends mom had to drive me home and uh basically i could barely walk. i kept convincing myself we were going back to my friends house but we weren’t and i didn’t know where i was. also i had extreme audio hallucinations the radio music would distort, like speed up slow down and in the background of all the sounds i heard a trap beat. it was very scary tbh. another thing i wasn’t worried ab anything at all i literally let my friend leave my house in the middle of the night to smoke, no worries. everything was spinning and i could really only describe the feel as fuzzy. anyways this lasted until 12 hours to the next day, i recovered fully no nausea. it was pretty fun."
261,0,"So I've mostly been sober for 8 months, but had a slip up. 

I was up for over 24 hours on Adderall, then I decided to grab some Xanax Bars to help with winding down an sleeping. 

Now I knew these were pressed, but I always got them from the same person (before I got sober), an was like whatever. (being a drug addict you don't make good decisions.) 

These were the white 2mg bars, but they had orangish/yellow specs in them. Never seen these before. 

So I decide to take a very tiny piece, it taste extremely bitter (Alprazolam) so I'm like cool, then literally a few seconds later I felt this weird feeling, like a head rush, or something, like when you do too much of something an it's like (Oh fuck I'm gonna fall out.) Or I would almost describe it as coming up on MDMA. 

I don't know it was fucking weird though, after that though nothing negative happened, my breathing was bad, my anxiety was fucking bad though, but I didn't feel high on any kind of substance, didn't feel like fentanyl (I know what that feels like) 

I flushed the rest of the bars, remind you I had been up for over 24 hours, for the first time in a long time, an had been doing Adderall (last dose of this was earlier in the day though, not around the time I dosed the Xanax) 

I looked all around for information on instant acting substances, couldn't find anything. It definitely contained Alprazolam though, I know that distinct taste."

264,0,"So I was planning on making this post earlier in time, but decided to give it time to actually confirm that this had been successful. 

So in early November I bought Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and I had been playing video games quite a lot at the time, but this game in particular was different. I obsessed over getting good at it and played for anywhere from 3-9 hours a day. In some cases this could possibly not be a bad thing, but in my personal case, it was affecting my lifestyle. 

My amount of socialising with friends and family lowered. My aggression increased, I had a more dull outlook on things. 

In late January I took 125μg of LSD at 6pm and spent the afternoon and night at a friends house enjoying myself. 

When I was at my friends he explained to me while I was peaking a simple rundown of how dopamine works, and how your mind essentially makes you feel happy/satisfied when you successfully complete a task you desired to complete. 

When I got home at 1am, naturally being roughly in the middle of my trip I couldn't sleep, so I decided to do some activities.

One of the activities was playing call of duty of course, but my opinion on the game changed quickly. I was putting the concept of dopamine into perspective whilst playing, and realised that I was quite displeased by the idea of feeling good because I was killing someone, regardless if in a video game, for me it was about the concept. 

Haven't played any video games since, and even if you think my opinion on it is stupid or unreasonable I'm happy because I've broken a habit that was negatively impacting my life. 

Also it shouldn't have to be said, but this is not me saying that LSD is going to fix your problems or your gaming addiction, luckily it just did for me. Cheers for reading and have a good one"

Now as I said, I am absolute noob in this field. Is there a drug that's able to help my anxiety temporarily (few hours)? Even if the side effect was that you won't be able to move the next day or that you will be in extreme pain for the next week, I don't fucking care. I just want to go through these events without dying of anxiety.

So I ate around a half an eighth of shrooms across the span of ten minutes last night. In about a half of an hour I saw so many shapes and colors. It was so vibrant and lovely.

I was laying in bed with my boyfriend and was texting my friend and I remember getting scared about the colors coming from my phone screen.           
          
So I blacked out again and then remember picking myself up from the beams in the ceiling of my room in the basement. Then I pissed myself and ran around the basement screaming because my boyfriend was a monster and our cat was the god of this realm, and the cat was hiding dark secrets behind her. I then blacked out again           
            
Then I went on a fairy adventure with my sister (who wasn't there) and time was in bending and we jumped over green pastures in one go, but I'm sure that didn't really happen. Then I ran around my house and ripped things off of the wall and ripped up one of the carpets and pissed myself again. I ripped out all of my piercings (no damage I can tell this morning, they all went back in okay) and started trying to attack my boyfriend because he was a monster and was trying to drown me, but he said this morning that he was just trying to relax me and clean me up from all the urine and redress me because I guess I got naked? Also I didn't really attack him he said, I just pushed him over because I was running around and ran into him and started beating up the walls. 
        
Then I went in our room and threw a glass full of water and laid down again, I think. He made me some coffee and egg salad because I was freaking out and they usually help me if I'm upset. So I started screaming the words to a song I sing if I'm having a panic attack, he said. The line I particularly sings goes ""in, in, out through the mouth/breathing exercises I will never figure out"" and I started hyperventilating. Then he had to hold me down because I started screaming again and wanted to chase the cat and at that point I was in and out of lucidity and I was convinced that everything he was saying was of my own machination and that nothing was real, it was just an illusion. The cat god was trying to trick me.           
          
He started feeding me egg salad and tried to get me to drink a little bit but then I blacked out again. The next thing I remember is waking up half naked smelling like piss while crying into a portable phone charger like it was an actual phone about 13 hours after ingestion. He told me it's okay and everything will be fine, but I still see black holes everywhere and I'm so upset I freaked out so bad. I don't know what happened. I was happy for a little bit and then just snapped. I'm now stuck with horrible diarrhea and fixing my house; nailing the carpet back down, putting things back on walls, doing a lot of laundry because I ruined two blankets and two outfits, mopping up piss, and cleaning up a broken glass.          
        
I'm glad my boyfriend was there for me but I have no clue what happened. Does anyone here have any input? Idk maybe I just needed to tell someone about this terrifying experience."

Happened when I was like 8 so I got used to living with it, I just had a deviated septum. Mine was really bad though, I couldn’t breathe through my right nostril because the septum was blocking it off. Once my girlfriend found out she loved jokingly plugging my left nostril so I had to breathe out of my mouth. She did it to me every day or two for a few months, but I didn’t mind. One day we decide to take some acid, which we do often enough and take 2 tabs of what is claimed to be 200ug tabs. She jokingly plugs my nose a bunch over the course of the night but never in any sort of aggressive way. The next morning though I could breathe clearly out of both sides of my nose, and my septum is back where it should be. My nose wasn’t sore the next morning and I hadn’t made any attempts to put it back into place. It’s been about 4 months since this happened and I can still breathe freely but have no clue how."

289,0,"So I'm ashamed to admit that I fell into the sobriety trap of Xanax, and ended up taking 8mg of it. However, I hardly felt anything. No dizziness, no slurred speech, no blackout, and only very slight dizziness. I have taken into account my benzo tolerance, but never have I gone beyond 3 or 4mg of Xanax. 

My preliminary conclusion is that they sugal pills, or there was far less alprazolam than what was advertised (2mg). I find this hard to believe, as the plug is reputable. 

There are some factors to bear in mind which may assist one of you in helping me to find out what happened:

1) I also took 40mg of Diazepam.  
 2) The consumption of the Xanax was spread throughout the day. With that being said, at least 4-6 of the 8mg eaten between 6pm and 10pm."

292,0,"So I took 18mg of Diazepam around 2:55am last night, around 3:20am I felt it kick in, I've only ever done valium once around 5mg, I fell asleep soon after the effects started kicking in


I can't figure out if I had sleep paralysis or an insanely vivid dream, but I opened my eyes in my room laying in bed, I could feel my heart beating in my chest, my mattress slowly started to rise higher and higher, and while I was still attached to it it flipped vertical and my mattress floated towards my window and then suddenly flung back to my bed frame with me in it, the whole time I was floating I was like ""wtf is going on"" but I didn't really say anything either because I couldn't or because I just didn't, It's hard to remember


But I'm so confused as to if this was sleep paralysis or not, I went on that night to have an extremely extremely vivid dream, as I lived through a whole relationship, I went downstairs really late at night in this dream and someone ran out of a room with a blanket covering something

I shouted for the people in my house that there's someone in here and then they proceed to come down after this guy had fled, we go into the living room (or lounge) and there was 3 people sat there, one with a gun telling us that there's nothing we could do and that we better sit down as they have a gun, they proceeded to rob shit

This was extremely extremely vivid it felt as if it was actually happening and when I woke up it stopped but I fell back asleep straight away and it was almost like a week had passed in this dream, our house was missing objects like our TV and other expensive items, and then I finally woke up, this has to be the most weird experience I've ever had sleeping and I still can't figure out if I had sleep paralysis at the start, it all felt so fucking vivid it was insane, can anyone make sense of any of this?"

296,0,"I just got off the phone with him a little while ago, and got to hear more of his side of this. 

Backstory: we used to live on Kauai, but moved to Molokai in 2008, when I turned 6 and started 1st grade. My dad was flying back and forth working as a carpenter on Kauai, and came home to Molokai on the weekends. Eventually he just quit flying out so he could stay home over here. He got a job hauling freight for our neighborhood convenience store twice a week in fall 2009, and worked at a few carpentry jobs here (though a lot less compared to when he was on Kauai).

He said that when his company on Kauai was slowing down cause of the post-2008 economy, and was staying home on Molokai only working at the store twice a week, my mom told him more better he grow pakalolo, and he said the last time he did, he got busted, so if he ever gonna do it again, it's a one time deal. Sometime in spring 2011, he started growing pakalolo, and he had about 800 plants growing in the bushes, in the kiawe forest behind our yard, but my mom never know about it. Then she seen it through the binoculars one day, and she was like ""what is this?"", and really went off on him, like somebody was gonna call the cops."

298,0,"Hi guys. Basically developed a small dependence on codeine. Started off with serious tooth pain so I was prescribed 30/500 and then took them for around 3 months daily at 30-60mg a dose twice a day ish. I also take 100mg of pregabalin twice a day for neuropathic pain and this of course potentiates the codeine. I have now been taking codeine like this for 4 and a half months now. 

Anyway I am waking up at night feeling dope sick and have realised codeine absolves that feeling so I have cut down to about 12.4mg pill twice maybe three times a day. Will move down to 8mg pills soon I think...

I was wondering if you had any pointers or tips to do with tapering? Is it worth just going cold turkey at this point and sucking it up? Access to generic brand Nurofen Plus and 8/500 is very easy.

300,0,"I know that in the last months and years a lot of people turned their opinion towards legalizing Cannabis. However the collective knowledge about drugs or psychoactive substances seems to end here.

Many don't know about the fact, that there are even more harmless, yet illegal substances. Take for example LSD, Psylocibin, DMT or Iboga. No reported deaths, basically no risk of getting addicted, so quiet harmless compared to alcohol. Alkohol in generall is absolutly not less dangerous than Kokain or MDMA.

And why exactly are some psychoactive substances illegal? I don't harm others and if i want to take Heroin, Meth or alcohol until i die, I should have every right to do so. I can also eat myself to death with fast food (what a lot of Americans seem to do).

Many fear that the number of drug abusers and drug related deaths will rise when certain drugs are legal. This however is not the case in Portugal, which has decriminalised all drugs and therefore reduced HIV infections and drug related deaths. Just ask yourself if you would do Heroin if it was legal. I don't think so and neither would I. 

Also the war on drugs continues to claim victimes especially in the USA, Latin America and the Philipines (buzzword: human rights abuses). Other than that it is a huge waste of money and extremely ineffective.

Some years ago I was also horrified of the idea to legalize drugs, because i didn't know better and ""drugs"" was a synonyme for ""Heroin"" at the time. As I got more knowledge about the topic, the drug prohibition made less and less sense. This is true for most people: the more you know about drugs , the more you will support legalization. People with no real knowledge about the topic oppose this idea (likely out of fear of the unknown)."

303,0,"When I was around 15, I usually took bus straight from my school down to my friends house and it took about 1.5 hours to get there, just to smoke weed sometimes. Once though, we got really fucking stoned, like insanely high because we got to try dabs for the first time, all went well until I left and went to the bus station. It was around 7pm at that time but it was a suburb in Australia so there weren't many people around. I waited there for the bus and when I saw the bus with couple of people in it coming my way , and I got super paranoid (still in school uniform and if they even get a hint that im high, they will call my school cause it was one of those strict private schools) and put on some really loud music and walked onto the bus. But now here was the problem.

I had already bought an all day pass early on when going down there so I rushed into the bus but forgot to show the driver the ticket and went to the very back listening to music. The bus just stood there for 5 solid minutes because the driver was shouting but I didn't hear anything and the driver didn't get out of his seat and I thought everything was fine, probably running ahead of schedule or something. I got to the bus interchange to board the second bus towards my home and when I got out and started walking on the road the driver sped up and pulled the bus in front of me, he said something on the terms of, ""where is your ticket "" and something about calling the cops and I quickly took out my ticket that I purchased earlier while my heart was pounding like 1000bpm about to pass out and then he checked it and let me go. I was laughing my arse off for the next 10 minutes while he was just waiting for his next shift.

I had never felt so embarrassed in my entire life and I am sorry to the driver the the couple of passengers in the bus.

I low key killt Sean’s trip with my high maintenance ass. It was warranted though because at this point my life I wanted to lull myself. I had planned a peaceful suicide. I think my depression had been heavily weighing on me for quite a while, I felt it was a good time to go. These thoughts scared so much but I’m glad for them in the end because I feel they’ve struck a fire beneath me. I can’t remember a time when I’ve been so motivated to create and be productive. All of this bubbled up emotion had come to a point where it had to be relieved, on a night early in my senior year (class of 2020) I decided to git fucked up with some friends and go see Ford vs. Ferrari (spoiler alert: we literally paid and everything and never saw the movie). On this night I had an abzolute meltdown, I completely tripped out and basically told my core friend group at the time my plans to kill myself. My plan was to take a decent amount of Xanax and later drink a sizeable amount of alchohocl all with the $uicideBoy$ song “Long Gone” (save me from this hell) playing in the background (put on repeat). We all cried I think, but this moment will forever be cemented in my legacy as a defining moment. I am so very proud of myself for doing this (even if I was trippin) because if I never did this I don’t think my beautiful art would be here or my eye catching personality. it all could’ve gone to waste if I decided to end it. Now I don’t want to say acid is the cure all for mental health, it would be to good to be true.

315,0,"For starters, I am currently on a hefty dose of xan. Before I disclose  how much, please notice I’m typing normally, so I don’t believe this is one of those “thinking it isn’t working” scenarios.

So, I didn’t exactly measure, but I have taken roughly 9-10 mg of xan over the past 4 hours. Does that strike you as crazy?

My doc is always shocked by the way my body metabolizes all meds (E.g. I take 40mg lexapro per day when highest dose typically prescribed is 20– and effects have been minimal. I’m prescribed 60mg vyvance, 30mgXR addy, and I take 450mg Wellbutrin today). So, say what you’d like about my psychiatrist based on that brief summary, but I’m a big dude (not sure if that factors) who has required high doses for everything to feel effects. 

For the record, I don’t generally abuse these drugs. Well, obviously you could say I abused the xans tonight, but I just want to feel what the xan effects are like. I’ve yet to notice anything. As an important note: i only take them on average 1 time a week so it’s not something becoming an addiction or tolerance increase. . 

So what I’m getting at here is: is my current dose too much, period? Or is this a metabolism explanation? OR am I xanned our and have no idea, but somehow can still walk balanced, think clearly, type clearly, etc. I’m not worried right now— this isn’t one of those posts— more so a post inquiring whether I can pop another bar. Probably will anyway but by the time I read any potential fear mongering comments I think I’ll be nice and chill. 

Your takes?

PS, one last question: what is the general reason for upping Xanax doses? Are the effects increased in some way as well? And in what way?

I’m prescribed the Gabapentin, 300mg 3x a day. So I took 3000mg of Gabapentin, not spread out every 30 min bc it was already late where I am and didn’t have time for it. Even though I didn’t spread it out, it hit me like the loving sun on a cool summer evening.

 I took the pills and then hit the slopes. The gaba feels like it took all the negative aspects of coke away and enhanced the good qualities of this snow. I don’t feel paranoia or anxiety and am very comfortable inside my quarantined condo looking over the Short North and it’s glowing lights. 

The GABA also adds a trippy effect to my surprise, feels like a barely threshold dose of LSD or Mushrooms. The covers on my bed expand and move, they are breathing in a slow way much like a dose of Psilocybin. 

I don’t have a psychedelic state of mind with this combo just an enhanced cocaine High with relaxation and some visuals. :)

327,0,"I took Modafinil for the first time today and really enjoyed it while working. I’m a daily cannabis user and have a sky high tolerance. It’s to the point where I can take 10 rips from a bong after a 24 hour break and still feel nothing but a slight buzz for 45 minutes. 

I took the Modafinil around 8 AM and clocked out of work at 3:00. I got out my Dynavap, only expected a very mediocre high like I have been getting the past 9 months of literal every night use. Especially since I was vaping and not using oils or a bong, which I have a strong tolerance to.

For some reason, I was high as a kite. Higher than I was able to get since I first started smoking. It felt almost like an Acid trip. My apartment looked so unfamiliar, I had no idea where I was. My thoughts were so loud and rampant. I had to keep reminding myself I was in my apartment and not in someone else’s home. It was one of the weirdest, strongest experiences I’ve had.

334,0,"First off, I’m a 20 year old male and I have been experimenting with substances. I have tried LSD around 6-7 times (most was 350ug), MDMA once (.150mg), Shrooms 4 times (most was 5 grams but felt weaker than I expected), and smoked weed daily for a few years, but currently on a break. I have suffered with depression and anxiety in the past, but had only had a mildly bad trip on a high dose of LSD once. This was my first time trying this substance and it was the craziest and most life changing moment of my life. It was inside a treat and contained 50mg. I looked up the dosage and thought it’d be similar to the heroic dose of shrooms I took, but it was much more intense than the shrooms I had before.

I was recommended to take half, but I was extremely ignorant and took the whole thing. I took it around 9pm and went to take a shower before it kicked in. I was in the shower for about 15 minutes and went into my room and started to notice a little movement on some art in my room. I sat down and started to watch Kill Bill and had my computer on as well with some trippy and relaxing animation. I had the movie on because I thought it’d be cool to see a Tarantino movie on it. I had the sound low, lights off and had my headphones in listening to music. 

Roughly 30 minutes start to come by and I realize the body high slowly start to creep in. I am watching the fight scene of Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox and everything starts to warp and look weird. I also start to become very attracted to both actresses. I continue to watch and everything slowly starts to hit me VERY hard. Music starts sounding like too much. TV and computer start to bug me. Heart starts beating fast and I start to mildly panic because I didn’t expect it to feel like this and hit this hard.

It gets to about the 45 minute mark and I can’t take it anymore. I turn everything off and grab like 4 waters from the fridge. I start to drink it and it feels so good, but strange at the same time. It ends up getting too much. I lay down on my bed and cover myself with my blankets, turn on my fan, turn on a sleeping playlist. Everything was so crazy and I felt very tired so I though that I’d possibly be able to sleep so I close my eyes and try. After this, I pretty much lost track of time. 

I get INSANE closed eye visuals that looked like glow in the dark figures and other colorful entities. None of them talked to me, just looked at me and I tried to ignore them and push it away. They eventually left, but I was still having insane patterns and stuff that blows any of my other experiences out of the water. I’m still pretty terrified but don’t feel totally there enough to worry too much. 

Then the thoughts kick in. I think about all the substances I’ve bought and tried. My brain immediately starts to panic and think that the law is going to come for me and arrest me because of all of the substances I have in my home. I get up and flush my small stash with no regret. I then start to grab my old shitty burner pc and put it in the dumpster. 

I eventually get it back out and think a person might be outside because I don’t have my glasses on and I have shitty eyesight but no one answered when I said hello. I just continue to worry that someone’s coming because of ordering substances and hoping I don’t wake up my brother in the other room. I think about my future and how I don’t want to end up in prison and that I’m really jeopardizing my future just for drugs. This is when I really start to break down and cry A LOT. I think about my family and friends that I wouldn’t be able to see if I was locked up and my friend who is currently in prison. I also start to think how awful jail is because I was arrested for having a quarter on me right after I turned 18, 2 years ago. 

This is when I get on my phone and start to type things in my web browser because I thought they tapped my phone and could see whatever I typed. I remember typing, call me if you can talk, I hope my bad decisions don’t ruin my future, I’m done with all of this, I hope I don’t let my family down, and a bunch of other shit.  I also worry about legal fees and don’t want it to bankrupt my parents because I’m a broke 20 year old. This also stemmed from the guilt of having them pay for my $2,000 bail for possession of marijuana charges when I was 18 along with legal fees. 

I continue to panic for a while, but eventually it turned into love. I started to realize how much I love my life and freedom and how I shouldn’t take it for granted. I realize how much my mother means to me, how much she’s done for me, and I can never disappoint her like that. I am still panicking quite a bit, but I eventually accept that if they ever arrest me or came to my house that it’d happen regardless if I worry about it or not. I also calm myself down because I have nothing in my possession anymore. 

I eventually calmed down over time. I realized that things in life can be really scary and shitty, but there’s always a silver lining somewhere if you look hard enough. I realized how much my freedom and peace of mind mean to me and I realized how much my I love my family and friends. I even ended up forgetting why I was so damn worried because I was very safe and took a lot precautions when obtaining substances, but it still taught me enough that I wasn’t interested in ANY risk that jeopardized my freedom. One of the main things I was grateful for was that it helped me realize how small some of my problems in my life were. Specifically, my alcoholic and toxic ex who cheated on me a year ago that I haven’t talked to since, but have struggled to get over. I feel very over it and at peace that it’s over and that I have bigger problems to worry about. 

I am done with any psychedelic substances for the foreseeable future and have learned a lot. Although this was the most terrifying and insane experience of my life, I do not regret this experience. It taught me a ton and gave me serious life lessons. I am very thankful I went through this. I urge everyone to be safe with their use and take your substance use seriously. I appreciate anyone who reads this and I hope my experience can help others. I feel fine now and I look forward to my life currently and the future. 

Thanks if you read all of this and I hope it taught someone something or maybe had a good laugh about it. Hope you enjoyed. 

TL;DR: Underestimated the power of 4-AcO-DMT, hit way too fast and hard, thought I was going to be arrested, got rid of all substances I had, think my phone is tapped / tracked, panic turns into thinking about future and how thankful I am for my mother and family in general, learn how much my freedom and peace of mind mean to me, got over my ex and learned how little my past problems have been and how much more life I have to live."

344,0,"I have  a friend and she was always the popular girl in high school, super full of herself and how she looks, and when we met and become close friends, and I noticed that she is so much more genuine and wonderful than what she puts out.

It’s hard to be a person and she has a really big ego that can make her seem really shallow and look down on other people and she puts up a lot of walls with her emotions and she can seem super judge mental but I KNOW that deep down she doesn’t mean it and it’s just social constructs that make her think she has to be that way. 

She has made me feel a lot better about myself, and I’ve learned a lot from her and she’s learned a lot from me. Every time she trips she does it with toxic weird people and if you are familiar with tripping, you know how nights like those go. 

I’m gonna trip with her this week and I really wanna set up a good experience to where she can have her own self realizations and be able to feel comfortable and love her authentic self. I feel like if she did, she wouldn’t feel the need to have to follow the sheep in order to fit in.

I’m not in any way trying to force a trip to be a certain way or change who she is, I just really wanna make a set up where she has the space to have a nice experience. 

I’m pretty familiar with setting up nice settings for trips but I was wondering if anyone had any tips I can use to maybe enhance the experience. 

Thanks for reading let me know if you think of anything! (And FYI I’m a female too just for reference to the set up)"

355,0,"So I'm hella blazed right now and i got into the entire thought process about harder things than weed.

And  i realized that most hard drugs besides the ones that rewrite your  bodies chemistry to the  point where you PHYSICALLY need it, are like a  devils deal.

When  you make a deal  with the devil, you get amazing shit and what you want  but then it all  gets taken away and you experience the opposite of it.  There's always a  catch, you need to be ready to go through the pain  afterwards as a  payment for the good, right?

You  want to feel confident  for a bit? Well here you go! Take some coke! but  Happiness doesn't exist without pain so  you have to experience both to  have balance.

So have amazing euphoria, but feel like shit for a few days as payment for the good feeling!

So  there are drugs that can be used responsibly and do no harm to one but  harm to other, i  guess what matters the most is if the person is ready  to go through the  negative part after experiencing the positive

And so many people become addicts  because they don't want to face the negative side, while its only there to balance it out

they want to keep as much of the good as possible

just like they do irl with others things (Avoiding pain)"

It feel as if I’m wasting my life away on video games and Netflix, while trying to focus on anything else for more than 10 minutes feels impossible.

364,0,"My girlfriend (about to turn 16) asked me about taking acid, if I’ve ever done it. This was something I was planning to keep to myself, however I knew where the conversation was going so I said yes. She knew I’ve dabbled with drugs before, but never acid. For context, I had a bout with drugs (weed, dxm, alc) around a year ago that ended with a good acid trip (100ug), but also with a few months of agonizing derealization. I’m recovered, sober and plan on being sober until college.

She said she was planning on trying it with her friends around the time she turns 16 in a few months. I nearly broke down, because I knew this was practically my fault. I’m the one that talked to her about drugs in the first place, and that’s all I had to do. She has the “I have to find out for myself” attitude now.

Anyways, I proceeded with a serious demeanor as I began to tear up, because I don’t want her to go through the same thing I did. She also said she didn’t want me to tripsit her, which made no sense. She finally agreed to wait until college when we can do it together and “safely.”

My question is: was that the right move? I really do want her to try it, however I want it to be with me, preferably when she’s not 15/16. Also, I guarantee she won’t test whatever tab she ends up with, which is something that wouldn’t be a problem if we were in college. 

Am I a dick for that? I’m really just trying to save her potential mental turmoil. She had no grasp of how serious a first psychedelic experience is. Thank y’all ❤️"

384,0,"So had a very harrowing experience last night... background info about me I have smoked weed for about a year every day, I’ve been vaping since my sophomore year of high school (senior) and just recently started smoking cigarettes (currently tryna kick that aside). Only other drug I have done is LSD once. Only a couple times have I almost felt like I was going to green out but I have never actually greened out.. but this.. was NOT greening out. 

Story time: I had casually just packed three bowls of bud and smoked out of my old OG marley pipe while I was walking my dog in the backyard. Nothing out of the usual. I get back in and was high but again nothing out of the ordinary. I sit down at the dinner table with my family and little brother and my family members also smoke. Everything was fine and then as I’m finishing I start to lose my sight and hearing so I excuse myself from the table and at this point like I can feel my body just does not seem right. I put my plate away and walk to my room trying to play it off but then everything goes black and fuzzy and I don’t even make it there... I collapse against my kitchen wall nearly breaking my neck and my whole family runs up and rushes me to my room carrying me. My mom is trying to get me to respond as she notices there’s no color in my face my pupils are so dilated that you can’t see any color in my eyes my face is droopy my body is limp arms hanging out and I’m falling in and out of consciousness forwards and backwards. They remove my clothes as I’m still nodding off, all terrified. That’s only goes on for about 5-10 more minutes. All I can remember is I felt very hot and sweaty and elevated. and then I sat on the couch and I was absolutely fine no more than 15 minutes later. Scary as fuck and traumatizing. (Also, have ptsd from falling into the wall and my head cracking it.. last thing I was fully conscious for) 

Fast forward to this morning there’s no obvious signs of the weed being laced so I get drug tested to be sure and nothing comes back positive besides THC... I have never taken pills or shot up or done anything else besides what I said above so this makes no sense and I want to get to the bottom of this because it’s not normal to “nod off” weed. I know what greening out is I’ve witnessed it and it’s almost happened to me and I will tell you it is nothing like what happened... so any comments about me being lightweight, can’t hang, i was just too high... u get reported. Plain and simple. My mother who went to medical school and has literally seen and revived people from heroin overdoses thought it was methadone... some answers needed."

My university is in a rural wooded area, there’s a handful of communities nearby, but immediately around campus is woods and hiking trails. The best part is, my school bought a lot of that land during a boom in attendance for a few consecutive years in the 60s, but we never sustained the growth, so it’s empty woods that are unsupervised by any sort of authority (campus police is allowed there but I have never seen or heard any evidence of that being a thing). 

Naturally the hippies of our liberal leaning university took to the woods in search of nature, and to get two birds stoned they’d bring weed while they were at it. Get high, see beautiful cliffs, trails, animals, streams, cascades, and you’re away from all trouble and peering eyes! It was perfect!

Somehow the vibe of the woods has gone largely unchanged, even into my current attendance. I don’t know when it started, at least since the late 2000s- but I imagine much longer than that- students will bring tables, chairs, couches, and even a pallets/bamboo-pole combo to make walls (that way you could bring a tarp when raining, and wind won’t blow out your Js, also some parts of the woods are visible from campus if you’re having a campfire at night, so it blocks the light). 

The vibe of the woods... the decorated and painted trees, chairs walls and tables; spots chosen by best view of the valley, a stream, the stars; and the knowledge that *anyone* you see is a friend there to toke alongside you... it’s nothing short of an incredible place (my favorite on earth maybe, but idk if I would have said that before I started typing and missing everything (goddamn corona fomo)). 

Early in my second year of university was my first day in the woods (I had know of them, but not how to get in or navigate them in year one). My friend, Garrett, invited me to go for a smoke after our calculus class together. Garrett made friends with handfuls of dealers and knew the woods after first year. We weren’t good friends then, but we got closer over that summer by snapping and staying in touch digitally. He was excited to show me around the woods and shoot the shit without a screen finally, (and I’ve excitedly shown my good friends since then too, it just kinda spreads lol). 

Right after we got into the woods, Garrett gave me a heads up that “if you see some adult guy, or some dogs, don’t worry about it that’s Dave and his dogs.” I asked what he was doing out in the woods, expecting it to be a ranger or something, but Garrett reassured me that “His property is just on a bit of the woods. He loves to walk his dogs out here since it’s so nice, but really he’s chill. If he comes by we’ll offer him a hit and chat.” I wasn’t fully eased, but figured it was a weekday afternoon, so we’d likely be lonely. 

Nope. We set up at one of the first “forts” as we call them (numbers are ordered in the order you get to them on the trail, but forks make this confusing af honestly), and before we had started the first session of my vaporizer or lit Garrett’s joint we heard a clinking of collars. 

I instinctively put my things in my pocket but didn’t try to hide. I just waved to who I assumed to be Dave, and started petting the dogs who had bolted ahead at the sign of company. 

Garrett called out a greeting, to Dave, but only after greeting the dogs, of course. Once Dave had gotten to us, I recognized him as a graying, but still fit groundskeeper from campus. We introduced each other and got talking about dogs, state of the school, how good the weed we were passing was, he had even worked construction before and some of my family was at the time, it was good fun. 

Stayed much longer than I meant to since we got caught up talking, so I showed up to econ that evening a tad high lol. 

After that visits to the woods were common if not daily (not always to smoke, good for reading, jogs, mountain biking, plus any other drugs you’d like to bring too lol). I ran into and and chatted with Dave scores of times since then. He did his dog walk at the same time each day week to week, so if I didn’t naturally run into Dave some week, I would make an effort to stay out for that dog walk window on that Friday. 

Haven’t seen Dave since the beginning of winter now though because of coronavirus, (plus it can get too cold to be out there). Good to know that it can be that easy to spark up (hehe) a friendship, even with a few decades of an age gap. 





*TLDR*

*My school has unsupervised woods around a rural campus. So students make forts and get high, have a campfire, or trip balls out in the woods free of paranoia and judge mental eyes. Part of the woods are owned by an employee of the school, and students will talk with him, pet his dogs, and smoke him up. Just another case of the stoner community making unlikely friends of us.*"
391,0,"So since last year, I've finally been able to try out different drugs without the risk of family members catching me. I started out with shrooms cause it was what I wanted to try most (Aside from DMT). I took 2mg the first time around since I'd never done any drugs before, but they had no effect on me. I doubled the dose about a month later and felt the comeup, but didn't actually get any of the trip. I know that they were a good batch cause I took them with my mate who was tripping.

Skip forward to about a week ago, I get my hands on some MDMA. Really good shit, felt the effects no problem.That got me thinking that maybe I just have a higher tolerance when it comes to organic stuff, so I wanna try synthetic hallucinogens, but I know close to nothing about them.

I'm pretty familiar with LSD, but from what I've heard, it doesn't have anywhere near the same effect as shrooms and stuff, plus it's harder to find. The only other synthetic hallucinogen I know of is DXM, which I didn't even know the name of until last week. From the sound of it, it's not really meant to be an hallucinogen in the first place and the side effects seem like a pain in the ass to deal with. 

Thus I'm here asking for assistance from people who probably know way more on the topic than I."
392,0,"Guys you're not going to believe this but I just went through the most amazing acid trip of my life.

My friends and I have been doing a lot of acid recently and started to experiment with different ways to enhance the experience. We started with the usual suspects such as shrooms and molly, but again, we got bored of this and wanted to see if there was anything that could further enhance the experience. So we tried weed (okay idea), coke (bad idea), K (bad idea), salvia (so so idea), and finally... NOS amazing idea. The first time we tried NOS we did the conventional method. Fill a balloon up with a few canisters of NOS and hyperventilate mid trip. This was great but again we wanted to take things a step further as this started to get boring as well. We wondered if we were to boof the NOS instead of hyperventilating... would that take the experience to a new level? We'd heard that alcohol up the ass would fuck you up so why not try nangs? We joked about this idea for awhile but about a month ago I said fuck it I'm going to try it by myself. If nothing happened I'd just keep the incident between me and Jesus but if it was a success I was going to tell other people. So... here we go:

The first thing I decided was how was i going to get the NOS up my ass? Straight from the whip cream dispenser seemed like an easy idea but potentially painful. So I filled up a balloon first and then got a metal straw and some lube. I made a connection between my ass and the balloon using the straw as the middle man. I slowly started to release the NOS from the balloon and could feel the cold air fill my ass. A little weird at first, but within 2-3 minutes I was in heaven. I couldn't believe the experience. It felt like I was on 5 tabs of acid instead of 1 and I went to a different dimension. On a planet that is literally filled with happiness and this is the only possible way to get there.

You think I would have stopped there but I had to take it one step further. I introduced the idea to my friends and slowly one by one they each tried it and agreed with me that this was the best method of enhancing the acid experience. So.... this past weekend we decided we wanted to try boofing nangs and hyperventilating NOS at the same time. HOLY FUCKING TITS LADS. WE MADE IT. NIRVANA DOES EXIST. ACID ALONE CAN NEVER TAKE YOU TO THIS LEVEL.  WE LITERALLY CANT PUT THIS EXPERIENCE INTO WORDS.  THE COMBINATION OF EUPHORIA AND VISUALS IS SOOOOO AMAZING!!!!!! I know it sounds fucking crazy but this odd journey was the best decision of my life.  I know I sound fucked but trust me when I say this is the ultimate acid experience and everyone should try it.

P.S. make sure you've taken a shit before doing this ;)"

Background:

I personally don't think I'm an addict, and my friends don't either. Maybe I am, it's hard to judge your own use. What I do know is I find myself drunk or high on whatever more often than I would like, and quarantine isn't helping.  

I'm currently 19 and a 2nd semester senior in high school, but I take all college courses at a local university. I've used drugs semi-regularly for about a year or so. It's usually alcohol, weed, MDMA (with strict 3-month rule), psychedelics, ketamine, or Adderall (trying to eliminate Adderall entirely). 

In the past, I used pretty sparingly; however, I currently find myself to be drunk or high more often than I would like. I'm afraid I'm heading down a path of poly-substance addiction. I'm pretty confident I'm not there yet, but I could be heading towards there. My parents have started giving me alcohol at dinner almost daily to ""prep me for college"" and due to quarantine, and it hasn't been helping me.

I definitely don't want to completely eliminate my drug including alcohol use at all, but I do want to reduce it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

My question is: how can I reduce my drug use to avoid a poly-substance addiction/dependence, especially during these times? I'm not trying to become completely sober, nor do I think I'm an addict yet, but I want to be more responsible. What do y'all recommend doing?

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr: Tips on reducing (but not completely eliminating) drug including alcohol use?**"
411,0,"I feel almost embarrassed talking about this but I cant explain the thoughts and feelings I experience on a daily basis.

To start off I am sophomore in high school and have come to realize I might have a serious drug problem, it's not that i'm doing crazy drugs left and right but I have had experiences while on some drugs that changed my perspective of life, for the worse I fear.

It all began when I started smoking weed about a year ago(of course). While I always intended on sticking to weed all my friends were experimenting with other drugs and you can guess where that went. It started off with pills and some minor drugs which snowballed into what really changed me, the psychedelics.

There was a night that has forever made me fearful of my own thoughts and capabilities. Some friends and I had gotten some really good shrooms from a guy who really knew his shit. These shrooms were like no others I've tried, intense visuals and amazing euphoric feelings, on this particular night we had about nine grams and I decided I wanted to have a crazy experience with psychedelics I probably took a little less than an eighth and smoked some weed, about twenty minutes later I realized my mistake. I remember almost everything from that night and know I will never forget it.

The rest of the night played out into me having dark thoughts that were out of the blue for me. I had a serious panic attack and by the end of the night had serious thoughts of suicide which I am glad now faded, but never in my life have I felt these emotions and intense thoughts about myself. I specifically remember thinking that I was bored of life, that I had no more to do except drugs.

This experience made me realize I may have a drug problem, I had a talk with myself and came to the conclusion that the drugs were an escape from my own problems and my own life, I feel safe while on drugs.

Ever since this night my life has not felt the same, it is almost like this experience made me into a prisoner of my own thoughts and mind, like it triggered something in me that made me feel different almost constantly, except when I'm on drugs.

I want to know where I can find help, to know if this experience changed me for good or if it is something I can slowly work on and fix.

This is something I have never told another soul, what do I do?"

I’m definitely more giggly than calm but I’m wondering if that’s because of the anti anxiety medication, and why? Will the giggles go away?

423,0,"The other day my GF and I got really high and had sex, and it was the most fucking incredible sexual experience I've ever had. In the past I've always really enjoyed jerking off while high. I've also had sex while high once in a past relationship, but it wasn't particularly memorable. 

This time though... holy shit it basically blew every past sexual experience I've had out of the water. My sense of touch felt like it was magnified 100x so even the smallest touch from my GF would get me hard as fuck. When I touched her body I literally felt like there was electricity coming from my fingertips, that's how intense it was. Plus whenever she touched my dick the physical sensation felt like I was about to cum, except I would just get more and more turned on without finishing. Every second it felt like I had already reached the ""peak"" where I feel like I can't get any more turned on and am about to cum, but we'd just keep going and things would get better and better. 

I also felt way more emotionally connected during sex. In the past I've always hesitated with getting high with a girl because weed makes me feel anxious and vulnerable. But this time when we were pressed against each other in bed I just felt 100% safe and able to let loose. 

In the end I came 4 times and it felt like I was orgasming for ages! I was seeing stars the entire time and my body felt super numb. Even hours after we finished having sex, my body still tingled. 

10/10 would do again. Has anyone else had similar experiences with weed/sex? Are there any other drugs you'd recommend to have sex on?"

Then I just remove my screen and lean out my window and toke up. Then I wait like 5 mins with the window open, then spray a little bit of air freshener, and I’m good. 

It’s not like my mom doesn’t care, she will rip my fucking ass when she catches me, it’s happened before(not in this scenario)

I turned around because of it so I guess I acted on my delusions.

This was the fourth time I had a freak out episode, the first time was on LSD, the other two were on simple weed, and the last time was on DXM second or low Third plateau.

It doesn’t happen every time I get high though, but i did only do acid twice and the delusion happened last time I tripped. Like I said only a handful since September 2019

444,0,"So this happened back around 2014 or so when I was 14 and my good friend was a few months younger. I had gotten back into smoking from a friend I knew at school so I’d go to hang out with him at his apartment complex, we’d pick up some bud and get high. 


This day my friend wasn’t around so I hit up another mutual friend who lived their from school, he said he was down to smoke so I got a ride over with my neighbor who is the one that passed out. We get to the apartments and grab the bud, we roll up two blunts like usual and went outside to smoke. We make it through about half the blunt when my neighbor looks at me with this creepy smile, he just dropped to the ground out of nowhere hitting his head and still smiling the whole time. 



My mutual friends, who in all fairness were some more gangster African American gents saw this and started laughing hysterically and saying wtf. I told them to grab him some water and my neighbor was awake again within 30 seconds. Eventually I look at my phone and see he snapchatted me he wanted to go for a walk and get some air, which was before he passed out. I’m guessing he was high as hell and didn’t want to be disrespectful by wanting to leave as soon as we started smoking, so he wanted me to do it lol. 



When he gets up me and him go for a walk and I asked him what he thought happened, he said he had been drinking all weekend and hadn’t really ate so it could have been his blood pressure. 

Still one of the weirdest smoke seshs I’ve ever had."

459,0,"Okay so In a few months, after the lockdown has stopped (I’m in England btw) because of the virus, I’m thinking of buying some weed. I have very strict parents who don’t allow me to go out with friends or anything. So I’m going to have to do it at home. This is my first time smoking so I’m wondering if this is a good plan to not get caught 

In a few months:
Friday night: I’m going to go to the toilet, open the window to let some air in to cover the smell and on the shower. My parents will think I’m in the shower, whilst I’m smoking. After I’ve smoked, I will brush my teeth, use mouthwash, deodorant and change my clothes. I will also drink a lot of water and use mints.

I have a few questions: 

How should I dispose the zoot? I’m thinking flush it down the toilet (it might block the toilet) or throw it out the window (my parent might find it outside)

Where to put my clothes? I’ve heard that the smell stays on the clothes more so than the body. I might put it in the washing machine straight away. Any other ideas?

Also, any ideas on hiding it? I can either hide it at the back of my wardrobe or on the floor between my bed and the wall but this could be risky because of the smell. I could hide it behind the sofa in the visitors room which it’s unlikely anyone’s going to check or (this is a weird idea) I could store it in a plastic bag in the water tank of the toilet but this is risky as it’s connected to my parents room and the smell. Maybe I could hide it in the garden which no one goes in. I’m open to suggestions because I’m clearly a noob at this. 

As this is my first time smoking, how long does it take to kick in? How many “puffs” should I take? How long does the high last?

Will my eyes go red?

After I smoke, I’ll go bed and listen to some music as it will be night, how’s the experience the following morning?

Any other precautions I should take?

What else do I need to know about buying weed, how much? I’m thinking of getting pre rolled zoots as its easier to set up. 

All other info and help is appreciated 

Like I said, unfortunately I’ll have to smoke at home due to strict parents meaning I’ll be with my family.

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post and if you’ve already heard these questions a million times. I’m clearly uneducated and inexperienced at this. Thanks for reading!"

Within about a half hour, I was on a google doc and the page was a light blue color, so I was staring at this blue light for a while which couldn’t have been good because of how late it was. And after looking at it for a minute, this horrible sensation started to enter me.  I felt completely on edge, to the point i felt like I was gonna explode. Like a really fearful feeling, but it wasn't about anything in particular. My heart was beating really fast and i just really felt like I was about to die. 

I then realized these were all side effects of norepinephrine! I noticed some similarities in the feelings i have had with MDMA. I felt less anxious when was dancing or moving/readjusting my body. I felt like a lot of my cannabis panic attacks have felt this way, just like aimless fear and disorientation, which I now think is definitely norepinephrine.

About two weeks ago I took some LSD and had a possible norepinephrine panic attack just like this one while I was on the very back end of my trip, except it felt like it lasted for much longer.

488,0,"So - to preface this: I do have (confirmed, and a rather bad case of) ADHD, as well as (not as confirmed, a more recent diagnosis) Panic Disorder.  


I have a prescription for adderall (as a generic though, no way am I paying those shit premiums for the same molecules) - and gabapentin (This is known as neurontin) offlabel for stress. Now, this may feel completely normal for you guys - maybe it's my ADHD/PD but we will see.  


A low dose of adderall (2.5mg) paired with gabapentin (300mg) and caffeine ( as needed ) is probably one of the best, most euphoric and happy-go lucky, feelings I have had in a long time. It is almost the ""Nothing bothers me"" level of opioids.   


Anyone else have experience with this?"
489,0,"**Of course this shit is very deadly, Be very careful if you choose to risk your life by mixing these substances**

I took 350MG of dihydrocodeine (I have a very high tolerance from abusing this daily for months), as the high was wearing off I started slowly sipping on some wine. 

After finishing half a cup of wine (no tolerance to alcohol and like 105 pounds), my entire body was full of warmth and I just snuggled into a blanket and waited till the high wore off before I went to sleep.
 
At some points I could barely keep my eyes open and could have easily overdosed as I didn't care how fucked up I was because I felt so great. I DO NOT recommend this combo as it's extremely dangerous and not worth your life."

491,0,"A friend gave a marijuana brownie, he said it was pretty mild but still I just ate half of it. I have smoked in the past but just a little but, just for the ""buzz"". 

The effects started kicking around 45 minutes later, just felt some relaxing sensation... But15 minutes later... Oh.. My... God.

I had never in my life have a panick attack but oh God, oh now I understand the people that has gone through this, it's the worst feeling I've ever felt in my life, I was scared as hell of 2 things:

1. My body just suddenly collapsing because of a heart attack or my brain just exploding
2. Losing control of my own body and start trying to kill myself.

All that I could think of while this was happening was: ""Oh, so this is what people that kill themselves go through on a daily basis"" 

I tried to breathe but didn't work, tried to calm myself but nothing worked, I had to stand up and start walkikg around my room, that calmed me a really bit but the effect lasted for around 2 hours, and when you are high time passes extremely slow, so it felt like an eternity. I also felt like I was losing myself, sense of myself, going comoletely mad. 

Suddenly I threw up. A lot... After that I went back to my bed and somehow fell asleep, while having so extremely weird dreams of course. 

Just woke up, it's been 14 hours and I am still really high, this sucks so much. I just want this to be over. I am never in my life touching anything that has to do with marijuana."
492,0,"Man I spent like the past two years of my life researching the hell out of these things, immensely fascinated by their method of action and trip reports and the changes they put into effect in people's lives, but then two months ago I finally get my hands on some 100% pure LSD (which many swear as being their favorite psychedelic). I've taken doses from 10ug-300ug, and while yes, this compound's effects are very cool, I cannot understand how ANYONE could find this drug recreational. Yet somehow, all my friends pop a tab like it's nothing and just start cracking up for 12 hours. I'm just jealous. Not to be a douche but I wonder if people who can have trips like that just have less going on in their brains, lol..

I'm not going to act like LSD hasn't changed my perception in any way, but I can't say I had any big revelations. Many people act as if LSD is the teacher and you are the student, but I look at LSD more as just a drug that gives you psychotic symptoms. I could see LSD as being more useful for me in terms of cementing current beliefs than it is for opening up your mind to new beliefs.

In terms of something awesome I did get out of LSD, I had a pretty uncomfortable trip on 300ug and it helped resurface repressed feelings towards the suicide of my best friend when I was a sophomore in High School. I took the trip right near the anniversery of his death and with the help of a therapy appointment the next day, I was able to cry out so much of the trauma I had building up inside of me, that I was only able to intellectualize and not connect emotionally with for years from it being too intense to deal with. Perfect example of not getting the trip you want, but rather, the one you need."
493,0,"So I’m stuck in lockdown, want to ration my weed as I was racing through it due to a built up tolerance. Got some just before my country went into total lockdown about five days ago and was alarmed by how quick I was going through it, and how less Intense my highs were in return. I’ve smoked occasionally for a good few years, but more days than not since about November with a few 1-7 day breaks scattered here and there. Usually I’d only smoke 1-2 bowls late at night. So I built up a good bit of tolerance, but I could still get fairly baked so I was fine with it: 

Was recently away for 4 days, felt a lot higher after I came back. Two weeks later I can barely get high. I’ve been waking and baking non stop since there wasn’t much else to do. The magic was gone so to speak: and after 40 minutes I barely felt high anymore, usually I still feel high for at least two hours. While I feel 100% more “functional” on weed now, I’d really rather be back incapacitated on my couch off on some crazy adventure inside my head.

499,0,"With the current lockdown am finding it impossible to find proper weed. I think we're all wishing we'd stocked up, but.
So my local grocers sells many CBD products and have tried out a couple.
Firstly bought CBD hash for £10( about a gramme).
 No real effect. Rather disappointed especially as it claimed to contain Terpenes which may impart THC_type flavours/aroma.
 Went to bed a bit cheesed off. But on waking in the a.m. was noticeably much more drowsy than normal, in a pleasant way, like I could sleep a few hours more without problem.
So, for me at least it may aid sleep.
 Today bought some CBD weed which tastes a bit better(£15 for about a gramme!!) but so far no effect.
Let yer know."
2,0,"I offered my friendship with nothing to hide,  


That stranger's poem made me fear that he'd already died.  


I felt the poet's heavy heart; how his hurt, his poetry screamed.  


He felt so *almost* unreachable, for death he had prepared and preened.  

  



But dead he was not!  


And over those long nights,  


We talked and talked til in dawned the lights.  


That poet once strange, he became my friend,  


Though never without a sense of impend.  

  



Because we both in identical loath,  


Cycled our days like we'd sworn an oath.  


He nodded on heroin, I danced with speed;  


Little did we know, just in the end how  


Oh how we'd cut and bleed...  

  



Because loving him dopesick tore me apart;  


I cried out that ""please, let's both just restart!""  


A life exists beyond that sweet, sweet hell...  


I was so happy when he hesitantly glanced out that prison cell.  

  



It was goodbye to heroin, as in whelmed the rush;  


All the emotions he'd always tried to kill and crush.  


I stood by his side, called around the clock,  


But at the back of my head I heard a sly knock.  

  



The oldest friend of them all, it was back.  


It was speed, my need, reminding me that it had never left;  


""He'll never own your heart because that's called theft"".  


He definitely knew, even through his chills and aches and cries,  


That I had always been chained with these rusty iron ties.  

  



We both tried so hard to win,  


It was me and him versus speed and heroin.  


Surely these substances couldn't throw it all to the bin?  

  



But all it took  


Was speed's sneaky little hook;  


During a moment a little too weak...  


Our castle of glass now bared a creak,  


And in could our ending leak.  

  



Before I surrendered to my binding death kiss,  


I thought of things far worthier than this.  


But then, I felt it, oh GOD there was the pain,  


From I couldn't hide, no pretense to feign.  


  


I was hurting, I was hurting,  


And maybe selfish, that too.  


With speed prowling and flirting,  


""Take me"", my lips were finally blurting.  

  



I remembered the pain,   


The violence and the rain.  


Starting from six or seven years old,  


My sister and I were held in that boiler room cold.  


It was just my mom's punishment, no food nor light.  


We'd take turns sitting on the only chair, surrendered to the fight.  


We'd tell each other happy stories to keep us running sane,  


But never before beating the locked doors until our wrists would sprain.  


If I strayed there now, what would I find again?  


Tiny nail marks and a faded bloodstain.  

  



And I remember the vain  


Of begging to please stop;  


For their hands on my private parts to tire and drop.  


After twelve I switched to pants, uniform skirts claimed I disliked,  


The other girls just laughed and called me a dyke.  


I've never hugged my parents since;  


Never kissed without a sob or wince;  


Never felt pure... no matter how I'd scrub and rinse.  

  



More memories pouring in...  


Oh there's no way that I can win...  


The helplessness of seeing my anorexic sister wilting to death;  


Couldn't clear the sound of my friend's gurgling bloodied breath.  


I remember screaming and crying when he took off his pants... We'd met only twice, I think his name was Seth?  

  



Today, I found a needle deep in my arm.  

  



And for a moment   


There was   


A feeling of faint...  


But quickly there was no regret, no alarm, no harm.  


I had pushed that poet to fight his hellish battle,  


But forgotten for my own weapons to disarm.  

  



When I told him, he did not accept;  


He burst with anger, a promise I had not kept.  


Like a long lost lover heroin reeled him back,  


Twelve hours later, dry were his tears as he smoked that victorious smack.  

  



As I shamefully look at the bruises on my arm,  


A new voice coos to me with whispery charm:  


""This was your downfall, your fight is inept...  


So give me a chance and the pain is finally swept.  


You already know that your friend I have kept;   


Choose me and you won't remember why you've ever even wept.""  

  

( I just wanted to share this even though it's kinda scary sharing something *so* personal. Almost all the details in it are true, I have a friend I was helping off heroin but I recently made the mistake to start to IV and my life has spiraled since. A friend is getting me heroin next week, I'm very new to the world of opiates but I crave that thought of all the pain being gone. Just to clarify, the incorrect details are that I'm not actually sure if my friend has relapsed yet or not, and the guy who tried to rape me (I got away!) wasn't named Seth, did it for the rhyme. Also, my sister did almost die but she survived anorexia :)



And to clarify, the boiler room stuff is just how my mom would punish me as a kid, it really messed things up for me. And the childhood sexual abuse was true to the last detail. But I guess it's okay now. I worked hard on this poem so I hope someone enjoys it, thanks all. It's really hard to help someone through addiction when you suck at handling your own shit (I don't really consider myself addicted, but still. Idk. I just don't know with anything anymore) )"
3,0,"I started using at 18. At 20 I was iv using it. Quit for couple of years at 22. 2 years ago I relapsed but did not shoot up more than once this time as I was scared when I shot for the first time after 2 years. The stuffs too strong here in Australia. Or maybe it was because I done it after two years. 

I have been smoking it from last two years and turning 26 tomorrow. I kept promising my self I will be 2-4 months clean by my birthday on 3 April, but the day is here and I haven’t stopped!  My birthday is going to be miserable as it’s day 3, and fucking COLD TURKEY!  

Just needed to vent. I feel like crying. A complete mess. And my parents sit overseas, thinking their son is clean from last few years. They don’t know how sad and broken I am under that fake smile. If had another sibling I would have killed myself by now.

But I am the only son if I kill myself no one will look after my parents when they are elderly."

7,0," My opiate days are long behind me thankfully.. I've always wondered that if one is rich and is addicted to heroin or fentenyl, what happens? What I mean is I've always thought that with opiate addiction, the big problems hit when the addict starts running out of money.. With no money, that means no dope and that means withdrawal which just destroys your ability to function.. Thing is though, there have been very wealthy rock stars with heroin addiction like Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) and Chuck Negron (three dog night)  and they all hit rock bottom 

  Are there rock stars or lawyers or other wealthy folks that have been long term addicted to heroin or fentenyl and are still high functioning? What is the biggest problem that heroin addiction poses to these people? They have enough money to constantly have a nice amount on them so where do the problems come in and what are they? Overdose?

  What about dosages? Does someone's tolerance keep going up over the years to the point where they have to bang gras of dope just to get out of bed?ive read that tolerance eventually has a ceiling effect..right or wrong?"

And what I am basically concerned about is that during that time I might be having a overdose and not even really know it. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there really much of a difference in a overdoses with  I. V. and Insulation? Help would be appreciated? ✌️"

Eventually I can swap out for another formulary to reset my tolerance, but I also have a natural resistance so it's all a struggle. I haven't yet taken 2 roxies at once but I can literally take one every hour up to 4 times and not have any relief. Trying to not move up too fast but also still function and occasionally actually enjoy how I feel. I also have Soma, buspirone, hydroxyzine and 1 lorazepam. What can I do to battle tolerance combined with natural resistance?? Illicit drugs and rx meds that aren't prescribed to me are not an option as I'm urine screened regularly. Help."
15,0,"I'm sure this has been said a million times before. I'm sorry for doing so again but when they say ""your tolerance is gonna stay right up"" when you quit after addiction they're not lying.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, the high was really great the first big dose with both grams. But it wasn't *earth-shattering*. And it wasn't bunk stuff.  I think this phenomenon has sort of happened before but it's kind of extraordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I forget about this come the winter again when I want to partake again? Probably, then I'll regret it again when I see how short $90 lasts me. But at least I've come to sort of an internal understanding that not only is it not worth it, it's like a rip-off! What the hell. At least when I threw parts of my future away during the depths of my hardcore addiction I got where I was coming from. Staying clean is a lifelong thing I guess but getting clean in the first place now is almost a breeze. I just feel so stupid. A gram. Gone! That quickly! AHH.

Now a month later I’m not sure if it’s the same pharmacist as I had last month but on the phone they are saying there is a doctors note that says basically the same thing

They refuse to show proof even tho I told them I switched for a reason and explained why I would be suspicious

So now I’m in same boat and I’m thinking maybe this is just some unwritten Walgreens bullshit to lie to patients because there is no way I can call their bullshit is to call my doctor and with all this covid 19 shit they are only there a few hours a week.

I plan on coming off of about a 30 day run starting next week.  I have been taking about 15-30 mg of oxy pharma or oxy presses a day for the last 25 days or so.  

This was not supposed to happen, but Im an idiot and it did and here I am... afraid to stop because the withdrawals will suck. 

I am aware they are going to suck, but have gotten some tools to hopefully help me stay sane through days 2-4.  

How much methadone do you think I will need with a 15-30 mg habit for just the past month just to make the withdrawals a little more bar-able? I am not trying to switch one addiction for another, but just simply make the withdrawals a little easier days 2-4.

Day 2. I don’t know how I’m going to do this. The pain is just indescribable. I want to be a New person. I don’t think anyone would want to be me.

53,0,"About 12 days ago I made a post talking about how an Empire vendor had decided to exit scam in response to the coronavirus: [https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/flk708/the\_corona\_virus\_triggered\_a\_fortuitous\_domino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/flk708/the_corona_virus_triggered_a_fortuitous_domino/)

I considered myself lucky at the time, because I was already 14 days clean by that point, and I decided that not receiving my 28x40mg Oxy order was a good thing. 

Well, a couple of days ago the postman puts a package in my hand, and in that moment I'm both elated and distraught. I know exactly what's in it, and I know what I'm in for. 

That was 3 days ago. I've used 2 days in a row since then. 

I'm not in a bad place at all, however. Just a few days ago I spoke to my mother for the first time in years. I put all my festering anger behind me, and it felt fucking great. Like a weight off my chest.

And I must say: not having that festering anger in me makes opiate use much more pleasant. I used to think it was the opiates that gave me the rage, but now I think they just shone a light on something that already existed."

This is why formulation of a pill matters, as for the BA across different ROA's.

I suspect there is a similar case with morphine pills and intranasal BA.  The ones I did years ago  had such shitty BA at probably 20% tops, but I've read other studies that say intranasal is on par with oral."

So I stuck the needle in one spot, didn't work out, changed needle and tried a different spot. In the end I just gave up because I couldn't do it. At one time I thought I did it, so I plunged to see if there was blood and there was, but I think the needle either went further in or out right before I injected so it didn't actually go into the vein. I instantly noticed a small bump under my skin and I stopped immediately. Now after 2 days my entire arm is starting to feel weird and I have some barely noticeable blue spots on it.

Almost like goosebumps, but inside the arm and it is not comfortable.

If youve never shot up. DONT do it.

PLEASE.

ive been sort of half-assing trying to get sober lately... Luckily i have a place near me where i can do therapy and get suboxone and do some out-patient rehab.

I know for sure that I cant continue down this path. Ive done it before and it doesnt end anywhere good.

Im one of the assholes who throws everything out for heroin. Or almost everything.

Well, hope fully this doesnt end with me dead or in jail.

However, I know for it to end in a way anything other than disastrously, I gotta get sober.

But holy fuck it felt good yall 😋😤🤔"
98,0,"I'm sitting here trying yet again to make a withdrawal work and I'm just so sick of myself I figure let's hear what internet strangers say, because obviously I'm beyond stupid.

**Brief history:** years of IV street drugs abuse escalated to daily speedballs, briefly sober (gabapentin ONLY) for half a year then relapsed only on heroin, now on this relapse a little over a year with dozens of w/d attempts like these

**Buprenorphine:**

A few weeks ago I tried doing the serious real doctor MAT route, I had a weekly script of 16mg bupe/day, but the induction was rough and the truth is I kept slamming dope, the best streak I got was like three days clean, so a couple weeks ago I just gave up and stopped going. 

I still have a good stash of bupe from that experience. I've been trying to do a Bernese induction so **for the past three days I've dosed super small pieces in the morning (.5-1mg)** before giving in and shooting dope in the afternoon. Today, the dope shot was really small (a point) because... I want to stop. I don't want to shoot dope tomorrow. :-( I *have* been 'sick' more often than not the past three days just from cutting down to one dose per 24 hours.

At this point I don't even know if getting stabilized on bupe is my goal. I mean even though it didn't 'work' before (or work yet), 3 days clean was the best I had done in the past year. If I did manage to get stabilized on it and stopped shooting heroin, I would be happy and would go back to the MAT clinic to keep taking it.

**Other Opioid Taper Options**

The other option is to keep tapering down with other short acting full agonists, to get off the dope. I have a bunch of **Morphine 60mg pills, and Tramadol 50mg pills**. Maybe I could taper off the street dope injections with these guys? Could I even do that *on top of* continuing to take super small bupe doses in the morning, to get my bupe levels up? (in preparation for complete bupe induction)

Let me be super honest, it's been just a few hours since that point and I'm hurting. Physically and emotionally. FUCK I just don't want to shoot more dope, I literally cry thinking I'm gonna do it again... **so maybe if I boof some morphine it will help me not do that? Taper me down more gently?**

Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthdays. And I'm NEVER there for her cause of this addiction. But I doubt I will be functional in 24 hours (birthday dinner time) just counting on the bupe. I want to be functional but I don't want to shoot more street dope.

**Other comfort med options:**

Look at everything I have! I'm such a little bitch about this!

Gabapentin 300mg - got 3 month script so about 180 pills. Usually helps my w/d pains really well. I'm popping them all day but honestly have not yet tried the 'massive' amounts often suggested for w/d (&gt;2500mg), despite usually reacting well to it. Should I just try that? On top of or instead of the other opioid options? If I end up stabilizing on just gabapentin every day, I would be happy with that. (that's how I got six months sober a year ago)

Xanax 2mg bars, obvious presses - like a hundred left. Works well to knock me out. Very sluggish feeling though. Been taking .25mg EVERY night for a while now, more lately to try to get through some hours of w/d, but I do not like the barred out feeling and don't want to get dependent. 

Cannabis and CBD - just copious, copious. Has enabled me binge watching hours and hours of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and that big cat show.

Hydroxyzine 50mg - 45 tabs. Very nice dr at MAT clinic prescribed these to help me sleep without resorting to the xanax. Have not tried them yet.

Propranalol - blood pressure meds left over from old script for anxiety attacks

I do not drink alcohol at all any more - that's a nasty drug yall. 

So yeah. All you seasoned junkies out there, give me your best ideas for how to proceed over these next few days with what I've got. Please. The desperation."

I have been on Methadone for 2 days, but my tolerance is so high that the 30mg is just not nearly enough. Today I messed up and ran into the wrong crowd and used Heroin, Crack, and Meth. Tomorrow I have something called testing and I am now getting pretty worried that they are going to discontinue my methadone which will be the end of me because I can’t live the junkie life any longer it’s just gotten too dangerous every day for me. 

Can someone let me know what this testing consists of? And if they are going to throw me out of the clinic for using all these drugs on just my second day. 

Thank you!"

Shortly after completing rehab im back in my grandparents house. I start dipping again and eventually back to full blown. My grandfather changed his pin so that was no longer an option. So they would leave their checkbook on the microwave and one day i decided to write myself a check and see if it works. It does. So i start doing this a lot. One day my grandparents come to me and say can you help us set up online banking? I knew i was fucked but not like i can say no. So i set it up and they are just looking through and up pops all these checks for me. They put me out again. This time i was out for a few weeks and gave up and went back to treatment. 

I complete again and back at my grandparents. I start using again and this friend of mine who's house im at is sniffing what i knew wasn't an oxy. So i ask what it is and it's heroin. I am standing there with my 4 30s crushed up and i say to him "" you need help bro that's junkie shit"". I go back to same house next day and he convinces me to try it. I said how much is this and he said 10.00. I was blown away by that. Here i am spending hundreds a day that i don't have and this jus got me well and high for 10.00??? I never did oxycodone again. I was still living with my grandparents again at this time and with this newfound cheap drug i could afford it. (For a while) 

Eventually i had a huge tolerance for heroin and it was getting costly. At this point my grandparents hid the checkbook and i didn't know the pin on his debit card. One night i went and looked in my grandfather's wallet and i knew he didn't put cash in there but his bank card was there. So i schemed and made an online Western Union account and since you only need the card number, expiration, and 3 numbers on back i added his card and started sending myself Western union. Eventually they found out and put me out. I was on the streets for 2 months because it was warm weather. 

Since then I've been let back and kicked out numerous times and eventually became ok being homeless. I was homeless 18 months straight and the winter was a mother. My family still always wanted me to do right but just didn't want me getting high in their house. When i am clean they do anything in the world for me. If im in treatment they make sure i have cigs and everything.

Im currently in treatment right now through drug court. I am on methadone and am prescribed klonopin. So i cheat the system (really myself) by buying extra klonopin and phinergan."

Anyway, I railed it and sat in my car. I wanna say about 5 minutes later I don’t really remember what happened but I had “nodded off” if you will. I regained consciousness about 15 minutes later and woke up scared, confused, like I wasn’t in reality and I was drenched in sweat. Sweating like I had just been in a sauna. The delirium was intense and I got nauseous and threw up. From then on I felt super fucked up and just wanted to lay down and sleep because of how exhausted tired I was and lethargic.

105,0,"Hello,
I take about 300mg of Oxycodone a day. I’ve found that anytime I run out early, I’m able to take Gabapentin and it eliminates really any symptoms of WD I have. However, the longest I’ve had to take Gabapentin is about 2 days. I haven’t had to go any longer than about 2 days between my oxy script running out and refill day. I’ve been taking oxy on and off for 10+ years but consistently daily for the last 4 years.

1. I’m about to be out of my oxy for 4-5 days. If Gabapentin works for me for 2 days to eliminate WD symptoms, will it work for 4-5 days? Or have I not really experienced full blown WD symptoms since 48 hours really isn’t that long to experience WD?

2. If I take the Gabapentin for the 4-5 days and then stop taking the Gabapentin, and don’t take oxy, will my WD’s start all over again or will I truly be 4-5 days into “detox”?

I hope any of this made sense. I am kind of terrified.

Also my whole body just kind of felt a little more sensitive if that makes sense. For real, any and all info you have about Ashwagandha and opioids would be extremely appreciated if you shared it. I just wanna know if I can use this to help lower my tolerance while I go on a break from the roxies so I can enjoy the ones I have left and not need to do 5 of them to get as high as I want.

I've searched and searched the internet and cannot find what ALL of the exact ingredients are that are in these oxycodones. I want to know, I want to know what is in them and how they make them.

I thought we had a working relationship but clearly not. I was instantly cut off during a fucking pandemic. I am so lucky I found a new place that was able to give me an appt the next day. Someone is watching out for me, I’ve never been able to get a PM appt at a new practice within even a week. Honestly, if this pandemic shit wasn’t going on I don’t think I would’ve gotten my script back so easily at a new doctor. They barely questioned me, super professional though, then wrote me my scripts. Tried to schedule an injection, but insurance won’t cover anything until this pandemic is over unless it’s an emergency. So I got my scripts back, which for the last week I was coming to terms with that I am going to be out of for a couple weeks, or who even knows how long because I didn’t think I couldn’t find a new PM doctor during all of this.

Im chillen yesterday off 4 mg kpin, and my buddy is back in town serving pharma schoolbusses and roxis.

Needless to say i copped 2 xanax and 2 roxi. Ended up on 4 mg kpin 30 mg oxy and quarter of a bar that evening and had one of the nicest nights since this bullshit started.

Fyi, ULDN is ultra low dose naltrexone. At the microgram doses people use for this, it won't throw opiate users into precipitated withrdrawal.

There's a lot of information on this subject over bbn on the kratom subreddit, apparently people have had decent success with it there."

In 1898, Bayer introduced the world to heroin.  It was marketed as a wonder drug alleviating symptoms from the common cough to the most severe pain.  Sears actually sold injection kits over the counter.  It soon found its way into morphine addicts for its extreme euphoric effects.  In the early 1910’s, people took a notice and started heavy regulating the sale of heroin and the easy access junkies. Now this is where the coincidence comes into play.
From January 1918 to December 2020 the world experienced the worst recorded pandemic in world history.  The H1N1 virus, or known as the Spanish flu, wiped out a quarter of the worlds population (over 500 million back then).  
Fast Forward to today
In 1996, Purdue Pharmacy introduced the world to Oxycontin.  It was prescribed as a non-addictive miracle cure for pain.  It was quickly recognized by addicts for its extreme euphoric effects.  Pill Mills became a regular thing for anyone with $300 and a MRI.  Once fees were paid, doctors would write the script for the holy trinity of Scripts; Oxcycontin, Soma’s, and 2 mg alprazolam.  At the closing of the first decade of the 21st century, the public had become increasingly worried about the pill mills and easy access to the drug OxyContin and action was taken to shut these clinics down.  The Feds were not satisfied and created the opioid crisis to combat all opioids and restrict them to virtually no legal access and succeeded.  At the end of the second decade of the 21st century, Covid-19 (Corona virus) began making news about its deadly respiratory effects and highly contagious properties.  On January 20 the US reported it’s first confirmed case of Covid -19.  Fast Forward not even two months and we are on the way to The Worst pandemic in human history.

As an addict, I can attest that during my heavy use, I Rarely got sick with a virus and when I was sick, a .2 shot would bring a fever of 102.3 down to 98.5 in minutes.  I wish they would look into Diamorphine as a treatment in hospitals to help those suffering.  It could save the ventilators for patients who seriously need them.  I know people are thinking that’s nonsense to think of heroin as a remedy, especially after the governments big fight against the opioid (fentanyl) crisis, but when people are considering taking Mefloquine (the same chemical used to clean fish tanks) as a last resort, does heroin really sound that crazy?

What do you think?  This has been burning in my head but no one wants to listen to “the drug seeking words” of an addict.  I knew you guys would be more open to this discussion."

I would just like to say, for the people who used IV for years and was able to get sober.. you are amazing. Sometimes I feel like because I wasn’t using for so long like a lot of IV addicts do, that it wasnt really comparable.. like my addiction wasn’t as bad and not worth talking about. If you know what I mean? I was only using for like 6 months but heroin knows no time. It lost a lot in 6 months. 
Anyway haha I haven’t used heroin in almost 4 years but recently I had a friend who can get suboxone (could be spelling wrong) and me and my boyfriend eat some sometimes. I kinda feel guilty lol? I don’t go around preaching “sober” - I still smoke weed and obviously dabble in drugs sometimes haha.. but pretty rarely. But I won’t touch H again. The withdraw experience has really kept me away. I cannot imagine What withdrawals are like if you have been using for a year or more. 

but am I the only one? Who has over come an addiction but you still kinda dabble in other things and have become better with self control? I just like doing drugs sometimes and I’m tired of feeling bad about it it 😂"
145,0,"For several years now I’ve been curious on heroin and looking to try some. The problem is, I don’t know anyone using heroin or where to get it. I don’t know why but it seems that there is no heroin users (or dealers) in my country. I know a lot of dealers and drug users, but nobody uses or know where to get it. 


Anyway yesterday my friend introduced me to a nurse who works at a ward for terminal cancer. He offered to hook me up on some hospital grade morphine for quite cheap. My friend has gotten some oxy(also rare in my country) from this nurse before and vouch that his shit is good and not been cut bad shit. 


So my question is:
- Are the effects of injecting morphine and heroin similar?
- Does morphine have a higher risk of addiction than heroin?


I don’t really worry on getting addicted, really just a one time thing, just to get a taste of all drugs available.

I’ve already tried molly, lsd, shrooms, pot, oxy, methadone, meth, amphetamine, codeine, cbd, nitrazepam, eremin-5, nitrous, and kratom. Didn’t get addicted to any of it except kratom, which I drink daily. Thats why I’m not worried on getting addicted on morphine."

I’m using opioids from codeine up to oxy and hydromorphone but just by swallowing, I’m never snorting or something else.

Is that really a freaking tolerance?
How much hydromorphone would someone have to swallow if he’s shooting up something on the daily ?"

149,0,"I have a ball of pure heroin that I want to give out to friends and sell. Only problem being is that pure heroin is very rare to find on the street in any shape or form, but shitty low quality heroin can also be found easily. My intentions aren’t to make it shitty in terms of purity. I want to cut it so that my friends and customers don’t die because they did a dose they can normally do on the street. 

Now before any of you get mad (which I know there will be) you must realize how fucking strong pure heroin is. You can complain that I’m cutting my shit but it is purely for my use and the use of friends and customers. That being said what is a good cutting agent with the following characteristics (not all have to apply)

1. Water soluble

2. “Safe” to inject

3. Easy to obtain 

4. Safe to ingest 

Again not all of these characteristics have to apply but it would be nice. Finally to all the people who will complain, I could easily cut this with Tylenol or some other dark brown shit but I care about who gets this that’s why I’m asking.

I took one, didn’t feel shit. Next day I took two and I felt so warm and heavy. A couple weeks later I nodded out for the first time

My use was pretty infrequent, making it a once on the weekends sort of thing. I searched my parents cabinet and found some hydrocodone, and more codeine pills. I hit the jackpot. Of course it’s hard to sit on that sort of stuff. I was pretty good at self control, but I love that shit. Ever since this whole quarantine shits happening I’ve been doing opis more and more. I’ve damn near binged on hella codeine and hydrocodone (codeine works for me pretty well). But I can feel the tolerance building up a lil bit already even tho I’ve only done shit three times a week at most. I also feel super fucking lethargic and just like shit in general a day or two after I haven’t had any opis. A couple days ago I went to my grandma’s house to get some tramadol out her cabinet and honestly I feel kinda bad for that.

I walked inside they said only one person inside the building at a time bc in my area is pretty bad with covid-19 so I said okay walked back to my car. The person walked out and someone called me in. I walked inside and told them I had was having bad pain on my lower back and I had a small cough(I had no cough just seeing what happens) first thing he said was no cough medicine only pain. I said okay. I filled out some paperwork (only took cash) he didn’t ask about insurance. I got on the scale and told him how much I weighed and everything he stayed back. Kinda odd. Basically I ended up paying $70 for a script of 30 10/325 hydros.  I thought he was gonna try to give me naproxen or something like that but I told him I tried everything and been in pain still he insisted on giving me a shot for inflammation I may have but I told the dr I’d rather not bc it was $50 extra. So I go back in 2 months for a follow up. Literally 15mins. I paid $17 at the pharmacy which also took 15 mins. I called a buddy of mine and got rid of 4 for 60 and 5 for 50. I got my money back.

I understand fent test strips exist but from what I read you could test an area and it be fent free but other parts still have fent in it. 

Let me get to the point, if I smoked tar and it happened to be laced with fent would I OD? Even if I was taking small hits and waiting every 15 minutes?

I honestly feel like the only way out of all this is just to finally kill myself. I overdosed again about a month and a half ago and it was so peaceful.

But maintained. Until someone was doing lines of black and I decided I wanted to try to it. Needless to say, it's heroin, it felt amazing. 

Fast forward to may of 2017, I've been a full blown addict for some time now. I quit my job with 30k in the bank, 1600 a month in car payments, 1800 a month on condo and apartment payments, and an insatiable heroin habit. Thinking I'd be fine for 6 months and I could just get high full time. Fucking lol!

3 months later my Cayenne and Camaro are both repossessed, my condo foreclosed on, I'm living in a shitty apartment I only had before to sleep off my drunkenness so I wouldn't have to drive. I have no money in the bank and a ball a day habit at this point. I started selling.

I could go on and on with stories about selling dope. But I won't. I only ever tried to make enough money to not be homeless, have something to eat every once in a while, and enough h to smoke every waking minute of every day. It fucking ruled me.

I had racked up 6 warrants mostly for traffic stuff I never went to court for, but also possession and retail theft. I decided the only way I'd quit is if I turned myself in and kicked h in jail. 

My family is super Mormon and when I told them I was an addict, they just kind of shunned me. I decided to turn myself in November 18th last year. I spent almost 2 months in jail. It had cost me everything, I had nothing to lose.

I've been clean off everything since then, haven't even had a drink. When 2 years ago, I said I'd never quit and was planning on dying from it one day. Im happy with life now though. I have goals again, which are very important.

Substance abuse is a symptom of an underlying problem. Don't underestimate going to see a therapist that can help you work through your shit to get to the root of your problem. Don't try to work through it with someone you know, therapists signed up for the shit and that's what you pay them for. Im a big advocate for psychedelics for helping people work through their stuff it really did wonders for me. And the science backs it up. 

I know I'm not gonna change anyone's mind about their drug use, no one could change mine. A lot of us have lost people to it. Just wanted to let people know the rabbit hole is deep and you can fall down it. And you might not think so now but you can be happy without it."

184,0,"Because of all this extra free time being stuck alone I've had my dosage needed to get the job done has been going up a lot the last month. It was about 20mg of oxy to get me where I want to be in February and it's gotten up to about 40mg now. I typically use 3 times a week, but I had a few days of sequential use a few weeks ago which I think is what really jacked up my tolerance. About how long of a break would I need to take to get my tolerance back down to 20mg to get my desired high. I'd also be trying to keep my usage down to once a week in order to keep it there since idk what supply is going to be looking like with corona. I can also potentate what I have with kpins so if anyone has any advice on that it would be great. Thanks guys, stay safe out there."
186,0,"Was seeing reports from Michigan saying that, people who did not fit a criteria for medical care. (not sure the exact criteria, but i'm assuming old, underlying conditions, low probability of survival, ect.) Would not be treated or admitted to the hospital, however, they would receive pain medication and be sent home. Now, im not entirely sure how much pain medication there are receiving.  Obviously this is for compassion, knowing you are going to die and the actual pain of covid19.    

My tin foil hat comes on because i'm wondering how these people will be counted in death tolls? I'm assuming that like the rest of america, that these people sent home to die will not be tested for covid19. I'm also assuming that won't be tested after their deaths. However, i do believe they will see that they were prescribed pain medication and are now dead, with the only logical conclusion being that they overdosed, and their deaths will be used as a political talking point about how they committed suicide and used drugs because the economy was too low and they were allowed to go back to work."
187,0,"I just had someone on here say they’ve had their prescription Mbox30s break in half real easily just like I was talking about, and every once in a while his prescription Mbox 30s will be a little harder to snap in half.

I’ve been doing roxies for the last 5 days in a row (gunna take a break today) and I just picked up some Mbox 30s today and I’ve never had that bran so I decided to do some, I posted the pics and you can look at my profile to see them if you’d like. 

They feel and taste just like normal Roxies and I got exactly as high as I expected for the amount I took and for how my tolerance has been during this binge. 

Has anyone else ever had Mbox 30s that were 100% legit and they broke in half or quarters very easily? 

They’re not soft enough to where when I take a chunk and roll it around my fingertips with pressure they won’t turn into dust in my fingers, it still stays a chunk.  I think they’re just old like one person had told me. And they’ve been handled a lot and in multiple peoples pockets for long times bundled up in paper towel.

By J.L. Dobbins

Her name is Katie and yes that is her real name. She is the only non-fictionalized character herein- I do pray she sues me for this. Maybe then I can see her again. After all she stuns in her courtroom attire. I loved her dearly and she loved me barely less but I was enslaved by shackles hiding amongst the syringes and balls of cotton and feverish frantic nights. And we tugged that way, back and forth, an ebb and flow for which only one end we could know, doomed and star crossed in our passionate fucking. I still dream of her. Last night she appeared to me and the dream felt like 30 seconds passed before I woke up cumming myself. Then an embarrassing trip to grab a sock.  That’s a true walk of shame. I lied back in bed and turned to the cellular but i know she’s long blocked my contact so instead i watch the final scene of Forrest Gump because I want to weep and miss her. There’s a comfort to it and paradoxically but in truth still, I feel closer to her. Yep, I begin to weep. “I miss you, Jenny.” I miss her too, bud.

I may be a smart man, but i wish i knew what love is. The yearning I felt for her, the outward love thought to have shown and the despair at her absence, it didn’t amount to love because it couldn’t be love because i didn’t and still don’t love myself. 

Maybe if these words make me rich I’ll learn to love because they say money can’t buy happiness but it fucking buys shit that makes you happy. 

I chuckle and wonder if she’s for sale.

198,0,"Diving with sharks - J.L. Dobbins

Injecting heroin is compared to many things by perpetrators to all that stands macabre and taboo within society’s underbelly. Many a times, more oft than otherwise, these claims come from false prophets lacking the experience requisite to spew even the most minute truths on the matter. Not having been a true slave, ie a junky, nor even witnessed its affect on such an individual, you people do not hesitate to give your two cents on a matter us ‘members’ feel willing to pay a small fortune just to shut you up about.

I have earned my stripes on this foul yet all telling subject. It takes a certain person to stick the pen through skin and draw the ruby red slosh into a chamber, preparing for its receiver like a slug ready to fire from its barrel and pierce man’s flesh and vein. 

Both in experience and how I share it with others, my first time injecting heroin was like my first time diving with sharks. The fragile nature of life and death is suddenly placed in the hands of a separate force, one certainly less natural yet still a force of nature in its own right. Either said force filled me with joy and appeared as the amalgamation and perception of pure beauty dousing the human soul. But if one or both forces shall choose to turn on me and snatch away my joy and the beauty accompanied by, the experience realizes the true dangers therein and thereby leaves life hanging in the balance. 

Both experiences, heroin and sharks 80 ft deep in crystallized blue waters shining off coasts lined with white sands and locals and huts and capitalism’s grandest all-inclusive resorts and soccer moms with fake tits sipping strawberry daiquiris, were peaceful and nothing more. Fear had no place, though it surely reeked its usual havoc elsewhere on those days. Even As pins and needles slapped my spinal column sparking an untrusted and unfamiliar euphoria, and even as my diving mask filled to my retinas with what blood poured from my pressurized nostrils, I trusted the drug and the shark in those moments. 

But true with both subjects and their controlling forces, if you inject drugs or swim with sharks long enough and/or times a plenty, the day will finally arrive for you to suffer that almighty and terrible bite."

I’m trying to stop Tramadol... again. I know some don’t think this is a big deal but it is for me. Have been taking up to 25-30 or more of the 50mg pills daily for years. Seizures, yes had two of those too and am aware of the daily max recommended limit of this drug. I was assured was non narcotic and non habit forming. LIES!!!

I have 10 Clonazepam 1mg and 10 0.5 Xanax. Also Pregabalin/Lyrica -loads- plus a few Imodium. Can not get clonodine.  When asked if there was a clonodine substitute I was asked if I meant beta blockers.  Ummm, I could have answered that better if I’d known what beta blockers are but I don’t. 

Physically I’m doing alright. Mentally I keep cycling through anger/rage type feelings and just being regular but hella irritable at times. 

I know about the SSRI side of Tramadol. I have some Lexapro/Escitalopram 10 mg, Amitriptyline (Tricyclic) 25 mg and Cymbalta/Duloxetine 20 to choose from to replace the SSRI component. I can buy all of the antidepressants over the counter but do not have a doctor at the moment to tell me what’s best. 

I’m not a doctor. Many reading this are not doctors. With that in mind please feel free to tell me your thoughts, opinions and recommendations as non medical personnel. What would you do? What have you even heard is possible to stop the sound of closing potato chips make me wanna yell and scream. I’ll research it. 

I can not keep feeling like I wanna snap at the people in my house. Nor feel like I wanna ball my fists up and punch anything (nonliving) till my hands bleed.  It’s not stress from being on 24 hour quarantine. I have plenty of Tramadol. Plenty of spaces on the property to be alone and get away. Just mad. 😡 

Any thoughts? Please help me."

Anyways, I ended up telling the doc because this happens every month and the last two years I never had an issue with that, and they won’t increase my meds at all. Anyways, I asked if I could be tapered off because I don’t want to be dependent anymore. This turns them into not be willing to prescribe me anything, and they say they are referring me to another PM clinic. These losers referred me to a rehab facility. I’m not saying anything is wrong with rehab, but I’m not an addict, just a chronic pain patient. I have 4 sandoz oxy 40s that I haven’t touched in 5 days since I ran out. I know I’m not addicted or I would’ve taken one. I’m dependent. Anyways, trying to find a new PM clinic during this time is fucking awful.

It sucks but at least I'm not sick. Been in my house 18 fucking days straight, fortunately my wealth allows this but not everyone is so lucky. Aren't y'all a little freaked out???

I couldn’t deal with it and started using again that day and have been daily since then. 2 days ago I made the attempt again using subutex(same waiting period, just had been using less then usual the week prior) I had the same exact result.

• I think large gauge IV access is horribly underused. When done properly it's multiple times more sterile, much more safe, can administer other medications if it becomes necessary. When done by someone who knows what they're doing, it doesn't destroy vasculature &amp; can safely be left in through the duration of the high for emergency use. 

• I feel like naloxone is horribly misused too. Around here at least based on my 2nd hand knowledge, they just slam 0.4mg naloxone intranasal or intramuscular on heroin ODs until they're consious &amp; breathing. Imho, slamming naloxone is only if the patients breathing is getting real shitty real fast. 

• Aside from naloxone being misused, I think there's more effective uses as well. Dilute naloxone (3mg/500ml bag or 3mg/10ml injection) is great, just adjust the rate by the patients breathing &amp; level of responsiveness. I've also encountered a couple times where patients are alert with adequate respiratory drive but shitty air movement, and i've personally seen 2mg naloxone + 3mg albuterol nebulized work great on that. 

• Suboxone/methadone is a horrible idea in my opinion, vivitrol is multiple times safer and effective. I have 6 ""patients"" on suboxone (who've repeatedly relapsed, 2 of which have ODd on suboxone). The 13 I have on vivitrol report no issues or cravings at all.

Does anyone else know of any overused, underused, or misused practices in harm reduction - particularly as it comes to harm reduction clinics?"

244,0,I have 48mg( two 24mg capsules) of hydromorph. The capsules I got have tons of tiny beads.  The guy I got them from said to not take more then 15 beads at once or I could OD. But there is more then 1000 beads between the two of them and that dose wouldn’t do anything. He has me abit anxious so I don’t want to take to many. I snorted about 75 of the beads and didn’t really feel anything. I don’t want to waste them though. I don’t have a tolerance to opiates. Does anyone have an idea of about how many beads would be safe to take to get high? I was tempted to try and count them to figure out how much a mg would be but counting out 1000+ beads does not sound like a good time lol. And the beads from both capsules i already mixed together without thinking. Please help 😅

246,0,"So before our country realized covid was an actual threat (early March) I checked myself into rehab to finally detox off a nasty oxy habit. I originally was just gonna stay for detox and call it a day but I knew in my heart I needed and wanted to stay for the full rehab. Unfortunately covid 19 cut my time there short. It was not safe for me, someone who’s immunocompromised to stay at the rehab when they were admitting tens of new patients a day. I’m sad I had to leave because otherwise I wouldn’t have. When I left detox only then did I realize the dire situation at hand, since we weren’t allowed to have our phones the second I got mine back I realized coronavirus was serious. They downplayed it in rehab and there were a lot of sick people there!! Anyway I felt a crushing pain in my chest knowing I had no support coming out of an aborted rehab stint. No meetings to go to, no way to stay on the upswing with motivation. I was super motivated to get clean, still want to, and will return to rehab once this is all over. But I did relapse and you all know what my excuse is already. I haven’t seen another soul in weeks because I’m on quarantine. Shit fucking blows. I figured I’d take this opportunity originally to stay sober then my dealer hit me up. Then I found out my oxy script went thru. And then it was over from there. I guess I just wanna say to all those struggling or who relapsed cuz of this pandemic, don’t beat yourselves up. These times are unprecedented; and no one can prepare themselves to react properly all the time. We can do it, we can and will get clean once this is all over, or before if you’re willing. If not take this extra time to be really cautious about copping, I have my money in the trunk of my car and my dealer swaps it for the goods for example. Don’t do hand to hand transactions if you can help it. Godspeed, family."

My sweet spot for kratom is 2.5 Gs so im assuming it would be higher to curve WD? I was using 30mg a day for 3 weeks and 40 mg this last week.

254,0,"My insurance is okay with it, I'm pretty sure my doctor is okay with it if insurance is. But will the pharmacy be okay with it? I asked them recently and they said i'm over reacting. But during this time with telemedicine coming into play (for me atleast, this past week) and that e-scripts for narcotics are being okay'd . I'm just curious if anyone's had any luck getting a 90 day prescription?

256,0,"I figured you guys would get a kick outta what just happened to me. 

So I’m getting a prescription for Oxycodone 30mg for a couple months until I heal from a recent surgery. 

I don’t take pain pills too often so of course I split them. About an hour ago I head to the kitchen to use my pill cutter. Now, I have a pet mouse who escaped her cage earlier and as she was running away from me she kept leaving droppings. I catch her. Put her back and proceed to clean up her poo, and throw it in the trash. I figured, hey why not clean the cage a bit while I’m at it and dumped the bottom of her cage in the bin as well. 

So, after that’s all said and done, I remove my gloves, wash my hands and go to cut my Oxy 30 in half. Pick up the pill cutter empty it into my hand, bc i thought I saw a centipede I kinda jumped back and flung my hands up and .. yep! You guessed it. One half fell right in my poo filled trash right next to me. 

Now I’m like, fuckkkkk! Do I really want to dig to the bottom of my MOUSE SHIT filled trash to get this? Like how fucking gross would I be? But fuck, real script Oxy 30’s are sooo rare these days! . . . . Threw more gloves back on and got to digging. 

So since the bag isn’t completely full, I look in the small empty gaps in the corners first and please just take a look where this fucking pill ended up landing. . . .

UH HUH! I’m like wtf...should I still keep it?! OF FUCKING COURSE. I grabbed that little sucker. Gave it a quick spray of Lysol disinfectant. Good to go. 

Probably not, but there’s only one way to find out!! 

What would you guys have done?? Curious to know."

258,0,Hi all. So I've been addicted for the past two years with the first year being consumed by fent presses oxys which I absolutely loved. I couldn't afford to maintain that habit and moved on to heroin for the past year. I withdrew from the fent several times with rls and cold sweats being my worst symptoms. I'm planning to detox from the heroin soon and am curious if I should be expecting similar symptoms from withdrawals or if they may vary from previous due to a change in substance i'll be withdrawing from. Thanks for the help in advance! Happy nods to all and to all a goodnight!
259,0,"Hey all. So I’ve been attempting to ween myself off Oxy for a while now. Almost a year into my addiction. It all started when I got my wisdom teeth out lol. I just liked the feeling and that nothing bothered me when I was high.

But I hate being enslaved to this shit. And it’s just getting in the way of so much personal growth and amazing blessings and opportunities I have. 

I get 50 oxy 30s every week from a pain clinic, along with a plethora of benzos and other narcotics. All for free. So I could be making BANK if I didn’t use. Instead I get stressed and set aside some for myself and don’t make half as much as I could. So I’m missing out there. I also have noticed I’m so so so much happier when I’m just beginning to withdraw/not be high, it’s bizarre. I’ll be smoking weed and be so much more in the moment, not just on auto-pilot. It rocks! 

I want to quit. I’m just scared.... but I don’t even know of what! It’s almost like it’s my lizard brain telling me I need this shit to be ok. I’ve been weening, used to do about 100mg a day and now I’m down to 30-45mg. Smoking (dabs, I’m a MMJ patient) helps a TON with keeping my mind off the stuff. And quarantine is helping a bunch too. I want control of my life again, not to be enslaved to this dumb M30. And I could be making so much more money, really setting myself up for the future (I don’t even have a car rn). I barely have ANY friends, none of which no about my addiction. Nobody does. I just want to not be a zombie, not be all percolated and shit, I just feel REAL and like, I feel MY SOUL when I’m not on this shit

So I guess I’m just asking, for help? For a push to tell me I’ll be okay if I quit? I’m not too sure. But some responses would be helpful. I’m just stuck at home and have really been trying to focus on myself and better myself and reconnect with myself and become someone I can love again. I’m getting antsy right now, just typing this is making me feel uncomfortable, it’s ridiculous. Please just tell me I can do this, and give me some advice on how to just KICK THIS SHIT ONCE AND FOR ALL. 

Thank you guys in advance and much love!"
260,0,What’s your “just scored” song that you blast on the way home?
261,0,This drug has always intrigued me. It’s one of the few painkillers I haven’t tried along with Opana. I know it is rarely prescribed In the United States. I read that Harold Shipman the famous serial killer was addicted to this drug and that it differs a bit from other typical opioids. Anyone who has tried feel free to tell me your experience with it.

Hello.  I just lost my job due to Covid-19 and I am struggling very hard to  come up with rent and to be able to feed myself and my daughter. I have  an old script of 120 OC oxy 80s I am looking to get rid of to try and  get some rent money together. I am willing to negotiate price and let  them go for relatively cheap because I have a deadline to meet for rent.  Would you or anyone be interested in them? Any help is appreciated. 

I can ship just about anywhere

263,0,I am on kadian daily for my chronic pain. I have a dose I didn’t take one day (1600mg- 16 100mg capsules) they’re in these clear capsules and are these little tiny white balls I think gelatine capsules? That release over time. Can I do something with them to be able to IV and get high? I’m a heroin addict and have a huge tolerance anyways.
264,0,I decided the quarantine is a great opportunity stop using now that I have to be at home and not go to work. I talked to a friend of mine who is planning to do the same. We are both on day one. I wondered if anyone else is take this opportunity?

267,0,Hi Im Male 23 And Im asking that is it possible to snort crushed Tramadol or oxy? Thanks btw. :-)
270,0,"So I use to be a heavy heroin addict from 2010 - 2014. I use to mostly order from the deep web. I usually use to buy Heroin #3 (it's a tan/brown powder that's snortable). Heroin is not the same as it was back in the day. It's all laced with Fentanyl now a days. I'm not an addict now, but I just smoke H or snort very small lines 1-2 a year (I know, unbelievable, but I usually use kratom mostly now a days).


I order from ""onion land"" (Google what it means if you're confused) mostly. I ordered ""Heroin #4"" from a week ago. In the details the vendor claimed he tests his supply for Fentanyl and its anologues to make sure there is none. Since I don't want to die, I tested it with my Fentanyl testing strips and it tested positive. The vendor claimed on his vendor page that he tests his and it's Fentanyl free which pissed me off.


Every single pill or powder you buy, fucking testing it ! Sure you got to buy the strips (I buy Rapid Response Fentanyl Testing Strips online) and it's really reliable and accurate. Even if your best friend or your mom claimed that their batch is Fentanyl free, fucking test it yourself. Don't trust anyone. I had to throw the whole batch away when it tested positive.


Fuck you dealers that do this. Heroin use to be really damn good from 2010 - 2013 before it started getting laced with Fentanyl. Also, lean towards buying black tar and brown powder heroin over white powder. If it says ""china white"", do not buy. That is guaranteed Fentanyl laced 90% of the time."
271,0,I took about 20mg of dilaudid (I have a tolerance) this morning around 11 am. I was looking to maybe cop some more and take it this evening around 8 or 9 so I’m in a good spot before bed. I usually only use at night so I don’t know if it’s safe to take a similar dose or higher in the same day.
272,0,"Around 11am i took 1mg Xanax and then at 3 o’clock took a 10mg perc, am i safe to take another .5mg Xanax now 4 hours after my perc?"

276,0,i've been smoking mexis (pressed fentanyl) off and on for about a month and a half now and i'm starting to not really do it as much and now i'm constantly panicking and i can't sleep and i have restless legs and shit. i don't know if it's withdrawal because i've never experienced symptoms before i'm not vomiting or feverish or anything but i'm just constantly panicking and i need to know if it's the drugs and how to help not freak the fuck out for no reason all day
277,0,"Ive been on oxy for a little over a month almost everyday. Been doing a 20 mg dose in the morning and 12 hours later i do a 10 mg dose and been high and euphoric all month on 30mg. 2 days ago i noticed i didnt get as high so i thought time to up my dose. So i did a 30mg dose to start the day yesterday in the morning, thats a 10mg jump, and still didnt feel much. Today I said fuck it and did a 35 mg dose, 15mg more, and nothing. Time for a break, but does anyone know why that is? Does tolerance jump a whole 20mg+ over the course of 2 days after using a whole ass month?"
278,0,"I've been looking for this shit like a crackhead with my phone's torch for awhile after I quit (It fell off the surface when I was crushing it). Finally found the tiny rock in the most unexpected place under the closet in dust. Felt like a lost piece of me was returned when I found and snorted the shit. Fuck, crushing it and snorting it was so nostalgic. The sweet blissful rush was what I've been missing for so long. It didn't last for long but I felt the sweet rush I've been missing for so long time and now I want to relapse badly but this quarantine bs is making it seem hard and not worth it. 

How is everyone doing with this quarantine? Being sober is super boring and all I can think of is dope."

284,0,"About to land some oxy 40s, they are 100% legit and I’m excited for them. My guy told me that the coating on the pills can be razored off, mouth watered off, or I can just grind them.

285,0,"What is your experience with this ? Is the opiate high the same or different when taken durning a stim comedown?    

Probably better when you transit from comedown to opiate high :) 

My plan is a 20 days tolerance break(I am daily kratom and poppy user), than taking some mdma with my best friend+ a little bit weed after the mdma hits. During the comedown (around 2-3 hours into the comedown) I would take some oxy. What do you think about this ? Should I wait longer, between comedown and taking it ? Is it safe to take it this close ? 

I have never done this before but it sounds like absolut heaven haha"

291,0,"I don’t really know what the point of this post is, but I’ve read and learned a lot from this sub and just wanted to offload somewhere. I’m 20, and I’ve experimented with a lot of drugs in the past five years or so, but have definitely taken to opiates in a different way. I’ve messed around a lot with oxy, both pressed and not pressed, and over the past year I’ve went on a couple of 1-2 week long benders where I would rail pressed 30s every day. This was always regulated by the fact that I didn’t have a reliable or constant connect, so these mini binges would have to come to an end. However, I recently found a spot in my city where I can buy dilaudid for pretty cheap on the street, and I’ve been doing them like 3-4 times a day for the past week. 

I’ve seen several people close to me battle with and lose their lives to heroin addiction, and I know that I have an extremely addictive personality. I’ve very aware of the fact that I am playing a very dangerous game and it’s only a matter of time before it gets serious, but despite this awareness, I almost feel like I’d rather just keep getting high than deal with life sober. My life is probably pretty nice compared to a lot of people in this sub, but when I’m sober I just feel sad/empty and all I can think about is getting high. There’s nobody that really knows that I’ve been using because I don’t have anybody I could talk to who would understand without being overly concerned or sketched out, so I’ve taken to this outlet. I’ve just been sniffing em in my room all day and nobody really notices. 

I’ve even been starting to consider copping h, since dilaudid doesn’t really have legs and I just lost my job so I don’t know how long I can sustain my current habit. I don’t know why my brain works the way it does, and I often wish it doesn’t, but I don’t know how to stop making self destructive decisions even if I’m aware that I’m making them. I feel like I haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole yet, but I’ve been close for years and now I feel I’m at the precipice, but I don’t know how to stop myself. 

Sorry for this all over the place post, and I guess I have a couple of questions:
1) I’m very aware that I have an unhealthy, unsustainable habit, but I have no will or desire to stop it. Any suggestions as to how I can change this?
2) how long does it take to develop physical withdrawals from everyday use of dilaudid?

Thank you for reading this, and I hope everybody is staying safe out there! God bless"

294,0,"Hey guys, went about a month and a half clean of oxycodone and then relapsed and started doing blues again. I went for about a month straight and got up to about 2.5-3 oxy 30s a day. Something clicked yesterday and I decided today I am going to stop again and get clean. The money drain is hurting me financially and it bothers me that I rely on this shit to feel normal, constantly worrying if I’m going to be able to grab again. I did my last quarter last night at 8pm and I know I have some shit withdrawals coming in the next few days-week. I got a small amount of Xanax to help with some sleep and about 4mg of sub to help through the worst of it. That was my recipe last time I went through withdrawals and it def helped. I guess I’m posting here because I am the ONLY one in my life that knows about my issue. I can’t tell my wife or my family because they would never look at me the same.  The hardest part about getting clean is having no help from anyone. I’ve had that inner voice in my head today tell me to go grab about 3 times today but I’ve stayed strong. How do some of you stay strong? Any support is appreciated since I know mostly all of you in this sub knows what I’m going through/ about to go through. Hope everyone is doing well today!"
299,0,"Hey everyone. Due to my current situation and the country I'm in, I cannot get my hands on any opiates. And who knows how long these lockdowns will occur. I've used fent for two years but am clean for the past month. Overall I feel okay but sometimes I get really bad cravings and experience awful anxiety.

The fact that everyone's staying indoors and I can't go outside to do anything makes the situation worse. If I'm able to get suboxone, should I? I would use it every 2 or 3 days probably just to get rid of these awful cravings I have, and to do my best to avoid tolerance. 

Is this an awful idea? Thank you"
300,0,"has anyone actually done this?

my 7 year party is finally over. my dealer can't get product thanks to the virus, and i'm losing everything because i'm out of work.

i have about 500mg of methadone (liquid) that's been sitting in my fridge for a year. i can barely get by on 60mg a day, and another person I need to look out for can handle about 30mg a day.

i've used the search function, there's people talking about doing tapers, but nobody reports back.

**is it worth doing 4-6 days of a methadone taper (60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10mg in my case, then stopping) or doing 3 days of 60mg and then cutting a bit for 3 days?**

**or is it just prolonging dope WD?**

i'm at the end of my rope and need some help, please."
301,0,"Yesterday I tried oxycodone for the first time, I took half a 40mg pill on no tolerance (only used tramadol and subutex a handful of times in the past). I had done a gram of speed the night before and was barely coming down, plus I hadn't eaten in a day, so I'm not surprised I wasn't blown away by it or anything. It felt nice and comfortable, I curled up on my friend's bed and eventually was drifting in and out with pretty vivid daydreams. I think I passed out eventually, and the rest of the day I was really weak, dizzy, cold, and vomiting. 

I still have one pill left, I want to try it again but do it properly this time. So I'm gonna eat a few hours before and make sure I've got other substances out of my system before, but what else and should I try taking a bit more or no? 

I also dunno if I'm expecting too much? I didn't feel euphoric or blissful, or like all my worries were gone which I kinda would like rn... I don't know if the speed just ruined it for me and trying 20mg would work next time or if I should take 30mg or 40mg. I heard that's a lot on no tolerance, but a friend suggested going for it, I just wanted to recheck."

I once shot up xanax mixed with proplyene glycol just to see what would happen.

I shot numerous different types of pills. Oxycodone, methadone, dilaudid, opana. 

I once shot gabapentin in an attempt at trying to get rid of dope sickness. I was very desperate and stupid."

306,0,"I've always bragged that I had never overdosed.

After 8+ years of using, I was pretty confident in my ability to self-control and regulate. I've been in some pretty insane situations, but I always walked away unscathed. Never been arrested. Never cheated or stole to get well. Never had to sacrifice too much of my dignity. Always kept a day job. My family *still* doesn't know I'm a drug addict at all. But beneath the facade, I'm hiding a goddamn monster. Lately, the beast has been working it's way out of it's cage. I've steadily pushing the limits I've set for myself to ""maintain,"" normalcy. First I started grabbing an extra bag here and there, then I started hiding my extra stash from the SO. I picked the needle back up after a 3 year cessation, and it was like riding the bicycle. I started going on runs to the badlands with my middle, who reintroduced me to speed balls. It would be fine if I did it when no one else was around to see. Every once in a while while no one's looking, no harm in it. Then an old friend came back to town. He's in recovery, too. We go to an NA meeting together and reconnect over the course of a few visits. I start to feel this strange, wild, self-deprecating tendency, a desire to be reckless, to do bad things.. My relationship is crumbling, I'm having terrible anxiety at work, I hate my life, the world is going insane.. Fuck it. We start getting high together. I sabotaged the cage I'd built for my monster and now it's just roaming free - In fact, it's thriving. I do another speed ball. And another. And another. One too many on the drive back from the pick-up. While I'm unconscious, the friend floors it to his house. Thankfully he had narcan. It took two to wake me up. Headache. Bad taste. Confusion. My ears rung so loud I couldn't hear my own thoughts. He looked exhausted.. I retraced my memories.. Nothing after pushing the plunger.. Just a sea of blackness. Then sudden, ragged, labored breaths. Headache. Bad taste. Confusion..

I mean while sober I cant trust my hands to not open and drop everything. or sometimes they even shake momentarily, like a spasm, and send everything flying. I spill every drink. always knock over what I'm trying to grab. just generally 1000 times more clumsy.  and I cant think of another explanation than my heroin use. anyone else experience something similar?"

332,0,"My dude was out of the blues (30s) so I got the 10s he had instead. He says ppl like the 10s more actually. Problem is, they are 5 times larger than the 30s - kinda like a perc, so lots of binders. They are yellow with 230 on one side and a symbol of (brand?) on the other. No doubt they’re pressed. My question is... how do you go about filtering to bang pills of that size? I crushed up two and added 100 units of water and it was just a mushy mess. So I added about another 50ccs and made it liquid enough to soak into some cotton and extract the liquid. Clogged up the needle so I removed it and drew up needless. Then refiltered that solution through a new cotton and used that. I lost some so I assume I got about 15mg worth and didn’t really feel much, at least not compared to what I would feel from half a 30. I understand opiates are soluble in water so theoretically the water I drew out should have all the good stuff and the mush left behind is fillers. I’m going to consume the leftovers orally a bit later and see what happens. I imagine the size would make these u desire able to sniff too... or smoke (gross anyway for pills). What’s my best option here? CWE like vics? Mind you I have no way of knowing exactly what kind of opiates are in here. I always assumed the pressed are some combo of morphine and fent... I wonder if these are actually just percs...."
333,0,Is it true that if I split a 80mg sandoz oxy in half and only take half it will still be like taking the full 80mg. Someone told me this is true and that you can’t split a sandoz extended release as it will just activate all of it on one side. Someone please let me know if this is true or false. Cause I have some 80s and don’t want to take the full 80mg I want to do like 40mg. Thanks
334,0,"He seems absolutely miserable and is writhing in pain, in and out of consciousness, and is sleeping in the shower on and off. 

He's taken 28mg suboxone today. Shouldn't this be enough for even a strong habit? Should he keep taking more? He's also going to take 1,200mg gabapentin. 

I'm watching him for now. what point should I be concerned or seek professional help for him? 

If he gets fentanyl again, how dangerous is it for him to combine it with the subutex? He uses counterfeit m30s that are pure fent."

But when I try to sleep at night I get this weird feeling when I lay down where I’m super restless and twitchy and feel extreme vertigo. Like I’m really tired and can’t keep my eyes open but can’t get relax to fall asleep. The only way I’ve been able to get to sleep is Xanax but I only have so many in my prescription and I don’t want to use them all. Is what I’m feeling withdraws?? Are there any other ways you’ve found to be able to sleep?

I tried

346,0,I snorted some 30mg oxy and i’m just curious as to why it’s hard to swallow sometimes? It’s usually the case pretty much every time i do them when drinking water or even just trying to swallow my spit or any food. Doesn’t hurt or anything it’s just like the muscle used to swallow food just stops working. is this a common side effect for other people? i do them all the time ive just never thought to find out if that’s one of the side effects of it or if i’m just weird lol
347,0,"I was just curious how different the highs between these two drugs feel. I always hear peoppe say oxy is synthetic heroin and I'm aware they are chemically very similar. However if you take comparable doses is heroin way stronger, is it more sedating... etc?"

I am aware of the seizure risk associated with Tramadol, which is another reason I am playing it safe and waiting as long as possible.

If it makes a difference, it was vet bupe, and I tried to let it absorb under my tongue but only left it there for 5 minutes so it might not have fully dissolved."
349,0,"Hi guys and gals, hope all of you are fine and at least well or much better High like me. I have been clean 65 days now, I slipped up last month and had a planned relapse of 4 days but except that I didnt used any drugs, I even dont smoke weed anymore but thats just cause smoking alone sucks and most of my friends dont smoke weed or do any other drugs. That was also a important step to cut out the friends who use and for real these guys never were real friends we just hung out if someone needed help to get dope or money. I currently got a system I just use for 2-4 days a month then my thirst for opioids is good. The rest of the month I just drink on weekends with my real friends. Drinking was never a big problem for me. I already snorted about .3-.5g I think. Also my 2g baggy got a bit of overweight it were 2.4g which is awesome. I am very talkactive and the dope is super strong so that amount I snorted got me buzzing and nodding pretty hard. Alsp I am super talkactive and I came out of a depression which I had for the last 3 weeks and I got the Energy to write again on my book. I also got a quick question what do you guys do to stop the itching and nauseas? My whole face is read from scratching and my balls are also super itchy. Maybe someone got a tipp for me, oh and I cant go to a pharmacy because of the quarantine in my country and also our pharmacys here are just open from monday- saturday and on the weekends are just one pharmacy open if you need something for a emergency and I currently cant drive because of my Epilepsie. So maybe someone would like to talk a bit with me, you can answer here or PM/DM me. Thanks for reading guys and if you got a quick tipp for the itching and nauseas I would be very thankful. Have a nice day/evening fam. Stay safe."

I’m in the process of doing a rapid sub taper today, I’ll be sticking to kratom and leftover rx benzos and whatnot since I am deathly afraid of getting a condition due to needles that would force me to go expose myself to the Shanghai sneeze. 


In the interest of that point, are there good home remedies or activities I should be doing to prevent this from turning into something worse?

Okay so, basically I need to know a ballpark figure of how many of  you fellow H users will be absolutely in desperate need or highly wanting to see a picture of my stash  of BLD/BLP. 
I’ve got lots but I’ll probably take one more and can post a pic or send it over message . Once again . HOW MANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A FREE OF CHARGE NICE PIC OF MY BLACK LABRADOR PUPPY/DOGGY? 

To be more accurate he is a monster sized great big black Labrador but I have to call him my black Labrador puppy because he is the one of a kind giant puppy who never grows into a doggy, he was abused by my very old and unable to care for themselves let alone this dog I’d trade my life for his safety, bc of this he had been robbed of his puppy time and it was beyond obvious that he was asking/ in desperate need of being treated as a PUPPY and not a dog, he is extremely needy, very extreme cute but he never understood why they were so rude to him and they prob hit him or threw shot at him and kept him in hot cars while they did shit like went to movies etc, had to show him for a very long time that I do not ever and will not ever hurt him as he is a real baby, always scared until he understood he is my precious precious item and he does literally demand a very heavy puppy treatment. He will not sleep unless you human style hold him and rub his tum tum to sleep, HE WILL NOT EVER EVER EVER LEAVE THE HOUSE TO WALK ETC WITH OUT ONE OF FOUR STUFFED DUCKYS, HE FAVORITES HIS STUFFY DUCKYS BUT RARELY MAKES SURE TO INCLUDE ALL STUFFY FRIENDS AS MAYBE HE FOES NOT WANT ANY TO  FEEL LEFT OUT like he was.... you may get lucky and he will deem you special enough to personally introduce you to mostly blue ducky, that’s his go to ducky. SmAll grey ducky seems to be the baby of his ducky family, he’s gentle and does not rip baby grey ducky up, two gray green ducky’s seem to be a good friend but he’s rough with his grey green ducky brothers and may be bc he knows he’s got two, other stuffy friends are loved but I am not sure why he is very clearly preferred of his ducky buddy’s. Odd, one has a total diff shape and looks like a diff ducky but he still knows and favors highly.   If you’d like I may. Give a pic with entire ducky friend family, I am soon to give him a plethora of ducky’s but oh guys I had to go he’s lookin right at me he woke up and he is seemingly annoyed why lights on we aren’t in sleepy position, update he just migrated to the pillows could be a power move.  I will remain in close contact as he fell in the pool at 3 am two nights ago and panicked and waited for me to remedy the situation instead of going to the steps. Do not worry he will not get to possible pool danger zone alone and there is also an important point that is don’t worry about what if he has to pee or poop, he got this 8-10 am get up annoy until human is Conscious and then big yawn , daddy pee pee whine and that’s a wrap, I am going to grab fallen ducky as sleepy big puppy has allowed green gray ducky to tumble off onto a pillow, he is aware and looked at me and back at ducky, I take this as a “hey daddy I don’t know if you saw but ducky go fall fall... hey daddy use ur long arms to get ducky duck I wanna get ducky..
Update he stopped staring at me which is odd must be tired as he is usually very concerned about ducky falling but seems to be tired, no fear I get the duck and place the duck by his head. Look guys I know this might not be the best place but black tar doggy he’s got the black fur super shiny and he’s kind of important among the stuffy ducky community, it is evident he is very much so responsible to the proper care and walking of each ducky and also his torn up doggy, and lots of small toys, also advice, out of no where he’s now twice recently shown very so spoiled behavior And Eatan a big chicken breast that he was not told was actually being cooked for him, no harm no foul but I used a surprised upset face and a “shady! Did you just steal your own big boy chicken yum yum? That’s not cool to do bro, but I am not good with this and I started tum tum rubby time so he might thinks “fuck it I get ttrt right after I did a big wolf hunt attack on a wild grilled chicken breast” not sure but he consumed the one meant for him  not mine, pure luck.   Here’s where it gets serious and dangerous and I do not play here, shady managed to attack a real actual wild cooked rotisserie chicken and eaten it’s entire mean and bones of one side, this was not at all for big labby dog and punishment was needed, I put him in the big dog bed, but he takes control and moves to tiny dog bed for other small dog, eh it had more toys atm but a possible cute power move As I’m sure he is well aware his cute attacks very well disarm my upcoming power punishment, he might know that his cute power move prevents me from using the paintball gun on him? Just kidding I would fucking never, but in all seriousness I can’t physically punish him I would rather hit a real baby, try me I’ll fuckin do it , these hands are not rated P for puppies but they could be a B for babies as humans can take care of themselves I do not see much care for babies atleast now, my baby? Maybe in future but  as of now my biggest responsibilities are to do all my life stuff but only after a proficient 250% care has been provided about ten times over for my big shady black fur puppy boy and he’s very big.

393,0,"I was at the house with my best friend. Our other friend was at a hotel 3 mins away with a dopehoe he's messing with that just has a bad attitdue. me and my friend get a bad Vibe from her.

I had just met this new friend like 3 days ago, he has some of the worst back problems I've ever seen, his spine is so fucked up it sticks out of his back. Like some of the worst scoliosis ive ever seen. Yet still an incredible positive nice guy who keeps his head up and smiles, just a dude you wanna help out. I had kinda bonded with him today and I had messaged him like two hours before this and told him anything he needed to hit me up, if he needed a place to crash, anything.

We're sitting there, we get a call
""NARCAN!!"". My friend screaming call the paramedics, he hangs up the phone and we scramble to get the keys, I grab two smokes and we head to his car and gun it. I kept asking my friend to park his car far away and hide his shit, that the chick had warrents, while he calmly called 911 and told them exactly what he needed to.

We get to the hotel, the chick had threw him in the shower, never called the paramedics, stole all the drugs, and left. He was coming too, thank God, since it was obvious fent dope. 

I've never been around when the paramedics and cops come to an od, but they took his pulse, it was fine, said he should go to the er (no thanks corona), cops asked him his name, if we had any other drugs, and left. No one searched the room or asked our names or anything. Super calm and routine feeling.

After telling someone I had their back... I was worried about getting arrested etc.. I cried once we realized he was okay, one bit too much and he'd be dead cuz of her. A good soul, gone because of selfishness.
I gained so much respect for my friend who handled the situation like an expert. If I had got that call and he had done a bit more, he might be dead.

I'm buying narcan which j never have because I'm on done, but now I know I should have ir. And so should you. And now I know exactly what to do, so I'm glad about that but ashamed about how I panicked. I can't say I'm shocked about the girl... These chemicals steal your soul."

398,0," I've been doing opiates for many years now, my favourite rn is heroin, partly because of its price, partly cos of its strength.

Can't remember being clean for more then 5 days either, Oxys I would do up 150mg at a time. 

 Now back to my question, everyone with similar tolerance (which I'm only assuming is similar) would say that codeine does fuck all to them, except ""hardly"" keeping them from withdtawals.
And I do believe that. What's interesting is that I still get high on codeine as on all other opiates. Obviously I will need at least 0.5g to get high, 1g+ and I'm noding my face off. 

 I realize how it works, that it's a pro-drug and it depends on an individual, how well it's converted into morphine by ones liver, so is my liver just so fucking good in doing the thing? Or are there more people like me?"

A lot of doctors have said it is a good drug and that it should have never been banned. Am I the only person who misses it? I haven't had any since they were banned. There is just something about Darvocet and my body chemistry that made me enjoy it. I like other opiates, but I had a special relationship with dextropropoxyphene that I don't with any other drug.

418,0,"So the stuff I’ve been getting lately has been distasteful to be polite about it. All the shit on every block where I go it’s pretty much the same shit it’s getting old to be honest.

The problem is everything is cut with tranquilizers not sure what kind and the people cutting it probably don’t either. I intentionally buy fentanyl by the bag or bun now the question;

Can I cook the tranq out of the fentanyl without everything just evaporating or just in general ruining the batch ?"

420,0,"Guys, 

my experiment so far has worked. Everyone knows DXM is known to prevent tolerance from increasing. So does agmatine sulfate, a healthy more natural way that gets the NDMA receptors working to prevent tolerance increasing of opiates.

So I took a week off, went through withdrawals to lower my tolerance some. Ok, so now my tolerance is from 70 mg oxy per dose down to 45 mg per dose. Now, my experiment is to see if agmatine sulfate, which works very similar to DXM in regards to tolerance, can prevent my tolerance from increasing.

Usually, when I take a tolerance break and resume use, on day 3 of using my tolerance spikes considerably. Today is day 3 of my using again, with agmatine sulfate 1 gram 45 minutes before each dose. And my dose is still at 45 mg of oxy, I don't need any more to get high! Holy shit it seems like its working.

Anyways, I'm just really excited about this so I wanted to make a post and share. Maybe someone else has tried tolerance prevention with agmatine? It's only day 3, so I'll give more updates as time goes on."

486,0,"Long story short, I've lived in chronic pain for almost a decade now and I started dabbling in opiates a few years ago. It began with 30mg of codeine a couple times per week, and has blasted off to being 100mg morphine + 20 grams of kratom most days of the week, steadily increasing. The worst part is that I'm still in pain, but need this dependency to not feel totally in agony daily. I've noticed my standard for what feels ""normal"" changing, since I know that if I just keep taking opioids, then things can be that much better. I used to be able to take 3-4 day breaks (during which I use gabapentin/lyrica + baclofen instead), but now it's so deeply ingrained into me and I'm so afraid of withdrawal that I just keep the ball rolling. I never thought this would happen to me. I thought I had good self discipline. Now I feel totally awash in and enslaved by opioids from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep.

I'm not sure what scares me more, the fact that I'm getting balls deep into opiate dependency, or the fact that my health has gotten so bad as to (feel like?) I need it. Of course there's the physical pain, but then there's the sense of dread and hopelessness in my health that is fueling this habit.

I'm not sure what to expect from posting this, but perhaps some support at least. Perhaps some tips for taking breaks or limiting dosage. Perhaps some anecdotes to inspire or deter me from getting even deeper. Hell, maybe even some encouragement that what I'm doing is justified. I don't know... I just need to get this out."

So I had to go home until this Monday when I go to the 28 day program.  My question is if I just used for 1 day I was wondering I would be okay to take a strip since I already detoxed. I just don't want to be thrown into precipitated withdrawl. And I would rather take a strip to try to keep myself from wanting to do H and start having withdrawals again between now and the day I leave for rehab."

I just dont know how to go about it, because I'm never in enough pain to really explain how I feel so I always say it's not that bad, but really my pain keeps me from living the quality life I want, and opiates are the only medication that helps and I enjoy using them, I can control my use and even take breaks..jabber jaws..

To the people here who are prescribed opioids.

How did it all go leading up to the doc writing the script?

497,0,"Hey, just registered because I am a big fan of the whole opioid game on reddit. Just wanted to share a story, helped some friends of mine

I was on 800mg of morphine every day for 5 years. Prescription drug for opioid addiction. Snorted it as long as it seemed to be a viable option, but got too much work someday extracting it from the slow release capsules...wasnt getting high anymore anyway and starting to shoot up was not an option. Already converted it to morphine base to smoke it, used them particular fruit extracts to inhibit that encyme (be aware that that's no game, if you are abusing to full on nodding this could kill you if you're not starting slowly), it ended the same every time: tolerance got higher, and I was lost again. I had a good reason for searching relief, but I am sure we all do

So, I stopped the abusive style, took it orally as prescribed. What should I say, that really helped. The cravings are exponentially related to how fast shit hits the fan (or the opioids hit the brain). (shooting and smoking are the worst, snorting is pretty bad, orally is somewhat better - there is scientific research on this topic). Felt a bit sick because obviously the bioavailability is lower, and I had seasoned my receptors with everything i could find at that time: fenta, heroin, oxys, poppy tea,...but wasn't really that bad and after some days all was well

So I really needed to get my shit together. Had some health issues doctors wouldn't help me with when they knew I was an addict (there are some conditions which are hard to diagnose, and my normal blood work stayed in perfect homeostasis the whole time), significant life changes, and I totally lost control of anything significant. My living conditions were a mess, I haven't let anyone in for years, hadn't loved for years....I really don't know if I ever had.

Anyways, cold turkey from 800mgs sometimes gets a bit fucking stressful, seriously was thinking about killing myself to not have to go through that. But I have major depression since I am a child, so that's probably completely normal for me. So I tapered it. TAPERING! So much underappreciated.

At first I could cut a third with no big issues. Later got slower, over the course of 6 months. Stopped when I wanted to, sometimes even did a bit more again just to taper again the following days. Sometimes I combined it with waiting for withdrawal (the more or less nice beginning of it, when you start crying because the music hits so deep after you were to numb for a decade to even really appreciate it), just to stop it with a little lower dose again. This would have been unthinkable of when I used the faster routes of consumption. It really wasn't bad. I had so much dope at home, still didn't touch it. It needed some time to get used to consume orally, but was the best idea I've had that year. The last steps were 60mg, 45mg, 30mg, and then about 15mg. Was working my full time job the whole time and even was happy at that time. For going 0, I've took a week of. But in retrospect, that wasn't even necessary...i felt a bit sick, but happy and very motivated. And I didn't use any tool to kill withdrawal, no Benzos or alcohol or anything else.

This was easy compared to what happened afterwards. I'm still not sure if this story is going to have a happy end, but I wanted to share it to show that cold turkey isn't the way to go, and that kicking the habit, even from totally insane doses, is totally possible without too much discomfort.
So yeah, I still had loads of dope at home. Wasn't an issue at first, withdrawal was long gone and I didn't have cravings. But later my condition was worsening, was in really bad pain, couldn't sleep,...and that's not even close to the worse symptoms. English isn't my mother tongue so I really don't know how to describe theese excruciating states of body and mind. So bet you know what followed, some time later. I totally relapsed, full on addict again. Didn't take me long to blow up 600 my nose again, and still didn't really feel it. When my stack was gone, I had to learn what real suffering is. This time, no tapering, no control, no help. Alone. Paired with the painful condition I was running from. There were some tries made to ease the pain, still found some junk from the extractions from years ago. Did a little junk chemistry to get the last bits out, which worked better than expected. So I had about 1g of them sweet morphine to taper, right? Blew it up in one day. ""just one more day. One more day of bliss"", my fucked up brain was thinking....then came about 14 days of one of the worst experiences I've ever had. The beginning was nice, as eberytime. Felt again, cried like a little boy because everything was so intense. Then, only pain driving me insane, and absolute insomnia, so you have more time to enjoy the suffering. The suicidal thoughts felt way more real than ever - just take the gun and press, and the pain is gone. You are a failure, everyone hates you, and you don't deserve this life. JUST FUCKING DO IT! - my brain was screaming 24/7. I couldn't take it anymore. Started drinking much alcohol, got so intoxicated that I've had blackouts. Had to be really careful to drink something non alcoholic, as dehydration was getting scaryly dangerous now. Hadn't eaten anything in days. I Still had a dog I had to care for, I still have no idea how I could manage that...but I love my doggo

It's getting better now, still fucked tho. Seems like PAWS is an issue with opioids when quitting cold turkey from high doses. The suicidal screaming is pretty quiet now, I've been somewhat productive the last days. Still a failure, but getting better. Been happy sometimes, and I love beeing able to feel again. Been a zombie for too long. Was crying last night, when listening to ""badflower - ghost"" - ""I died as the ghost, of the man I was meant to be""


Anyways, TLDR is: tapering fucking rules. If you can support your daily habit you can support a tapering habit. And cold turkey is not a good idea. This suffering is not necessary nor good

Stay safe and positive. Even the most hurt and lost people can find their path again. I have seen it so many times. I hope I will too

Hope everything is clear, English is not my mother tongue but I think I got somewhat advanced in it"
498,0,"So I’ve recently started on Methadone. I’ve got 30 days clean today so I now get my Saturdays and Sundays taken home which is awesome. 

The clinic I go to uses pills instead of liquid methadone though. They use the orange wafers and they drop your dose into a little plastic cup and squirt a tiny amount of water on it and then outside the window there’s a little thermos with Tang that’s super concentrated to mask the taste of the pill. 

I’ve come to the realization that when you get to the point of getting a whole week of take homes up to a whole month they stop adding a little water and bottling each dose individually and they just put the pills in a pill bottle which I think is awesome. I’m really really looking forward to getting whole month take homes because I’m going to keep getting my 110 mg but greatly reduce my dose so I have a large stockpile for any event of something bad happening. 

My question is is it normal for clinics to use the orange pills like this? I had only ever heard of them using liquid. It’s my first time going to a clinic so I’m not very experienced with it. 

Tbh I love the clinic. It’s only 10$ a day. I get drug tested once a month. And I’ve never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get dosed. Normally I don’t have to wait at all and they call my number as soon as I check in. I was reading reviews of other clinics in the area and where I used to live and there’s some terrible reviews lol"

Though never without a sense of impend.  

  



Because we both in identical loath,  


Cycled our days like we'd sworn an oath.  


He nodded on heroin, I danced with speed;  


Little did we know, just in the end how  


Oh how we'd cut and bleed...  

  



Because loving him dopesick tore me apart;  


I cried out that ""please, let's both just restart!""  


A life exists beyond that sweet, sweet hell...  


I was so happy when he hesitantly glanced out that prison cell.  

  



It was goodbye to heroin, as in whelmed the rush;  


All the emotions he'd always tried to kill and crush.  


I stood by his side, called around the clock,  


But at the back of my head I heard a sly knock.  

  



The oldest friend of them all, it was back.  


It was speed, my need, reminding me that it had never left;  


""He'll never own your heart because that's called theft"".  


He definitely knew, even through his chills and aches and cries,  


That I had always been chained with these rusty iron ties.  

  



We both tried so hard to win,  


It was me and him versus speed and heroin.  


Surely these substances couldn't throw it all to the bin?  

  



But all it took  


Was speed's sneaky little hook;  


During a moment a little too weak...  


Our castle of glass now bared a creak,  


And in could our ending leak.  

  



Before I surrendered to my binding death kiss,  


I thought of things far worthier than this.  


But then, I felt it, oh GOD there was the pain,  


From I couldn't hide, no pretense to feign.  


  


I was hurting, I was hurting,  


And maybe selfish, that too.  


With speed prowling and flirting,  


""Take me"", my lips were finally blurting.  

  



I remembered the pain,   


The violence and the rain.  


Starting from six or seven years old,  


My sister and I were held in that boiler room cold.  


It was just my mom's punishment, no food nor light.  


We'd take turns sitting on the only chair, surrendered to the fight.  


We'd tell each other happy stories to keep us running sane,  


But never before beating the locked doors until our wrists would sprain.  


If I strayed there now, what would I find again?  


Tiny nail marks and a faded bloodstain.  

  



And I remember the vain  


Of begging to please stop;  


For their hands on my private parts to tire and drop.  


After twelve I switched to pants, uniform skirts claimed I disliked,  


The other girls just laughed and called me a dyke.  


I've never hugged my parents since;  


Never kissed without a sob or wince;  


Never felt pure... no matter how I'd scrub and rinse.  

  



More memories pouring in...  


Oh there's no way that I can win...  


The helplessness of seeing my anorexic sister wilting to death;  


Couldn't clear the sound of my friend's gurgling bloodied breath.  


I remember screaming and crying when he took off his pants... We'd met only twice, I think his name was Seth?  

  



Today, I found a needle deep in my arm.  

  



And for a moment   


There was   


A feeling of faint...  


But quickly there was no regret, no alarm, no harm.  


I had pushed that poet to fight his hellish battle,  


But forgotten for my own weapons to disarm.  

  



When I told him, he did not accept;  


He burst with anger, a promise I had not kept.  


Like a long lost lover heroin reeled him back,  


Twelve hours later, dry were his tears as he smoked that victorious smack.  

  



As I shamefully look at the bruises on my arm,  


A new voice coos to me with whispery charm:  


""This was your downfall, your fight is inept...  


So give me a chance and the pain is finally swept.  


You already know that your friend I have kept;   


Choose me and you won't remember why you've ever even wept.""  

  

( Also reposted on r/opiates but I thought someone here might like it too. I just wanted to share this even though it's kinda scary sharing something *so* personal. Almost all the details in it are true, I have a friend I was helping off heroin but I recently made the mistake to start to IV and my life has spiraled since. A friend is getting me heroin next week, I'm very new to the world of opiates but I crave that thought of all the pain being gone. Just to clarify, the incorrect details are that I'm not actually sure if my friend has relapsed yet or not, and the guy who tried to rape me (I got away!) wasn't named Seth, did it for the rhyme. Also, my sister did almost die but she survived anorexia :)



And to clarify, the boiler room stuff is just how my mom would punish me as a kid, it really messed things up for me. And the childhood sexual abuse was true to the last detail. But I guess it's okay now. I worked hard on this poem so I hope someone enjoys it, thanks all. It's really hard to help someone through addiction when you suck at handling your own shit (I don't really consider myself addicted, but still. Idk. I just don't know with anything anymore) )"

26,0,"The local drug court where I live has stopped giving random tests and requiring it's participants to report in. I'm not on drug court, but a friend(and ex fuck buddy of mine) is. It's really none of my business, but I'm just gonna post a paranoid rant here to see if anyone can talk some sense into me. 

I recently relapsed about two weeks ago, after seven months of sobriety(another story/excuse). It is what it is. Her (I will call her ""L"") and I had been attending Celebrate Recovery meetings together, and there had been some flirtation involved. It has escelated GREATLY on both of our parts since she was laid off her job due to the virus.  I did not tell her I had relapsed until two days ago, and have only been around her once since my relapse to give her vehicle a jump start.

I confessed to her, and she was, unexpectedly, not judgemental at all, and has continued the flirty texts. I have very much enjoyed this. She currently thinks that I am trying to get off of it, but probably can tell by the things I say in text, that I'm still using. 

She has not been texting me during the day AT ALL, not even seeing my messages, during the day(whether on purpose or not....using Facebook messenger lol.). She starts texting how bad she wants my cock, various fantasies, etc  around 6 or 7 pm the past few days, wanting me to come pick her up or sneak in her window. She lives with her mom, who is very fond of me. When I ask if we can meet during the day, she starts ghosting me. Lol. I think I just figured it out haha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I've been trying to keep my distance from her due to the fact that she's on drug court and I don't want to be a bad influence or contribute to her demise. Another, probably bigger reason for not going at night, is I can't get my dick hard on meth. It sucks, and has caused many embarassing moments with females in the past🐢🐢🐢 which I'm VERY scarred from(shrinkage also ugh....).

This behavior that she is exhibiting reminds me very much of the way she would act when we were doing our thing back in late 2017. She would ghost me until she got horny, I would come to her house(she was living alone back then, and selling dope also), we would get high, go fishing at night, do tweaker stuff, etc....then when the time came to have sex I would get very terrified of her seeing my shrunken dope dick...ugh
...and eat her out for literally HOURS(I think 6 was the longest, taking breaks here and there). I really enjoyed this. We did fuck a handful of times l, which was amaZing as well. 

around eight 4, she would always come up with some crazy reason to kick me out, gaslighting me in a bunch of tweaker mind games,. hell it could have been my fault really because we were both probably in psychosis by this point. But that's the past. 

I have a feeling she is using this same routine with a bunch of other dudes and it's one of them turns her down she'll just go to the next one. I have no proof phone this other than the fact that if I was a female doing this stuff, I would be doing that. 

I really don't care that much whether she's doing this or not, I just wanted to post this to document this time in my life as part of a journal type thing so I can look back at it during a future sobriety period .....

I would very much appreciate any one's thoughts or opinions on this. I hope it all makes sense. I made sure to use paragraphs and punctuation as best I could. I've seen other posts and peoples responses lol. Funny shit.

31,0,"TLDR: 
Pros: Motivates someone who isn't able to themselves, treats my add, anxiety and depression, 
Cons: quicker to rage in specific but less likely to get mad in most situations, more cluttered but i clean multiple times a week still, relationship with Borderline personality disorder gets very out of control (still did without the meth but it just makes me stand up for myself more)


meth pros 

motivates someone who it's sufficiently mentally setback from severe add + growing up on adderall to pursue their only passion they have ever seen results in and only one they have ever felt like it comes naturally to them when they felt everything they ever gave done us just mediocre 

gives me the confidence to know i can achieve my goals and im not a loser who cant do anything right due to diagnosed anxiety and depression 

only thing iv ever done that actually gets me to do the things ill otherwise just lay around thinking that would be cool if i could actually do it 

as someone with add depression self hatred and a completely lack of motivation it treats all of those symptoms fantastically 

meth cons 

i get a lot more mad when people do things i consistently ask them not to like break into a rage i dont get physical FIRST but once someone swings ill push them hard and if necessary to avoid further escalation of conflict ill chokehold them until i know they wont retaliate once i let them breath

i am more cluttered, not messy i'll pick uo snd throw away food but i dont out things in the proper place and every week sometimes 2-3 days ill clean everything up and sort everything but for the days its not clean it's almost embarrassing 

relationship with girlfriend has gotten significantly worse because of her bpd and my anger issues so when she asks me to do something and i do it incorrectly and she blows up so do i or shell get livid to the point of the neighbors down the street hearing ut because i wont sleep with her every night (which i do 3-4 days of the week, and because of her bpd if she doesn't get exactly what she wants she starts big extremely over exaggerated issues and now that im doing meth i dont just sit snd take them anymore i try to distance myself from her until she calms doen but she wont ler me have my time to relax and talk about it later she follows me room to room and takes videos of our arguments and when the room is messy like she's trying to show people or embarrass me and ill ask her to please leave and she wont and just say ok but wont leave and i get madder and madder until i try to close the door but she wont let me so ill try to guide her out of the room (not push just move her like a nudge or a mom moving their kid forward) but shell turn around and swing at me and scream ""dont fucking touch me i swear to god if you touch me im gona beat the shit out of you with  a hammer) something she actually said today and than ill start yelling just leave you cant do this to ne in my house and shell refuse and ill just yall more and more because she keeps refusing to leave my house or even my room snd than someone has to intervine snd it seems like im ghe monster because im the ine yelling when they dont see what she does because she's quite with her toxicity"

(He ordered me the shard in advance with me promising I'd pay him once my BTC became available.) Of course I became skeptical as the days passed and the goddamn package didn't arrive and so ordered my own g yesterday and allegedly have 2 g's coming and have apologized to him for my abhorrent addict-level behavior of stereotypical predictability. I've told him assuming both of them show up, I'll send him one of them.

I can't tell if this occasionally unshakeable feeling that I'm fucked in the ass on a universal level and I will not be getting either of them even though there's absolutely no logic or evidence to indicate that. It's probably just an unquenchable need and craving for meth coupled to the fear of how shitty it will be if none of it comes. Anyone have any consolation for a grown adult stuck in the petulantly childish mindset that it's not fair and the only thing my mind is fixated on is that the only thing that matters and my very mental stability is contingent upon is getting my meth mail.

42,0," Hello everyone, i hope this post will not be removed this time :-), so here's the situation:

When preparing to boof some ritalin IR, i put them in water and waited a bunch.

Now the solution has **2 parts:**

1. almost clear water (slightly 'grey-ish')
2. white powder on the bottom of the glass

**Now my question is** \-&gt; *What part should i boof?*

1. the water? (seems too 'clear' to have active substance in it i think)
2. the powder at the bottom? (seems logical to me as this 'looks more like drugs')

I know it may seem a really stupid question and i know some people don't understand \*why ritalin or why boofing,but that's not the point rn :-) I just want to know where's the active part of the solution so i can get buzzin'

I have tried physiotherapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, etc.

I have 30 of these bad boys (20mg IR) so I suppose I’ll mess around with it, but that seems like a good amount for a day without feeling zoomy."
112,0,"Hey guys! My girlfriend's drugs of choice are stims, so we've been doing that for together time since we've been together (not like fiending on it, a gram a night of something once a month tops). When we first started I only did amph twice in my life and molly a couple times.

Since then we've done amph, molly, mephedrone and recently meth. My problem is, the more I do it, the less I feel. Mostly we had been doing amph, and I had started to get less and less stimulated every time, to the point where I would feel no stim at all. All I would get is side effects, stim dick, heartrate up, blood pressure down, etc, and on the upside barely the ability to not fall asleep. At least a month between each time, every time no longer than a night (two days + night between them), mind you. 

We thought that maybe it's just shit stuff we're getting, so we got some pretty fire meth recently. We did that and she said it was the best stim in her life (and she has loads of past experience) while I felt pretty much no stim at all. I had a pretty easy time not falling asleep, but nothing besides that, not even much of a sex drive increase.

Sounds like a tolerance problem, but I don't think I could have built up a tolerance with month+ long breaks inbetween. Now we stocked up on some new meth to hopefully last us through quarantine, and she says it's not as fire but still great.

I don't feel shit on this either. I'm thinking of just not doing it if I don't need to last a whole night through, so as not to waste it. But I hate missing out, the first times I did stims it was pretty fun and I kind of miss it, the head rush and the energy and all that fun stuff. Wouldn't miss it if I didn't do them, but I do and it doesn't work, so that feels like bullshit.

Have you ever heard of a similar situation? What could possibly be a cause or a solution to this? Thank you guys! Stay home and stay safe. ❤"

119,0,"I hate that I love doing crystal meth, and I keep telling myself that a 2 week binge doesnt mean I’m addicted again. Let’s test that theory!

So every single day for about 11 days, I’ve been smoking meth. A little background, I’m a previous meth addict who recently went to co-occuring substance use and mental health issue treatment, which was a short stay at a behavioral hospital followed by 180 day court ordered commitment to an inpatient facility. Upon release, I managed to stay sober for a little less than 2 months, before an Adderall binge. Managed to stay clean for, I don't know, maybe 5 or 6 days? (I have a really poor sense of time)

I try to excuse my drug use with ’I'm not addicted again, I could quit anytime I wanted too. In fact, I'm going to quit as soon as this bag runs out.’ 

But that's such an addict thing to say. Denial, justification, rinse, repeat. I know I’m severely lacking in the self-control department, especially as I’m only 17 and my frontal lobe still hasn't fully developed, which drug use will only continue to hinder and perhaps even deteriorate brain growth. 

So, to test my will-power, physical dependence, and just resilience in general, I will be ceasing use. The last time I took a hit was around 3 AM, so it's been about 5 hours. This will be hard though, because I'm not gonna throw away my bag, or destroy my pipe. I'm gonna leave it, so that it's tempting as hell and if I'm weak enough to want to give in, that will be an option. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to last. My goal is that I will be able to go all day without a single hit, and then tonight get a good night of sleep (I didn’t sleep at all last night, I stayed up watching the entire Tiger King series on Netflix) and then go through the withdrawals like a goddamn champ and get some clean time under my belt. 

Send me some inspiration to keep me going, this will be very hard for me but I intend to keep myself very busy today with writing, exercise and crafts so I'm very hopeful."
120,0,"So I just got out of jail, I was down for 6 months. Not too long but long enough. So my girlfriend when I went in was in recovery, we had both been clean for about a year. She started off strong, writing letters and coming to visit, and handling her business while I was away. Well then something happened three weeks ago, and she had a relapse. She has been at the door house now for five days straight, which is since I got out. So when I got to our apartments he totally blew me off, and was clearly thwacked to the gills, but wouldn’t admit to using. So I didn’t argue, and let her spin me an astonishingly transparent story about why she would be gone for the next few days, and she walked out the door. After she left I started poking around, and found a bent spoon with a piece of cotton in it and a small jar of bleach. So I have zero doubt that she is on the needle whether she admits it or not. Now, I plan to stick it out with her and see if things can turn around (although I am not overly optimistic, she went full force back into the lifestyle) So here’s where I did a thing. For me, speed was never an all consuming demon he way it is for some folks. For me alcohol is my kryptonite, and I therefore absolutely will not drink but I smoke a bubble here and there. Now my concern is that if she is on the needle but doesn’t want to admit it, being ashamed or afraid of how I will react, she is apt to get a disease she will have to live with for the rest of her life. So I went down to the nearest Walmart and bought her 100 disposable sterile syringes, and left them where I knew she would see them without having to say she was going to use them. I told her to give them to one of her friends if she didn’t want them. Harm reduction is something I believe in very strongly, and while the goal will always be to get her back to clean and sober, while we are working on that I want her to be as safe as she can, and the easiest way to avoid disease is to use each point once and toss it out, if your friend needs one he or she can have a fresh one every time too. But here’s where I did a thing. I got curious, I had a couple grams and a hundred points, so I figured why not? It can’t be that different. So I mixed up about .15 in the bucket and injected it. I’m lucky in that my veins are HUGE so I hit it on the first try, and damn was I wrong. It is indeed different. I don’t want to glorify it to anyone who hasn’t done it, if you haven’t done it don’t. But I did and man now I see why she has such a hard time staying away from the needle. It’s instant, and extremely powerful. So yeah. I did a thing, I’m gonna try not to do it again but I probably will, at least once or twice more before I never do it again. Which I know is a terrible idea. I have been scared of the needle for so long, I wish I would have stayed scared. My bad for the long ass post, I’m still geeked out like a motherfucker. No sleep for me for awhile lol."

I ran out of my go go juice recently and I was planning on getting sober, but I only really do that when I end my binge on a good note. I ended it with realizing I only had enough left for that day, my car broke down, I just turned 21 and the dispensary denied my id.(a different shop took it yesterday) so I call up homeboy and he comes down. He's sold me bunk shit once before, but I ain't gonna give him shit if I cant at least see it has shards. He pulls up at my local plaza shopping place and walks over to me and he has a fake can of wd-40 with the shit inside. I tell him we can go behind the store over here like this is my spot its lowkey af.

(Also didnt mention I sent him like $30 for gas cuz he lives far already its bullshit i know but he said he'd discount me)
 He starts acting all paranoid and tells me either take it and give him the money or he's leaving. In my head I'm thinking awwwwwwwww hellllllll nahhhh. I followed him to his car trying to get him to just let me see what I'm buying. We get to his car and he tells me ""I'll call you in 30 minutes."" 

At this moment I was done. I wasn't playing his damn games anymore. I said ""I just wanna fucking see it,"" snatched it from his hands and started running towards home. He pulls up on me a little ways away hella mad wanting his shit back. I was still willing to pay him at this point if the shit was real. I popped it open and it looked kinda like crushed up shards but I knew it was either heavily cut or fake so i just said ""what the fuck is this?"" handed it back to him and went home.

So that's how I saved myself from getting fucked again. Found a new plug the other day and it's some of the best I've had in a long time. You win some you lose some.

So I took around 360mg + 200mg of caffeine at night, the most safe moment to test chemicals because I live with my parents. After some time I noticed the buzz, I was re-watching breaking bad for the 5st time, and that shit was AMAZING, like if I had never watched it.

After some time watching it, laughing and becoming hyped like a maniac (lol) I noticed that I was horny as a bull too, so I watched some porn and jerked off about eleven times (lol).

I don't sleep all that night, neither the next night, I got amped about 3 days of full energy and happines, after that affects vanished, got a painful crash, but that passed quick.

I’ve been using almost only 2-FMA and 3-FPM.

Most amphetamines cause dopamine reuptake. What that means is dopamine is forced throughout the brain. Dopamine is your ""reward hormones"", also pleasure hormone.

What this allows is increasing the reward and pleasure from the reward towards a task.

So talking to that friend, is more rewarding to talk to. 

You ended your post concerned about having the
""drive"" to complete tasks. Well actually that's Serotonin's job, another hormone in the brain that inspires drive and motivation.

Dextroamphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine, vyvanse[post conversation]) really only pushes dopamine. So you have all the reward, but might still not that the drive.

The only ADHD stimulant that allows for serotonin reuptake (pushing serotonin throughout the brain) is methamphetamine.

Actually methamphetamine is the most effective ADHD medication on the market (it's called Desoxyn, 5mg pills, pharma meth). With a max therapeutic dose listed by the FDA of 30/mg. Way less than Adderall (60), Dextrine(60), Vyvanse (70).

Methamphetamine is x3 a potent as Dextroamphetamine. It also can pass through the blood brain barrier, allowing for a fast onset. The liver has special enzyme that takes 12-14 hours to deplete the substance in your body, and it's a IR form. It is also very very subtle, and takes far less substance to achieve a more harmonious treatment without all the negitve side effects 

Methamphetamine is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD, Narcolepsy &amp; Major Depressive Disorder (seratonin)

Thou, the loop holes to actually achieve being scripted this is far fetched. 

Once a doctor see's ""methamphetamine hcl"" as the active ingredient, they will probably look at u like ""wtf"". 

Also you will have a hard time getting a pharmacy to order the medication for you , because of this same reason, you might get horrible stares from the staff. 

Well I hope this has been informative.

201,0,"Took roughly 200mg Amphetamine over the course of 24hrs snorted, last dose was 24hrs ago, my HR is absoloutely fucked it's 75-80 normal resting, 120 on stims, after the 200mg I was down to a hr below 60 which freaked me out, my HR is now 117 after 24 hrs off the amps.

IF I was to take a small redose would this make my HR worse? I did a rythym test through this app that says I have a possible atrial fibrillation but I'm not sure if it's just the amp comedown messing with the rythym causing a false positive for atrial fib.

Currently trying to get a diagnoses for my chest pain, shortness of breath &amp; highly irregular rythym. Usually I'd just take is as part of the comedown but the really low hr after 200mg amp along with the possible atrial fib diagnoses is what worries me!!"

212,0,"One proven method to attract shadow people is Beta Delta brainwave alternating  inducement pulses to frontal  cortex. THis is achieved a technology that is  readily available parts.  Kits can be bought on Amazon.   
Shadow people watching enthusiasts  prefer to call Beta Delta brainwave alternating  inducement pulsing  as Bad Dreaming Attractor technique or simply Bad Dreaming. 

Shadow people  are creatures  that exist as vibrations in the range of the visible electromagnetic spectrum  of very dim colors.  That is why perceive them as shadows.  It is unknown how  the vibrations maintain their harmonics  and don' t immediately  degrade into  static and dissipate completely.    


Though  they are almost intangible ,DARPA is working on a way weaponize them.  There was an incident  where 7 scientists were killed by shadow people. The scientists were experimenting  with ELF ( extremely low frequency ) for  a pentagon mind control experiment.  It is theorized they inadvertently caused a harmonic  resonance that not only attracted shadow people but made them hostile.  All their work is said to be destroyed but many see  what DARPA  is doing evidence that they are in possession of the journals. 

""  
""If it is dangerous, we can weaponize it"" is DARPAs motto. 

Bad dreaming attractor techniques   create  hyper-rphasic   super-harmonic resonance that attracts shadow. people . Meth psychosis  causes the human brain to alternate between  Beta Delta  brainwaves just like bad dreaming attractor techniques.  Bad dreaming is hardware  and meth psychosis is the chemical equivalent.

216,0,"So, 7 years ago, on the night after my freinds funeral... I did meth for the first time. 

Before my freind passed I was completely against meth, although I did take vyvanse for my adhd at the time. It wasn’t because I thought it would kill me or that I was above it or anything. I just knew it was gonna be one of those; as my dad would say “genie that won’t go back in the bottle”

Even tho I have adhd, I’ve had this problem (some would say) where I can literally sleep forever... I’ve been this way since I was a little kid. I have very vivid and lucid dreams on a constant basis. And If I may, I would dare say, dreaming is the first drug I ever became a junkie for... it’s just like a hard drug to me, when I wake up I’m angry cause I just wanna go back into the chaos of my subconscious and don’t care if I die there. 

I say this is a problem because it has caused me many of argument, late arrival to school/work. Procrastination of very important tasks, etc. 

So not only does speed help me concentrate on things in my life, it also gives me the energy to make it through a normal day without just shutting off and becoming a vegetable.

This is gonna be a long one so buckle up if your riding along.

Back to where I left off. The night I smoked crank for the first time I was immediately hooked.. no waiting 30 to 45 minutes for my pill to kick in, plus I could smoke it so it was a bonus for me as I hate snorting shit up my nose.

But I had a obstacle, my girlfriend. I knew I could never let her know about this. In a way that kept me only doing it on the weekends and not everyday. That was until I found out a coworker on my shift did it and I could get it more frequently. At this point my usage completely flipped to every day before and after work and taking the weekends to build my tolerance up. My gf was none the wiser to my activities and everything was good for a couple years.

Then one day I get arrested for possessing 4 grams of dabs(shatter,wax,honey oil) found in my car over an out headlight. ..

I had to be enrolled in day report, call in everyday, get drug tested randomly the whole nine. Well the first 6 months I stopped everything... granted I only had six months of day report to go through. As a foolish choice I decided the last week I’d smoke some crank seeing as I had already been tested I figured hey I’m clear. Nope, very last day I piss dirty then sent back to jail. When I got out I explained to my gf that I failed for coke being as for some reason coke is more acceptable a drug to the masses than meth. She was still furious, but not as furious as she could have been. I continued using, every weekday for work like I had been, until I got a new job... this time i only worked with one other person and he was way more of an addict than I am... eventually my gf found out almost lost her but she must see something in me I don’t cause she’s still sticking it out for me. 

I want to quit, I really do. But I know that’s going to lead me to severe depression from abnormal amounts of sleep I engulfed in... I’ve tried but all that ever happens is I sleep eat and can’t shit, get bloated to the point of misery and eventually give in just so I can finally drop a deuce 😑 fuck I love what meth has done for my mind but I hate the dependency I’ve created for it. Sorry for the long ramble, but just been on my mind sloth this week"

I contemplated asking her, but she has always been a little iffy in the charity department. Anyways, I ended up just stealing 5 pills (100 mg) and taking them right before I left. Now I haven’t had any uppers but a little shitty cocaine in over 3 years, and 7 hours after liftoff I still haven’t slowed down.

I noticed that if I just started to do something, I was engaged for awhile. Obviously I wasn’t as hiddey-ho about it is I would have been on real speed, but it did give me an intense focus if I just put my foot forward first.

Last time I did the leftover meth I started with snorting like 50mg I think, and while I was solidly Stimmed I wasn't in rapture on anything. Redosed 120mg after 7 or 8 hours and got properly high again but no overamp or anything crazy. So I'd say the meth I have is a bit on the weaker side.

Since I want the most intense euphoria (without IV'ing) I could handle for what will be the last binge in some time, I thought about just plugging a full 100-150mg dose and seeing what happens.
You think that could be overamp level since my last time was nearly 2 months ago?

I feel like the euphoria of the initial dose usually drowns out unpleasant effects, so 100-150mg shouldn't be unpleasant even if they rock my world, does that hold true in your experience?"

I am awake for 24 hours now and usually already my brain feels fried as fuck and overall I feel dirty and unpleasant.

Anyways, i don't take my medication every single day. i only use it when i know i need to be able to focus. because of this, i do have a little bit of room to try higher dosages at times without running out before i can get a refill. anyways i just took one 15mg extended release and 25 mg instant a little over an hour ago and i hardly feel a thing. maybe just a subtle mood boost. im certainly getting the whole hyper focus kinda thing, but no body high or mental high. is that a low dose for recreational use? or do you think my tolerance is high due to regular use for ADD? i always here that dexedrine and adderall can be really pleasant highs but any time i've taken a little extra it doesn't do much and feels wasteful. what is a standard dose for recreational use? and what is considered more of a heavy dose? i dont wanna go overboard, but perhaps i need to take what is considered a heavy dose. thanks."

I had basically no stim tolerance after a half a year break from adderall and the last 2 days I used around 200mg of meth in 25-50mg doses.

I have a few more addies coming tomorrow and have 45mg adderall left and about 40mg meth  right now.

I was gonna take one more dose, and was planning on the adderall so I can actually sleep in 5-6 hours since I've been up for almost 2 days and save my last hit of meth for when i use the other adderalls I'm getting tomorrow the next time I speed for a couple days next week or weekend....

That being said, will the 45mg adderall be enough to do anything significant or should I just save it for when I get 90mg more so I can dose 2 times with 135mg, or just use the meth now because it would be a waste with cross tolerance?

but god damn jimmy, this shit is so wack. It's almost like 2-fa with the stimulation and minimal euphoria, and I feel like that's giving it too much credit. This shit has me up for so long, but the actual effects last substantially less than actual meth. 


I got it in the mail and the baggie contained a few medium sized shard ontop of a bunch of crushed to shit shards. I immediately went to take a 60mg line and there was literally no rush at all. There were slight effects, but there was no rush. I stopped weighing this shit out cos I don't even know what it's effective range is.


Honestly this was a bad idea anyway, I have no business doing stimulants at this point in my life, so I'm kind of glad that I got this grade A bullshit. Probably gonna toss it within the next day. I still have a desire to binge and continue doing it even though its garbage, which is the worst part.

305,0,"Medical record:

Diagnosed with ADHD as a child

All medication I was given as a kid had negative side effects so i stopped taking them. 

Amphetamines got listed as an allergy when i was like 13 because it made me depressed.

Experimented with meth at 16 ended up in ER and had to admit to GP i used it but didn't like it. ***Now listed in medical record as substance abuse with detailed comments.***

Admitted i smoke weed daily. ***Now listed as cannabis dependence.***

What i need:

Need an amphetamine-like prescription after trying my old dextroamphetamine meds and realizing that i still suffer from ADHD as an adult and how much it is effecting my concentration. I can never stay concentrated and have been trying to learn programming and animation for YEARS making marginal improvements due to not being able to concentrate and also not being able to stay on the same topic for very long. I am passionate about these 2 things but my brain is holding me back from actually learning it.

My problem:

As you can see i have quite a bad medical record making it hard for any doc to not view me as a liability and instead give me some trash drugs that are more dangerous and not as helpful.

I have not tried to get a prescription or even bring up my ADHD problems since i was a kid so not sure how hard it will be OR the process i need to go through in order to get the prescription. I am just running it past reddit before i go see a doc to make sure i dont ruin my chances. Don't plan on abusing these meds, i actually feel like they would make me 100% more productive.

My question:

What can i do to maximize my chances of getting a prescription?

Will it be extremely difficult if not impossible to get a prescription?

What can i do to not ruin my chances of getting a prescription?"

So now my tolerance is fucked and i'm feeling like an addict because of it. I can't even use them meds for what i got 'em prescribed cuz i feel shit from a normal dose (= 1x54mg concerta + 2x - or 3x ritalin IR)

311,0,Besides going to the corners is there a good app I haven't had any luck with wisper.any advice would be greatly appreciated.
312,0,"TLDR towards the end, im high as shit and believe it or not edited this to make it shorter. I apologize. Unfortunately I struggle to avoid typing a fuckton even when I'm sober.

I don't smoke a lot. I haven't smoked a lot actually, would be a better way to put it. My area of expertise when it comes to drugs as a whole is moreso a variety of pills and weed.

To try to put my perspective into yours - I feel the same way I do about meth, that I felt about weed when I first started smoking as a young teen. I'm just not as stupid as an adult.

It compares to my feelings with meth because, now I'm an adult, although I don't want to be wasting THEIR shit and THEIR high AND MINE by doing it wrong, I still have no idea about meth, or how to properly smoke. When I was a kid I didn't think of shit like this. Now, if I didn't feel my hit from the bubble, I feel defeated. I couldn't afford the damn addiction to stims in the first place, definitely couldn't afford relapsing &amp; possibly triggering a bigger addiction, &amp; I didn't get any higher but the bag is emptier.

Also, I don't know what the fuck I'm looking at. This bag of crystals gives me the same confusion as my first bag of shake I got when I was a kid. Except when I was a kid, I didn't care if I got ripped off, and if it was laced then cool, free high to brag about. Now, my money matters, and I have responsibility. I can't be walking into the road talking to myself like a lot of addicts were in my state when a batch of meth came about laced with other shit. I forget the name. Basically, I've become a more mature idiot when it comes to making bad decision. I won't do a line of what someone says is coke, if they offer me some. I won't eat a shroom when my friends bring out a bag they didn't tell me about. I think through my stupid decisions now, and yeah miss some fun shit over it, but it is what it is.


Anyway, TLDR, my questions: 

1.

Short version:
How do I know if I'm getting shit I shouldn't smoke? (Preferably ways by looking at it or symptoms or taste I shouldn't have.)

Long version:
The person I smoke with mentioned because of the virus, the shit isn't the best, and they spent a few hrs cleaning it after we waited a few ungodly hours waiting for the dude to come to us with some. I understand there is ways to test it or ""clean"" it, but I can't do those things. I stay very private. Think Donald Trump in disguise, smoking meth in a bunker, then setting the entire bunker on fire. Along with the clothes he's wearing, because being seen naked in public is better than the public knowing he smokes meth. Less is better when it comes to a mess, but I'll do it if it's the only way to garuntee I won't get fucked off something that isn't meth....but besides that is there any visual telltale signs that the shit shouldn't be smoked/isn't entirely or at all meth? Any symptoms that aren't normal? Right, if I feel symptoms that aren't normal it's too late already, but the question still stands.


2.

Short version:
What are some tips to get a good hit EVERYTIME/not waste shit &amp; money? Is most of it trial and error?

Long version:
The only person that I am around when I smoke and who has taught me how, always burns the shit. Look, I have no experience, I stick to pill form of amphetamine. The only drugs I've smoked are weed/oil, or a Xanax I smoked as a dumbfuck teenager. Still, by scrolling fast past meth posts on this sub because I'm here for the pills, I already know that he is doing SOMETHING wrong because the pipe has black, burnt spots. There's no ""crack back"" (wtf is that by the way? LOL) and the bubble has to be wiped off, similar to when I'd burn a weed pipe in the process of heating it up to scrape resin off the sides of it to clean it. This burnt shit is annoying, gets EVERYWHERE, and isn't the right thing to do. But this person is old, smoking a long time, etc whatever. Why TF do they not know how to do it right? 

They hold the flame(Bic lighter) an inch from the bubble. Keep holding it there the entire hit. Pipe turns black. Turn off lighter when done inhaling.

It works, obviously by my essay I've typed out, but how in the world am I supposed to walk my dumb looking ass in the room and say, nah, you're doing it wrong, when I can count my encounters with this shit on my hands, and they know that bc it's always around them?! Lmao.....

The thought came about showing them videos from this reddit, and then I realized that most of the old addicts I meet won't even say the drugs name out loud. Too many experiences getting busted, admit you do it alone in a room and then start on the trail that you're going to jail for the next week. Along with ur friends. I chalk it up to years of drug use on the brain, trauma, and paranoia. Anyway, if I whipped out my phone on this sub and showed a video, they'd consider me a dumbass from then on. Or just start acting like I'm some kind of narc. If they were my age range, they probably wouldn't give a fuck, but they aren't. not to mention this specific person I am physically scared of, and they're a little short tempered and slow, and take thing personally real quick. I'd probably be threatened by them if I mentioned how they smoke, which, be as idiotic as it may be, and yeah I wish I had cooler people to be around, but again, I am Donald Trump in a bunker on fire. I don't really want friends that do this drug. Hell, this person won't even let me buy a bubble off of them because they don't think I should have one. I'm sure a gas station employee would deny Trump a meth pipe, too.


Anyway, I should stop typing before I trail off on a fuckton of other shit. I mean no harm by mentioning Trump and has nothing to do with my political views. And I apologize again for the fuckton of useless info.

I just wanna know how to not smoke bad meth and end up on Flocka and how to smoke it properly/tell a long time addict that they are wasting the shit I paid for even tho I don't even know how much they wasted bc I'm so naive about it all :/"

There’s probably heaps of posts on here already about paranoia but I cbf looking through them all atm.

I was wondering if anyone has any tips (literally anything). I mainly become paranoid when I’m around people who don’t know that I do it/and I don’t want them to find out. Usually it’s my housemates (I have 10) and my partner’s parents where I paz the most. 
It sucks because I do enjoy it, it’s just it doesn’t take much for me to think that certain people know or are going to find out. Even when I know everything is fine, the paranoia won’t leave and I don’t end up enjoying it like usual. 
I usually do it 2 or 3 times a month on weekends and go through 1.7 g/maybe more with my boyfriend. 
Any help is appreciated"

322,0,"If you have not read my last post do so.


Thank you all for such great advice. I have made a deception pretty early and I have stashed away my meth in someone’s hands who I live with, who I have known for a long time and I also know that this person would not do it. He is not appealed and usually when comes to other things he will ask before he uses it. So I am fine with that. I am going to try and go 2-3 days without as he is going to help me learn self control. Him and I have copious amounts of marijuana. Whenever I have a crave I will go and smoke weed instead.


My plan is to learn to go without it as well as learning self control. But once it is gone it’s over and there will not being hitting my guy up, I deleted his number so I am fine. He wouldn’t even think about hitting me up because he is always everywhere.


Listen, I had to think long and hard. I am going to be 26 soon. This is not who am as a person. Ya know?  But listen, I know how this works. Instead of saying I’ll not do it. I mean I will not do it. It’s happened with me in the past. But I am slowing trapping myself there again.

I never thought reddit would help me but vent. You guys again. Thank you. 

Just know, if I do fall back I will  always be honest. 
I know I am not a horrible person for what I have done with my life for the last 3 months. I didn’t harm anyone, never yelled or got after people. I was if anything just really nice I guess. Not acting hyper at my job or being overconfident in way, . I just know I will call this a 90 day party. People can think whatever. But I have had people from work (who use anything) and tell me that I do not act or look like an former addict. 

Smoking some weed literally as I write this line.

323,0,"I dosed around 100mg, just redosed up to 100mg now of speed (amphetamine sulf) and noticed my BP goes up but not really my HR. I checked it and it spiked when I was having anxiety, was also standing when taking it to 148/78 and pulse 72, but now checking it's 129/75 and pulse 73 to 67..

Is this normal? I did do the redoses quite spread out aswell in 20mg redoses. It's just so strange, 3-fpm raises it when I end up redosing that quite frequently, but amphetamines don't really, unless I'm not doing that much?

I shouldn't of been standing probably for the measurements as I've heard that increases it/causes innacuracies even if I place my arm over my shoulder... but it still indicates highered BP at least in 130/75 ranges imo.

should note the speed does not burn really that much.. is that typical of washed speed? was sold it as ""washed"""

345,0,"ADVICE IS WELCOMED. BUT NO LECTURES OR CRITICISM PLEASE!!

Hello everyone. I have used reddit for a long time. But decided to take this to a different level as into deleting my old account and making a new one. 

Life is pretty fucked in my brain as I can see though the bullshit I guess, I see the beauty when I am high on drugs. People are fake, people only bend down to please someone else and there needs. 

I have used meth for a few months. I love it. I won’t deny it. Love every bit. 

I was clean for a year and a half. I will not disclose where I work. I started working last year and  I started using after the cook at work gave me some for free. I loved it, I missed it. I was up for 2 day’s having a grand time.

Everyday I just smoke and smoke. I take care of myself though. I don’t ignore my body. I take care of business before I pleaE myself. 

I am a musician, I play the guitar and have wrote music since 2010. I am 25 now. I dabbled with MDMA , shrooms etc.

I took adderall when I was 8 years old. I did not like the feeling as I never talked and would not eat. I believe it has fucked with me a bit in someways.

I grew up with a good loving family. My step dad died when I was young. My mom was very young too. She became dependent on stuff, but is clean. She has no idea of what I am doing.

I have dealt with trauma that I will soon get into later as the day’s go by. I will try to do this everyday. Just bear with me.

I use and I spend around 150$ every two weeks. Easy to find when you live near Oregon. I do not know why I do this. I always feel I am escaping but I’m not running from anything. 

I am going to be seeing a dentist until this coronavirus slows. My teeth are fine, just one broke and a receding gum line.Just haven’t seen one in a decade. Sometimes I have anxiety because of the propaganda they did in 2004 about meth. But I know it’s because people do not take care of themselves.

First in the line of losses was this guy who always pushed boundaries (talked about friends family members and girlfriends in extremely disrespectful sexual ways, cheated with friends girlfriends, ect.) and he he pushed me for the last time when he hit up my girlfriend tryna make suggestive hints at some things that weren't just friendly. 

2nd 3rd and 4th all kinda happened together, they started talking shit and getting massive attitudes over nothing acting like some ungrateful selfish bitch asses for everything me and og friend had done for them and one day it just got to the limit so og friend and I cut 2 of them off because those were the ones that were sneak dissing us like we wouldn't see it and the 3rd just slowly faded away with them. 

Now i got og friend and his brother, his brother hits me up to complain about his issues but has been turning colder and colder towards me when i do the same until he basically just said good luck after i broke down to him about how i feel like im a failure and ill never achieve the goals i have for myself, so that instantly turned any feeling towards him off 

Og friend has been half my brother half distant our whole relationship when i started this post i rlly thought we were done as well but he actually is seeming to care about our friendship and putting effort into keeping it as of now so the name is no longer lost all my friends but i just hope that i can keep this relationship because meth doesn't take away reality it just makes it a bit more tolerable."

370,0,"So I had a shocking hangover, after enjoying a some drinks from the second day of being in my 30s, and I was anxious and feeling nauseous.

I’m not going to make a habit out of it, because I hate hangovers. I think alcohol is the worst drug out there. I have experienced a comedown from stimulants, but it’s nowhere near as bad as a hangover. Maybe it’s because I take a relatively low dose? I only take 10mg at a time.

ANYWAYS- do heroin tonight, go to sleep, wake up tomorrow and crank it up for family day...

385,0,"So I’ve used meth for 3 and a half years now and because of having to stay functional for work and hide my use I never really push past 2 nights up in a row. 2 nights is manageable but the 3rd night is where things get weird and harder to control. 

Although to most of you this isn’t shit but my current record for longest time awake with no sleep is 90 hours. Not something I ever thought I would beat or even attempt to beat. However tonight after a binge I have found myself extremely close and decided to go for it.

I’m currently at 90 hours awake right now so I’ve matched my record, I wanna go for 100 hours, I’ve got 9 hours left and it’s starting to become a real struggle and difficult, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it, but I’m gonna give it my best shot."
389,0,"Okay, so sometimes when I use meth, my eye (generally the left eye) will go cross-eyed or point inward. I find that this generally occurs if I either haven't slept the night before, or slept for only about 3 hours. 

However, there'll be times when I get enough sleep the night before but I'll look in the mirror and realize that one of my eyes (usually my left) isn't quite in the same direction as my right eye. This is what really bothers me. There'll be times when I don't realize that my eyes aren't quite looking in the same direction and I only figure it out because I look in a mirror or whatever (when this happens, you kinda have to really be looking for it) but sometimes I can feel a little pressure on my left eye and I can pretty much bet that if I look in the mirror, my left eye will be pointed inwards a little (noticeable but not nearly as obvious as when my left eye points inwards due to lack of sleep the night before). 

I take vitamins to help with some of the negative effects that meth has on the body. I eat, drink water, etc. I'm not sure what else I can do to try and stop this. Does anyone know why my eye might have a tendency to point inwards while using stims and do you have suggestions for how to combat this. I've been having classes online where they require us to share video or lose points on our grade and today I realized during one of my classes that my eyes weren't quite aligned. So I'd like to fix this (preferably without stopping use)."
390,0,"This might be a messy post but anyone had a mild sore throat recently with symptoms you've never experienced before? Normally when I get a sore throat it worsens by day two. I had a mild -and I mean very mild - sore throat for just 3 days. I snorted meth as usual, along with rubbing honey and cayenne pepper in the back of my throat, gargling salt eater, drinking lots of very hot tea and honey, and some vit c here and there. 

I have had a sore throat in the past when I was using but it never stayed so mild and I think I slowed down on my using when I got sick but this time I used as normal (about 3 lines during the day). By day 4, the sore throat was gone and now I had mucus which annoyed the shit out of me because it made it hard to snort my lines, so I was blowing my nose constantly and at some points I felt like the meth was clearing it out so I would instinctually not crush up my lines as much, idk I really thought the meth was killing the virus lol. 

So like I said, normally when I get sick like this, the mucus phase will go on for a few more days at least and my sore throat def gets worse. Well, by night time, I had much less and I layed down and felt a huge ball of phlegm and went to go spit it out– it was huge!  Disgusting, thick and yellow. I instantly wasn't sick anymore. Totally tripped me out. My boyfriend thinks it's corona for some wild reason and also has a mild sore throat and is worried he's put his work in jeopardy but his is mild as well. Litarally never had a sore throat like this but I seriously feel like the meth beat it or some shit. Anyone had that experience with beating a cold or anything? Or anyone had a weird sore throat recently?"

412,0,"Hi Guys,

Just wanted to hear anyone's anecdotal reports on the time it takes between taking their last dose of Amphetamine (paste) and when sleep is possible? I realize this can be significantly effected by dosages and tolerance, but as a general rule how long do you find it takes?

Psychonaght Wiki suggests total a total duration of effects of 6-8 hours, although I have heard many people mention that it takes them 12+ hours before sleep is possible! 

I generally have benzos on hand if things get rough but I try to minimize their use as much as possible. So how late in the day is it still safe to use if you don't want to interfere with sleep?

Thanks!"

Ive taken a lot of breaks here and there to get my tolerance under control, sometimes halving my dose for a week or so, or not taking any for like 2 days. But that doesnt seem to do anything.

450,0,"I have a script for amphetamine. 40mg xr total/day. Have to call in refills. Called to refill. Receptionist said the psych normally writes a script instead of send electronically, I tell her he's sent it electronically since I've been prescribed (which has been like 6 months now?). She acts weird. Says she'll let him know and confirms my usual pharmacy.
Then, recent appt with psych. I say I think I need a higher dose. He says the pills don't go any higher than 30mg. Looks at his notes and thinks for a second. Asks if I need it everyday or just some days. I say just some days, figuring I can settle for 15 pills extra instead of 30 if that's what it comes down to. He says I can take my 10mg pill with my 30 in the morning when I feel like I need it. I ask well what about my afternoon dose? Because the 10mg is for afternoons/easier comedown/more focus later in the day when 30 wears off. He says I can still take that too. Doesn't write a script for extra pills tho. So basically I'll run out early if I listen to him. Whatever though. I decided to lay off. I don't care enough.

Go to pharmacy. Hand them my 30mg script. Ask if they received another script electronically, they confirm, then say I don't need the 30 then because they got the 10. Then realize they're two different ones, say nevermind, they'll fill it and it'll take 30min-60min because it's controlled. I say ok thanks.

Is it just me or was this weird? as if something was on my records all of a sudden to make them suspect I'm abusing my script. But I typically am late to refill by a few days anyway, because I forget to. It's not like I try to refill early on a regular basis. I even told my psych that some days I must forget to take my dose because I have extras laying around. Which is completely true.

It just felt like they all acted weird. I go to that pharmacy regularly for my scripts, they know I have two. They know I know it's controlled. I speak to the receptionist over the phone regularly, the people at the office are the ones who explained to me how to call and ask for an electronic refill. It's nothing new. And I know there's people who take more than 30mg xr in the morning, why does it matter it's the highest dose in one pill? Why not give me another? Is it because I already have two scripts, three would seem excessive? But then, why not raise my 10mg to 20?

I'm letting it go and just playing it safe by saying my doses are fine for the next, idk, 6 months, or longer, because im not trying to lose my script, and I have extras all the time anyway, but I just felt so weird today about it all. Maybe it's because I was being an addict. So I have a reason to feel guilty."

For any of you who take adderall or dex, what dose schedule do you have? I am particularly curious about people who take IR.

I have been trying to find the right dose for two months now with my psychiatrist’s help of course. If I take 10 mg, I feel almost nothing. If I take 15mg, It works great but I end up having a harsh comedown. Here is the schedule that works best for me: 7am: 15 11: 10 2: 5- to help the comedown- doesn’t always work.

I have been an increasingly habitual smoker of meth for almost 3 years or so. I rarely have days where I do not partake and whenever I do it's probably not my choice. I slowly but surely built up a tolerance by now and I'm not 100% sure on the numbers but I'd guess I consume about a ball every 4-7 days depending on what's going on. So this fucking virus is kind of an asshole because, now jobless, my sack is about empty, and so is my wallet. I'll survive as far as necessities and food and everything but my drug money is nonexistent. 
With that being said, the impending doom of maybe having to sleep again sometime soon is not something I'm excited for. I have about fifteen 25mg XR amphetamine salts capsules though. If I've been rolling bowls for a few years what would the equivalent be for me to maintain my preferred state of mind?

As a reference, I am a 25 year old caucasian male, mostly active, with neither a healthy nor an unhealthy diet. I drink a ton of water, make sure I keep up with electrolytes, and I take one packet of those shit defying Magnesium Calm drinks each night.

On both paper and at a molecular it would make sense that an anti-psychotic would blunt the good feelings from stimulants.

A strong atypical is going to hang around that dopamine receptor like a fly on shit. On paper, the answer is pretty clear. If an antipsychotic is bound to a receptor site, until certain conditions are met, it will stay there until metabolism has run its course OR until the []'s of AP drop low enough for something else to kick it out of a receptor site. 


I'm prescribed 30mg (15x2) of Dexedrine XR (the pharmacy actually made an error and rather than 30mg once a day, they filled my script for 30mg twice a day. That's four 15mg Dexedrine, and even on most days the most I take is 30mg. My conscience urged me to say something, but I knew that the moment I saw that big orange bottle with Halloween coloured pills, my fate was sealed.

Suffice it to say I have a stockpile. 

Anyway. 

I also have Seroquel (150mg) PRNs for nights I really can't fall asleep. When I ignore the 60 a day error, and take 15m. I sleep fine and all is well (no need for seroquel either). When I take a larger dose of Seroquel on 15mg days OR 30mg days, it feels like I haven't even had a coffee. Depends on ROA with respect to dose and subjective effects.

Like any intelligent pharmaceutical enthusiast, I decided to experiment. 

Let's assume tolerance does not play a role.

I take weekends off, supps, the whole nine yards. 


15 mg Dex + nill = somewhat stimulated.

30 mg Dex + nill = stimulated 

45mg Dex + nill = very stimulated + 10mg diazepam (takes the edge off)

Etc.

However; 

15mg Dex + Seroquel the night before = can't even get out of bed. 

That said, talking about larger doses is a waste of our time.

I would need at least 30mg, sometimes even 45mg to feel remotely alert or attempt to focus on just a single task, so I don't even bother with the Dex, and tuck four away for a rainy day. Even after a tolerance break, the premise holds true. Strangely enough, I still feel the physical effects of stimulation (BPM increase, bowel motility, hypertension). I've done the whole tums to neutralize stomach pH, and it happens regardless of ROA (Oral vs. plugging).

The latter observation is what motivated me to ask the question. Well, it could also be the Dex, but in science we can't assume.

Keep in mind that all of these are prescribed by my psychiatrist, and the intention of this post is to ask you guys if my logic is sound OR if you know anyone (that is not yourself) who experiences something similar.

Thoughts?

Notes: 
- the dulling effect does not occur if I take my [prescribed] Temazepam instead of the Seroquel.

Some might ask, why not just take the Temaz? 
Well, i've learned that I'm 100x more likely to wake up somewhere strange with no memories of the night(s) before with no phone, wallet, dignity, and a ton of debit transactions that remain unknown to me. The only thing I have left are crumbled receipts in my pocket and some crack change because my wallet is in the wind, and most of my pride with it. 

- it mostly gets better as the day goes on (as one would assume) and/or if I follow the actual instructions and take all four 15mg in one day."

I just went off of the Psychonaut wiki's dose-strength spectrum and saw that 40 mg is right about at the line of common/strong, which I'm looking for. Probably the worst possible thing will be an expectation of how good it will feel and then having natural disappointment that it's not meth, but that's alright, just gotta manage expectations and wait for meth mail next week. One positive, I guess, is having to shit with anticipatory excitement, whether that excitement is warranted or not I'll see here soon enough."

15,0,"There are a couple of types of alcoholics on Intervention, but the main ones are 1. gonna die soon and 2. really drunk but probably gonna be fine. 

Assuming we trust the metrics Intervention gives us:.

The gonna die drunks drink:

1 gallon
2 fifths
3 fifths
1+ fifths but many beers/other drinks (as best they can estimate, I figure)

a day.

I'm really bad with math so someone has to correct the numbers on this. But I was thinking about this to figure out when bad drunk crosses the line into ""you're gonna die"" drunk and how much my regular drinking might resemble it. 

I don't understand bottle sizes. I don't understand math.

But I tried, so:

What I figured is:

Say you buy your liquor in gallons and drink til you need to buy a new one. However many days that lasts.

*checks notes*

ML (fifths) = 1000ml to 1 liter
750ML (a fifth) x 2 (two fifths) = 1500ML
1.75liters (a gallon/handle) = 1750ML

SO

If you exceed 500ML x2 a day (1000ML = 1 liter) you are in very bad alcoholic territory and probably really need to cut that shit back.

Shit, the google page I was using to convert fluids on is gone, but so long story short:

As long as you drink A PINT/LESS THAN HALF A LITER of vodka a day, if you are a daily drinker

You will be fine

If you are drinking a pint or liter of liquor a day

Thanks to the stupid Coronavirus the liquor stores in my area have been closing super early and I was an idiot and didn't stock up before hand. All it got left is a cheap fifth of RichnRare 40% abv. I drank half one day then a little more the next and now tonight I barley have any left. It's filled to about where the line indentation is underneath the label at the bottom of the bottle. I'd say about 2 maybe 3 shots left at max. My question is are there any tricks you guys know of to get me a little drunk off that much? Maybe mix it with something to make it more potent. Because I drink to get drunk and I don't even wanna bother if I'm not even gonna get a buzz on what's left. I know they have a website called alcohol hacks but couldn't find an answer there

55,0,"So this is a somewhat long story, about 8 months ago my friend and I got home from a fun night at a water park with a few girls, before we left for the water park we decided to take 2-3 shots of malibu and then left for it, as soon as we got back it was around 9pm and his parents were asleep but his two older DJ brothers were up making music and playing drinking games. NOW MIND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART, (I’m 16, so PLEASE if you’re gonna say something about me being too young to drink or that I shouldn’t at all, don’t even mind commenting) so we played a game where we had to guess the remix of a song and drink if we got it wrong, and then drink more if his brothers girlfriend got it before us. Before we started playing, we of course had to start off the party with a chugged corona, and then we started. We were drinking some very heavy foreign (vodka/liquor?) we got from oman on vacation, and we weren’t taking shots we drank straight from the bottle, and around 9-10 BIG gulps in like the equivalent of a shot and a half and i’m absolutely pitted, this is the first time i’ve actually drank/gotten drunk, like i’ve taken shots before that and got a “buzz” but i got absolutely wasted that night and threw up for like 2 hours straight then went to bed and woke up with a massive hangover and threw up again. In the morning even the slightest smell of alcohol made me wanna throw up. For 3 months after that I literally couldn’t even smell alcohol without gagging, let alone drink, before that night drinking was pretty easy for me, now I FEAR to hangout with the boys on the nights they wanna drink because i can take a very small sip and completely gag on it and almost throw up.
 Do you know if my intolerance will ever go away since I am still young? or did i send it too hard on a one night party and fuck up my drinking life forever...

1. What do you know about sour beers?

As you may or may not know a sour beer is… one that has been deliberately brewed to achieve high levels of acidity. This elevated acidity delivers a predominantly sour flavor to the beer as opposed to the bitter or sweet flavors found in standard ales and lagers.

2. \^\^\^What sounds most interesting about that?

3. Have you tried a sour before?

Nowadays the relationship we share is hanging by a thread because, the guy is just simply a bum with no goals in life aimlessly straddling through life for the last decade  (I've known him that long) and for some reason i keep hanging with him.. in the recent months our drinking sessions have resulted in him acting like a complete jerk and straight disrespecting me without any care in the world. (Pretend you're with a complete stranger who is drunk and pissed at you) like i could sense the hostility but i find no reason for it. I've had my problems in life which i have shared with said associate.

What im actually trying to say here is... stupid drunk peoples excuse for acting like an asshole or something is I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. when they were clearly not SHITFACED.

176,0,"Hey guys! This will be a slightly lengthy post but I’m just detailing my first proper night out. 

A quick background check on me is that I’m 19 and my family is super religious, while I’m not, although they don’t know that. I also don’t really like going to parties and I haven’t been to any in over a year simply because they get boring quickly when you don’t drink. The only thing I have ever drank prior to last night was a single shot of vodka as a dare. I had a work party last night and most people I work with are 24 and under. So everyone was drinking a lot. We also smoked some herb but that’s not relevant atm. 

I got in and had someone ordered me a rum and coke which tasted horrid but I drank most of it. We then all took a shot of Wray and Nephews which destroyed my internal organs for a good few minutes. This is about 40 minutes into the party and I’ve only had these 2 drinks. Then it started to get crazy. Everyone was ordering tequila for each other and placing random shots of Wray and Nephews into the mix just to throw us off. We kept taking shots then slowed down and chugged a glass of rum and coke. Whoever was slowest took 3 shots so luckily it wasn’t me. 

Now we are about 2 hours into a 4 hours party and everyone is getting a bit crazy, people are drunk, people are getting handsy, some people are making out in the corner. I see this girl I’ve wanted to ask out for a while so I decided to shoot my shot and all went well: I’ve got a date this weekend! By this time I’m a little dizzy but nothing major. I start talking to a waitress and manage to get her name and number, although idk what I’ll be doing with them when I’m fully sober. 

We go back to drinking and have these passion fruit drinks, I think they’re called cocktails? We then go out to smoke some herb and come back crossfaded. I then pay for 6 shots: 2 for me and 4 for these other 2 people. The tab has run out so we’re all drinking pimms and drinks that are already out. I finally had a glass of red wine and I loved it. Our manager adds more money to make a larger tab so we all go crazy and order more shots and a couple Jagerbombs. 

The party ends and some of us go to a friends house to smoke and relax while playing video games and just vibing out. Stayed there until 5am and we all split up and went home. 

All in all, I had an absolutely fantastic night and I went from grimacing at every sip of alcohol to looking forward to the next time I go out to drink. Great vibes, lovely atmosphere but idk how my wallet is feeling lmao. I just woke up and I’m surprised I don’t have a hangover, I just feel a little tired. I’ve got a shift starting in 2 hours so wish me luck!

All in all, here’s roughly what I drank:
12 shots (of tequila or Wray and Nephews)
2 passion fruit cocktails 
2 glasses of rum and coke
1 jäger bomb
1 glass of red wine 


We had a coworker pass out at the 2 hour mark and I never realised how much drinking makes you go to the toilet. Something else I’ve noticed, and I got told my some female coworkers, is that I’m a lot more extroverted and I do way better with girls because I’m actually pretty flirty and chatty when I’m not sober. I normally kinda set a boundary between me and my female coworkers and treat them respectfully so I never try to act flirty with them but it seems like they liked it idk."

I went to a bunch of doctors, no answers and a bunch of tests came back normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I asked everyone about their worst or most interesting drink and you guys blew my brother and I away with your responses! Today, I've got something special in mind. You see, on our podcast, we LOVE tormenting ourselves with strange new drinks, good, bad, and middling. So in that spirit, we looked through the extensive list you've all provided us, and put together some of the worst drinks that we could feasibly make for ourselves, and decided to let this sub vote on it. I'm going to submit the list of them and we would love it if anyone and everyone posted their top three choices. The three with most combined mentions/votes will be the featured drinks on our next episode that I lovingly dub ""The Saddest Hooch"" so, our top contenders, as submitted by this delightful sub, are...  


 1. Budlight and Chocolate Milk

&amp;#x200B;

 2. The Vodka and Artisional Ranch shot.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Coca-Cola with Wine

&amp;#x200B;

4. The Gorilla, a Brass Monkey with Orange Four Loko instead of orange juice (Yes we will crush Caffeine tablets into it)

&amp;#x200B;

5. A Malort Fizz

&amp;#x200B;

6. The Drunken Potluck (I'll mix like 10 leftover bottles I've got)  


7. The Bullfrog Cocktail (half-bottle of mountain dew, 2 Koolaid packets, and vodka to full)

&amp;#x200B;

8.  Jaegerita (A margarita with Jaeger)

&amp;#x200B;

9. The Death Rattle (Large Shotglass, 1 oz Whiskey, 1 Large dash hot sauce, fill with beer to rim)

&amp;#x200B;

If we get a good response this will not be the only time we'll post these up for voting. But for now, we'd love for you to decide out alcoholic fate!"

But like I said I barley felt drunk more buzzed then anything. So I’m wondering does that mean I can handle a lot of liquor cause I know some people get wasted off just one or two beers"
246,0,"Rum, whiskey and even brandy mix nicely with cola, you can even mix it with jägermeister or amaretto. The latter will even make it taste like cherry coke.

Gin and and tequila mix with OJ, and as for liqueurs, campari, peach schnapps, and again jäger.

255,0,"**COCKTAIL:**  ***THE TUXEDO No.2***

Personally, I love a good martini. Dirty, clean, dry or sweet, or even both which is considered by some the ""perfect martini"". This particular martini has a few variations since its inception in the 1880's. The cocktail is named after the Tuxedo Club in Orange County, New York, where as legend has it was first mixed. Tuxedo Park, the planned community where the club was built, is itself a derivation of the Lenape word *tucseto*.

Every so often I have to remind myself that this drink is still out there when an Absinthe tasting drink comes to mind. The gin tends to smooth the star anise to a more approachable substitute to the strong licorice blast. This cocktail is a regular go-to, often an easy answer when a bar’s cocktail menu seems too foreign or daunting, or perhaps when a certain 1960’s era TV show calls for throwback viewing parties. 

Genever could be used as a substitute, as could be most other types of gin, but an Old Tom really fits the ticket. Serve in a coup, martini glass, or Mrs. Charles favorite - the Nick &amp; Nora. Cheers.

The Tuxedo No.2

* 3 cl Old Tom Gin
* 3 cl dry  Vermouth
* 1/2 barspoon Marachino
* 1/4 barspoon  Absinthe
* 3 dashes orange bitters
* Stir all ingredients with ice and strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with a cherry and a twist of lemon zest. Enjoy."

265,0,"I wrote an argumentative essay in English class and thought I'd share some of my favorite supporting details from the argument that argues why the drinking age should be reduced in the United States.

""Once a person turns the age of 18 they are seen as an adult in the eye of the public and the U.S. judicial system. In other words, they are now legally responsible for themselves. Adults are supposed to be able to make their own decisions and do what’s best for themselves without the interference of laws that affected minors. But, even at 18 a person can not legally consume or purchase alcohol in all 50 states. But that same person can go and die for their country in a war or foreign country without ever consuming a drop of alcohol.""

I was never able to drink more than a glass of wine or eat and drink at the same time without feeling absolutely awful and running to the bathroom. My general tolerance has always been fairly average. Suddenly, over the last month or so, I can eat and drink, and have half a bottle of wine with food and still remain sober/only very slightly tipsy.

316,0,"Hello,

This is my first post on Reddit, I am not used to this platform or anything like this, I am usually surfing on 9gag posts and my English is not good.

I don't know about you people but when I drink everything starts to seem logical and kind of easy to understand for me.

Problems are not problems anymore, cause actually everything seems to have a solution, everything seems to be not that important at the end.

At this time while I am talking to you, I have 3500$ of debt for my tuition, which for some of you will seem like nothing but for a guy coming from a third world country living abroad and has a problem of excessive spending seems a lot.

I usually stress about my savings and other problems like love life, exams ( 25 years old but still doing my second master ) and other subtle problems, but when I drink I feel like nothing is that important after all, that my life is not that difficult nor that easy but it is something normal and I shouldn't stress about it.

The problem is that I want to feel this way everyday, cause i get the courage to actually work,study,exercise or in this case write a post in Reddit which I never did in my life before.

However, I am not seeking help or anything, I know that drinking too much is bad but I ust want to know or meet people who actually got how these things work, how to get from a drunk state of mind to an actual real state of mind where you feel and act without hesitation and shame as you are actually drunk. That's how I want to live my life, drunk but without alcohol.

I don't know if it is the right sub to post this, as I am new to this and also I will not post until I am drunk again ( or at least tipsy)."

325,0,"I (27, F) work in a restaurant/bar and we were open for the ball drop last night. 

We were doing a complementary toast of champagne and it was my job to pour the flutes and then pass them out to customers at tables and in our lounge. Employees were also permitted a glass, and so I poured one for myself and set it on aside on a counter by the kitchen that is easily accessible to guests walking to and from the bathroom.

When we did our toast, I was surprised that I was pretty drunk almost immediately. Not tipsy, but DRUNK. I drink regularly, working in the service industry, so I found this a little unusual, but still continued to shut down the restaurant, thinking it would wear off. I had eaten three full meals that day, and had been drinking water, which I know help alcohol absorption, but it didn't seem to be helping. 

Looking back on it, I should have said something, but everyone wanted to leave and head off to the last parties that were still going on. 

I remember being very loud (which I'm not normally) and having difficulty doing my closing paperwork. 

My boyfriend works at a bar down the road so myself and a few coworkers went to see him and wish him a happy new year (about an hour after I had had the champagne). I had a glass and a half of wine at his bar, but was feeling sick. 

At this point, I was borderline brown out. Very fuzzy, sort of fading in and out, and I think I was slurring a bit. I was also over tipping the staff (which I guess isn't awful, except I spent waaaay more money than I should have).

A few friends and I ordered a pizza to take back to their place. There I had maybe a half can of cider (I don't quite remember) and then I guess I passed out on the couch because I blearily woke up to my boyfriend getting me up to take me home. 

This morning I found a lot of (pretty tame) texts I don't remember sending and a weird hangover. 

It was very unusual, and honestly a little confusing. I never BLACKED out, which I know is a huge indicator of having your drink spiked, but I'm wondering if maybe something still happened? Does anyone have experience with this?

TLDR; I think I might have gotten my drink spiked, but didn't fully black out so I'm unsure. Looking for some advice."

336,0,"I’ve been drinking since I was 18 and I used to be really good at it, but lately over the years I’ve been drinking less (I’m 27 now) and when I drink it’s not hitting right, basically I don’t feel it one minute and then I drink some more and before I know it the room is spinning, I used to drink smaller amounts faster, like 3 shots at once and then be done and smoke some weed, is that better than waiting for each drink to kick in and under shooting it? I wanna get drunk but ensure that I don’t over-do it and get sick"

350,0,"So I don’t drink all that much, maybe like once a weekend with some friends. Whenever I do drink I find it hard to actually just get drunk- it’s rare in fact. A majority of the time I just feel groggy and get hot and I get the spins sometimes as well. It’s like I’m skipping the actual being drunk part and I just feel like crap. I don’t normally get the chance to eat before I drink either. Do I need to eat more before/while I drink? Or maybe is it because I am skinny and shorter? Any help would be appreciated, I’d like to actually get drunk and have fun with my friends and not just sit there and feel bad all night."

354,0,"So as not to feel time’s horrible burden that breaks you down and bows your shoulders one must get drunk without ceasing, but what with?  With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you choose.

And if you may find yourself on the steps of a palace..

Or the green grass of a ditch..

Or the bleak solitude of your room..

You are waking when drunkenness has already abated,

Ask

The wind,

The wave,

The bird,

The clock,

The star,

All that which flees,

All that which rolls,

All that which groans,

All that which sings,

All that which speaks..

Ask them what time it is.

And the wind,

The wave,

The bird,

The clock, 

The star

Will reply..

“It’s time to get drunk”

So that you may not be the martyred slaves of time!

Get drunk!

And never pause for rest,

Be it with wine,

With poetry,

Or with virtue,

As you choose.

374,0,"So the past 10+ years I’ve been drinking I was a normal drunk, even when I blacked out I would just get rowdy and obnoxious like everyone else. 

But starting mid 2018 my black outs have been turning into a huge problem. I LIE and it’s just not like a cute little lie. I act like I’m on drugs or I’m tripping on something. 

Out of humiliation I cut down drinking but there are times where I forget and once I black out it the lies start happening. 

I get so embarrassed that I don’t see my friends for anyone for a period of time. 

I’m too scared to even go out to get drinks at HH with my coworkers 

Things I’ve lied about:
- I sacrificed myself for everyone from an exploding sun
- Everyone is trying to kill me (and I ran away until my brother came and found me and picked me up)
- that my dad is in the mafia and that he is trying to ship me away
- that I was walking in the club and I got signal that someone was gonna bomb the place.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!
Is there a solution behind this? 
Do I need to see a therapist?!

390,0,So for a while now I have been hesitant to continue in a games story unless i have a buzz going. When I'm drunk I get more immersed in the game world and tend to focus more. i tend to grind or switch to a less story based game while i'm sober. The funniest part about this is most of the time when I drink I dont remember most of the story just bits and pieces.  I also do the same thing with season finales of shows. It's honestly added a lot of anxiety on top of something that should be a stress reliever. Is anyone else dealing with this sort of problem?

It’s nasty and I can’t eat properly for a few days. But when I drink tequila, derived from agave, I don’t get that feeling. I can or pinpoint what it is, all of the vodka is usually crappy grain vodka, obviously the cheap malt liquor too. It just tastes like rotten tobacco from smoking and grain."

429,0,"So I need some advice fellow reddit users:

I don't drink to much but this is my favorite drink. Consequently, by the time I get around to finishing the 750ml, the kick of the alcohol is gone. I know they come in sizes of 375ml and less, where would be the best place to buy those sizes. I tried looking at typical grocery and liquor stores but to no avail. I am aware they can be purchased online, but was hoping not to pay for shipping. If it is just simpler to find another drink at that size for relative prices I would also consider those too. Any help on this would be great."

My friend and I were drinking Vodka before going out. Shot after shot, I can remember we had 17 shots of Vodka. After driving (Uber) to a bar, we went to a club. It was almost as if I spawned at the club. I do not remember getting to the bar, but do remember walking to the club. After all was drunk and done. We all got back to the hotel and passed out. 

I then was the first one up the next morning, no headache, no pains, took a shower and felt great. Can anyone explain this?"
