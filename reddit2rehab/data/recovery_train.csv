1,1,"Hey reddit, 

I'm doing some personal research about recovery. 

If you could share what  you are recovering from and one/two hardest thing about recovery, I'd really appreciate it!"
2,1,"I got one year sober on March 15 and had my baby on March 17. I couldn‚Äôt pick up a chip on my birthday because of covid, I haven‚Äôt been going to meetings anyway since I found out I was pregnant. I feel like I worked hard and earned those first three months and then I feel like I put my energy into my pregnancy and forgot about recovery, it was easy to stay sober because I was so excited for this baby, it‚Äôs all I thought about. Now I feel like I didn‚Äôt truly earn a year sober. It took me four years in and out of AA and rehab to get here and I should be happy with the year that I‚Äôve had. And now that I‚Äôm not pregnant anymore I feel like I don‚Äôt have that same safeguard, not that I want to drink, I have a newborn I just want to sleep. But I‚Äôm not sure what to do with my recovery next, I‚Äôd like to be more active with it because I‚Äôd like to keep it but I don‚Äôt know how to go back to AA."
7,1,"Hi all,

I was a poly drug user, mostly stimulants and went through a period of weekly mdma use in my late teens early twenties. The drug use didn‚Äôt stop it just moved onto mephedrone and cocaine/ speed. 

I did 3 months clean but then one relapse at Xmas with coke and alcohol. 

So I‚Äôve done 6 months pretty much with one bleep. 

I‚Äôm expecting a few years to feel normal again but any tips or help would be appreciated because this depression feels like concrete. It‚Äôs always there and doesn‚Äôt move at all."
8,1,"I was two years clean off of meth. I sniffed it only ever for a year and a half, and was 2 fucking years clean. And I smoked it 3 times last night. 
I‚Äôm a fucking mess today and I just want a lil hootyhoo 
I fucking hate myself."

13,1,"So I'm a few days into my recovery and it feels like I've missed so much in my addiction and it's all hitting me like a ton of bricks like all of a sudden the world is in a pandemic all of a sudden I'm not a teenager anymore all of a sudden some of my friends are grown and have kids all of a sudden some of my best friends I used to use with are dead and I never even got to say bye.

What do I do with this feeling I feel like I've lost so much time I feel so panicky and sad and overwhelmed........"
14,1,"TL;DR at the bottom, sorry for the essay post

**WARNING**: this post will probably be long and I'm on about 2.25mg of Klonopin and about a quarter of a bottle of whisky and counting. 

Also, when i refer to my ""brother"" we are not related by blood, to keep this anonymous, i will not go into detail, but he was taken in by me and my mother as he was having trouble as his brother was moving out of state and he was a big brother to me, teaching me a lot from \~10-19, me being 19 when he moved back out with his girl back to his hometown. 

So I've been having trouble with going clean after years of use. I started using opiates when i was 13 after my first surgery. My brother asked for one of my Norco 10's when i was taking my meds as usual one night back when i was 13. I went, huh, i know my brother takes ecstasy and other drugs to get high, this must give you a nice high. I decided to take an extra pill or two, and that night i found out how great opiates were. I had a steady supply as my pain was still moderate to severe for a long time (60 10/325 Norco a month). Then one month, my mother got 200 Norco 10's from a friend that had a stock pile as he had cancer and only took a half here and there as he hated the side effects.

Fast forward two weeks, (14 at the time) that stash that was in the family safe i had access to went down to \~100. My mother went to take one and was shocked to see that she was half empty after only taking one when she first got them due to chronic undiagnosed stomach pain. She first came to me as she didn't want to go to my older brother as she didn't think he would do so, and i told her the truth. She would hide my meds and i would betray her trust and personal space by going through her room, deciphering the code to a key lock box to get into the closet the safe was in to get my pills. I would take 40mg regularly after my 90mg a day binge when i went through those 100 pills. 

My ex moved in to my parents place when we were 17/her18. We got into drugs hard, from norco's and her xans, to weed, we went to coke, and me to a gram of opium every 2-4 days and pills when i couldn't get the good stuff

That relationship lasted until about 19 or so, then i had my fourth and final surgery and was put on Oxycodone after no legit script for about a year. no more drugs beside occasional coke and mbox (30mg fent pressed oxys) binges. 

Finally went to NA two months ago and got a wonderful sponsor that I love. He's a great guy and went through opiate addiction himself, with multiple years clean, we talk almost every day and I've been going to at least 5 meetings, in person or on zoom, a week. I'm having so much trouble living without substances, mainly benzos like Alprazolam/Clonazepam and marijuana, bust most of all opiates in any form. 

&amp;#x200B;

How did you fellow addicts in recovery get past that stage of needing to use to cope? I meditate, not as much as i should, but when things get bad for the most part i turn to meditation, calling my support group, and focusing on video games and other hobbies like guitar. But it is so hard going from 8 years of use to getting completely clean. 

&amp;#x200B;

I OD'd two weeks ago after 21 days clean taking my normal fent press oxy dose, and was facing multiple felonies. The officer had this worried, sad look on his face and let me off telling me I had no criminal record, wasn't driving when i was found in my car, and that this experience was enough punishment and he hoped i learned from it. Definitely did, but i still struggle with getting through the day without wanting to just use and feel that warmth and that opiate hug i know so well to calm me down and get me through the day.

I'd take any advice, I know it's gonna be hell. I just don't know how to push through that hell to see the green pastures and beautiful life over the horizon. I have a position coming up for a new job despite the quarantine and the managers have spoken highly of me as i have supervisory and managerial experience for 1.5+ years at the company I'm currently employed at, that is not having any/very little work for me due to the quarantine, and due to the nature of our work.

I hope you're all doing well in your recovery, whether you're at 1 day or 20 years. Props to those looking to turn their shit around and rebuild their lives and relationships. I could really use some advice in the beginning of my recovery. It's such a 180 living without substances besides nicotine/cigarettes.

TL;DR: 8 years of drug abuse, 21y.o. Male. got into NA a month and a half to two months ago and struggling with transitioning to living clean. Looking for advice on getting clean and fighting the urge to get intoxicated to deal with emotions and life in general. Have a great sponsor and wonderful parents supporting me after stealing and lying to them over the years and generally causing hell for them. Looking for advice on how to fight these urges I've been giving into for the past 8 years, and to turn my life around and get myself on track."
16,1,"I'm in personal recovery for my eating disorders, no one else except my friend knows I have it ( I'm 13 ).

I've been purging since I was 6, before I even knew what it was I was addicted. As of today at 9pm after I've finished my dinner, I haven't purged in a month. Recently I've been restricting my calories down to 400 the highest this month being 700. Yesterday I ate 1,181 calories and today 1,262. I'm so proud of myself even though I hated every second of it. I have no one in my friend circle to tell so I've come here, I'm so proud that I've come this far, especially while in isolation."
17,1,"Its beautiful out today.

When I first began experimenting, I started with ecstacy, then fell in love with coke, despite not really feeling much now that I think about it due to my adhd. I just always really like snorting things I guess.

Anyways, I began using in spring of 2011. So whenever I smell grilling outside and it's nice and sunny, I feel a bit triggered and long for the days I was a social butterfly with others just partying, doing drugs and having a good time.

22,1,"***Warning: In this post I speak about my feelings and about my negative thoughts, it might be triggering to some. Please consider before reading.*** 

I have only told about my feelings online, mostly in reddit. I find this platform as a place to get everything out of my chest. But today.. I'm just so scared. Background, so you can understand better:

I've always felt anxious. I remember being 5 or so, thinking what I will say, and how to say, so many times I couldn't remember that thought anymore. All my mistakes were corrected, and while that in itself is not bad, the fact that nothing I did was right was. Me being just 4-5, showing my mom something I drew was faced with criticism. Things I should correct, and I would just correct all those mistakes, to the point I was crying. If I would cry, I'd be told to stop, and that big girls don't cry like that, I'm soft and I should learn to take criticism.

 If I didn't understand something, I would not ask for help. If I needed help, I wasn't listening when it was explained, so therefore I was stupid. I was always a smart, calm kid. I felt so responsible to be the smart perfect daughter to get even something nice. Smart people had clean rooms and clean houses. My mom is a hoarder, there was rooms we couldn't get to go, because they were full of stuff. So clearly, I wasn't smart enough, my house wasn't clean.

But the comments wouldn't stop there. I remember being so young, and still always hearing ""Oh, look how cute and chubby you are!"",""Oh someone is hungry!"", ""You should lose some wight, train more to get your butt to be nicer!"", ""You should gain weight!"", ""Oh my god you're too skinny!"" ""I was even skinnier than you when I was your age, but with bigger boobs!"" I'm 5'8 and 145 lbs, but I hate everything about my body. I don't want to see it in the mirror, but still I constantly look at myself and find the flaws I must change, but not having anything to do that. I can't control my food or what my family buys, I can't control my exercise either.

That has been my life, between 4-16. I posted on another sub a while a go, and got comment of how I should seek help. But I can't. I would be less of a perfect daughter, and be like my mom when she was depressed. She has told me that story since I was 10. I want to be nothing like her, I can't have anything wrong with my mind. I couldn't live without my thoughts and the constant stressfull, anxious feeling. It just presses me down, and covers for me. It feels safe as it's all I've known. Not feeling anxious or doing everything like I always do makes me so scared. It's nothing like I've known, it's weird and I don't understand it. If I tried to get better everything would be taken from me, I could never be perfect or have friends or relationships. I should trust people. But it scares me so much, I just want to be left alone to cry. But crying and feeling like this makes me bad too, I'm not perfect. But this, I can hide from people, they'll never know about how I happen to feel. I hate pity, I don't want it at all. I'm not strong enough to do it on my own, but if I had to get someone to help me they wouldn't  do it because they care. They'd do it for pity, because I was in such bad condition. And because I'm young, it'd deemed as hormones and mood swings. It wouldn't be taken seriously if it wasn't for pity. I can't get that help. I don't want to leave everything I have known."

31,1,I have been struggling with ED for about 10 years. I am in treatment now working towards recovery. I am curious to know what peoples relationship with food is like that haven‚Äôt struggled with an eating disorder. Like do you think of food being good or bad or a treat. I just want to know what normal eating looks like or is it all a little disordered.
32,1,"I relapsed last week by drinking a bottle of cough syrup after being clean for 7 months. Things have gone downhill since. I smoked weed a few nights ago (something i haven't done in years), have been taking 2-3 kratom extract shots everyday, and taking 2-6mg of klonopin everyday. Ive been drinking a bit too. On top of that i picked up a ball of coke tonight. 
I havent told anyone and im so scared to tell my girlfriend. She's in a depressed mood as of now (not because of me) and i know she'd be so disappointed and angry. Im telling myself that this will be my last bag, but we all know how that goes. If i can stop after this bag i think everything will be okay and it'll be a huge confidence booster of my will power. It sounds dumb but thats my plan as of now. Can anybody give me tips on what they would do in my situation? I feel lost. I feel trapped in my guilt but terrified to reveal my bender to anyone."

34,1,"My drug of choice wasn‚Äôt alcohol; though there were a few times I didn‚Äôt control my drinking, it was still pretty normal. 

My DOCs were weed and ambien. I know I can‚Äôt do those anymore. 

Right now, it‚Äôs late at night and I wish I could just go upstairs and drink to fall asleep."
35,1,"I'm already getting interviews set up to get a job. I am listening to music and vibing out for the first time in two years. I'm watching TV shows like the last Airbender stoner off my ass. I can't stop laughing at everything in life and I feel so amazing. I am not having cravings for meth because I just can't stop smokiky this weed man it's amazing. 

I understand life now. I finally have remembered that I can smoke weed and be satisfied. This is such an experience you guys I feel like I have found my middle ground. I have quit the meth and embraced weed again and life is already working itself out. And best of all, I am peaceful. The war in my head that meth gave me has disappeared. It's so amazing ."
36,1,"In Rational Recovery, you learn to separate your thinking, higher, rational self from your Addictive Voice, or what Trimpey metaphorically calls ""The Beast."" The Beast is your animal midbrain. It is the part of your brain that wants only immediate pleasure ‚Äî drinking, drugging, eating, screwing ‚Äî with absolutely no concern for any resulting ethical breaches or long-term consequences. Although your Beast can't think, it has an astonishing ability to hijack your rational faculty and employ fallacious logic to get you to feed its destructive appetites. 

Here's how crafty and devious your Beast is. It can even take concepts that were designed to help addicts stay clean and sober and twist them into compelling excuses to drink or use. Talk about badass. Your Beast hears ""Addiction is a disease of relapse"" and tells you, ""See? You have a disease. Of course you're going to relapse. And if it's going to happen eventually, why not now?""

It should come as no surprise, then, that your Addictive Voice absolutely LOVES the current pandemic and all the resulting uncertainty. As soon as you saw that first news report, your Beast and the Coronavirus *instantly* became bosom buddies. 

See if any of the following Beast ploys sound familiar to you. 

* ""You're all alone, stuck in the house. It's a stressful time. Anyone would forgive you for relapsing now. They could be heartless not to. They don't know what it's like to be you.""

* ""Since you're now working from home, your boss won't know if you take a few shots or pop some Norco. It won't lead to a full-blown relapse or binge. But even if it does, you can regroup afterwards. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Besides, with the future so uncertain, what sense is there in looking too far into the future? You might lose your job in a week anyway. Meanwhile, why have a good time, or at least ease your suffering a little?"" 

* ""For God's sake, you've been laid off, your grandma could get the virus and croak at any minute, and now you can't even go to the movies or Starbucks to lick your wounds. You practically *deserve* a relapse under such insane conditions. Everyone says the coronavirus is a game-changer. No sense in ignoring cold hard reality.""

* ""You can't even physically get to your recovery meetings. Everyone knows if you stop going to meetings, relapse is inevitable. It's only a matter of time. Whenever someone in AA talks describes their relapse, they always say they stopped going to meetings in the preceding weeks or months. How can anyone expect you to work on your resentments and character flaws if you can't even go to meetings? When the pandemic is over and you have to explain your new sobriety date, sure, it'll be awkward. But they will understand. They know that addiction is a *disease*."" 

* ""You always told yourself if the world were about to end, all bets would be off and you might as well drink or use. Well, this could very well be the end. If not, it's something quite like it. Everything is in limbo. Could drinking really make things any worse at this point? Why not take advantage? 'Life is a cabaret, old chum!' 'Carpe diem!'""

* ""You are a Dual Diagnosis alcoholic ‚Äî a very special type of addict. Even your shrink and addiction counselor said so. You tend to self-medicate. Anyone who had your mental problems would do the same. It's well known that all this isolation and uncertainty is exacerbating people's anxiety and depression. No one could blame you for self-medicating at a time like this. Besides, if you don't self-medicate, you might spiral into depression and kill yourself. Relapsing is bad, but isn't it better than death? You have to look at the big picture here.""

* ""All these memes and jokes and videos of people drinking and using during the pandemic are triggering me. Science proves that triggers are a huge cause of relapse ‚Äî especially if you can't immediately run off to a meeting instead. Besides, why should all these other people get to drink or use while I have to endure my isolation and misery sober? It's not fair. Fuck it.""

Sound familiar? 

Always remember the definition of Addictive Voice:

""Any thinking or feeling that supports one's future use of alcohol or drugs.""

The way you deal with the Addictive Voice is to **recognize** that you are hearing your Addictive Voice, not your true, reasoning self. With this recognition comes power and objectivity. 

Use grammar to your advantage. Don't say, ""I am craving a drink."" Say, ""*You* are craving a drink."" Don't confuse your rational self with your animal brain. They are not the same. There are two of you. And you are the one in control. 

Above all, you **do not** engage in dialogue or deliberation or negotiation with your Beast. Many governments follow the policy, ""We do not negotiate with terrorists."" Your Addictive Voice is like a terrorist. It wants to bring your life crashing down like the World Trade Center, and for what? All for a couple of hours of artificial pleasure and relief. Don't get into long, agonizing conversations with your Beast. 

Remember: You don't negotiate with terrorists. 

Recognize Beast activity for what it is, reaffirm your Big Plan and your reasons for quitting, and then quickly move on to something more productive or healthy. It's that simple. Read a book. Listen to music. Watch a movie. Take a nap. Complete a task you've been putting off. Comment on a post (like this one!). You don't have to solve every character flaw or resentment or spiritual hole before you stay sober. No character flaw fan *make* you move your hand to pick up a bottle or syringe and put a substance in your body. Only *you* can. What will you do? 

Stay safe, everyone. And stay strong. You are in the driver's seat. It's up to you. Embrace the challenge. No one, not even your Beast, can stop you."

40,1,"I'm in very early recovery from anorexia and my closest friend, who knows about my eating disorder but very likely doesn't understand what would be a problem for someone with an eating disorder, said something in a group chat that set me back a bit. The message said, ‚ÄúI'm probably the only girl in the world to be happy about gaining 5-10 lbs (She then states her actual weight but I'm not putting that here).‚Äù Or something along those lines... i deleted the message from my phone. At first I felt angry because she knows more about my disorder than even my therapist probably does and I thought she should know better, but immediately afterwards I felt guilty because she's allowed to talk about her progress and meeting her goals and maybe I should just shut up and be happy for her. But I can't. We're the same weight now and she's taller than me and that's messing with me so bad. I want to cry almost because this happened right after I ate dinner and now I feel so disgusting. I want to say something to her but I don't want to be rude, she's proud of gaining weight and that's wonderful and I don't want to cheapen her pride by making her feel bad for me.

42,1,"So I have been experimenting with weed in place of meth. I remember back when I first started weed I was pretty happy and felt okay using it on a daily basis. When I switched to meth I started to use it everyday and smoked weed rarely after that. 

I am recovering from meth and I've been having pretty bad cravings for it and I was also trying to stay sober from weed. But eventually I have gone back to the meth as I've struggled with my cravings for it.

But currently, I am smoking weed as much as possible. I have been smoking it as much as I used to when I first started and I'm feeling great.

When I get cravings I just smoke weed until they go away and I am left not even caring about the meth anymore. I have barely been thinking about using again. 

I hope this weed experiment works because so far nothing else has worked."

She's looking for another meeting to attend during the day, and it looks like all our local meetings are being hosted through Zoom.

First thing we did together was read the first chapter together over the phone. He told me to think about how mine and Bill's story relate. Since I have nothing much to do I just wrote a little homework for myself in a blog, a throwaway account, but yea. How is everyone keeping it together? I have been to AA many times before but just because of court, Never really surrendered and admitted to myself  until now, I am an alcoholic..... anyways I will copy and paste what I wrote. Feel free to give me pointers about early sobriety or whatever....Thanks.

 

**We admitted we were powerless over alcohol ‚Äî that our lives had become unmanageable.**

How is Bill‚Äôs story and mine similar? How does it relate to me?

Bill‚Äôs story begins when he was 22 years old and was in the military during the first world war. In that respects we are totally two different people grown up in different times and places. I a first generation immigrant and he a veteran. As different our backgrounds may have been our ailment, what we believed to be an affinity to alcohol, is a story of filled with cautionary tales from the first instance alcohol touched our lips. Yet we failed to heed warnings signs alike and just as much fun as it was in the beginning at the end brought nothing but pain, suffering and loss, hurting those we love most, causing us to question our own sanity.

My first drink, I was 17 years old I believe a senior in high school. I was at a community party with my father. I remember my friend and I sneaking out to hang outside with the older kids and we were hanging around a liquor store. My first drink of liquor peppermint snaps if I am not mistaken. WE hung around outside and we were drinking. Next thing you know I am back home, its morning, my head spinning feeling sick to my stomach and I was just stuck in bed. I had blacked out and I was scared of what was to come next from my father. The only thing I remember him saying to me was,‚Äù Do you remember what you were doing at the party,‚Äù and he left and said ‚ÄúDo not tell your mother this will kill her.‚Äù Maybe I knew it then and there, if not then certainly thought about it many times in the future. Why? Why? Why would I do anything like that ever again that it makes me so sick, not remember, and act a fool of myself?

That was my first experience with alcohol and not my last. Over the years I will have a lot of time to practice and get my doctorate in how to be in alcoholic, like Bill I will find myself hopeless and in despair. The drink, it‚Äôs a funny thing. We go to it when we are happy, sad, mad, alone, day, evening, or evening night! Cunning, powerful and baffling.

Throughout Bill‚Äôs story he shares his turmoil he tells of stories losing job after job and moving place to place. Even having brief periods of sobriety to get his shit together just enough to have hope, and time after time just throw it away. Asking himself why cannot just will himself not to drink. Is he not strong enough? Opportunity after opportunity he squandered away: law school, wall street, his friend from Montreal. Until brought to the brink of insanity. He and all his friends and family thought he would end up dead soon enough or taken away to an insane asylum.

Now I was not a daily drinker, alcoholics come in many types. Me I was a binge drinker who liked to socialize, and socialize I did. Maybe even considered myself a problem drink who was just unlucky. Why was I always getting caught drinking and driving? I quit drinking and been forced to go to A.A and get my paper signed many a times by a judge. But me an alcoholic. Never in my life would I have thought that!

 Well I have had my share of fun; this has been fun no more. 36 years old I have multiple DUI‚Äôs. I have started and stopped many a times. Showed discipline, promise, potential in so many other areas in my life. Potential ‚Äî ‚Äúhaving or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future.‚Äù You can only have potential until you just are what you are‚Ä¶.! I am just another alcoholic! I am powerless and it has definitely made my life unmanageable. Lord please help me and give me the strength. This month was the first time I have finally admitted to myself, even said it aloud to a group of people. I am still very fortunate to be alive and even have a chance at recovery. Many are not so lucky and not with us today! Yes, I am an alcoholic, and I will be until the day I die. I am learning that now and so much more in such a short time. I know that I don‚Äôt know shit, I am fortunate enough in these tough times and even more fortunate after all my mistakes and fuck ups that I still have a family that cares and loves me. That I have even more to lose today than I have ever had in my entire life. Yes, I am powerless over alcohol and my life has become unmanageable.

45,1,"I am three years free of a cocaine addiction (yay)! 

I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself since it was such a fast spiral into a regular use and it becoming horribly damaging. It took some major support systems to keep me in check and kind of some guilt checking because I did feel bad for getting as caught up as I did. I am happy being free however;

I am not clean of everything. I still drink and take other drugs like adderall (which, is basically baby cocaine - I do not take it regularly) and trazodone and a recent favorite? Ativan. I‚Äôm feeling really down right now. It‚Äôs 5am and I have spent thirty minutes looking at pictures of the very drug I did manage to kick. It was by far the most damaging to my life but I still use other substances to deal with life and sometimes it feels pointless to stay away from just this one. 

All that aside, I‚Äôm not going to make the jump back into that hole but I definitely did need to vent. Recovery is hard and I am thankful there are so many stories here and positive comments to read to help encourage growth for myself and my future. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

47,1,Is this a good idea? Obviously nothing else has been working and I keep smoking the damn meth! I figured well hey back than i use to smoke weed and that was enough for me at the time. I don't see why I can't just go back to smoking weed and trying to be satisfied with it again that way?
48,1,"I am so ambivalent about this drug. I keep going back and forth to wanting to use and than wanting to stay sober. But in the long run I eventually come back to the drug (meth) and use it again. But than I regret it and than stay sober for a while. 

Is this an issue in my recovery process? How do i fix it and stay motivated."
51,1,"I basically have been obsessed with one of my closest guy friends for about four years. We hooked up one night about a year ago and confessed that we had always had feelings for each other. From there We dated for about six months until he ended it. We didn‚Äôt see each other often when we were dating and he was very emotionally unavailable and it wasn‚Äôt a healthy relationship. But I was madly in love with him. 

We were both alcoholics and active in our addiction together. I‚Äôm sober now, he is not.  In fact he broke up with me a few days after I got sober. 
I know why we can‚Äôt be together, I know he isn‚Äôt sober. We broke up six months ago and I just feel like I can‚Äôt move on. I still cry regularly over him and think about the relationship more frequently than I would like to. 
Since getting. Sober I have made so many positive changes but this mental obsession is hanging on. I‚Äôm devastated. And I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt break the spell. 

I miss having him as a friend and I miss being with him in a romantic way too. I also just know he‚Äôs lost to alcoholism and miss him as a person. He isn‚Äôt the same as he was when we first met, alcohol has taken him, and it‚Äôs heartbreaking. 

I feel like this is a peice of my recovery that I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt just let him go. It has gotten better but it feels so hard still, and It‚Äôs making me mentally exhausted. 

I thought about posting this in r/relationships but this somehow felt more appropriate. 
I just needed to get it off my chest. Thank you"
52,1,"I am fighting a battle with my addiction to meth. I am putting so much work to stay sober and to recover and I don't crave it for the most part. I was sober for a few days, but last night I had a dream I was using and it was so vivid and amazing I woke up missing it so badly. I went to my friends house and used immediately after that. I couldn't handle my craving for that life again it was torture. 

I have been to two different rehabs and they both discharged me before I finished treatment because I was having psychotic episodes and was talking to myself. They both said they don't know how to treat me and they don't want me to come back.

I need to go back to rehab and actually finish treatment I have been led astray by these centers and they won't accept me back and they never helped set me up with outpatient resources.

I am not sure what to do. My mental health is really not good right now and I still see things and have weird ideas that make me unable to get a job. I just want to get better which is why I went to rehab but it's obviously not working.

I am at a loss here. I'm losing my battle with addiction and really don't know what to do. I am back home and using again and I just want to give up because I don't know what to do next. What do I do?"

61,1,Who else is working from the smart recovery handbook? It really motivates me to stay sober. Even though I relapsed a couple days ago I really learned on this book to remind me of why I am fighting my disease of addiction and I feel like I am back on track with my recovery! It's all thanks to the book.
62,1,"I hate myself for writing this post but I need to know if anyone feels the same or I‚Äôm just slightly vile. 

Basically, I had been clean for 5 months and then relapsed and now I‚Äôm in the grey area where I‚Äôm not clean but I don‚Äôt necessarily get high/drunk (e.g. I took my mum‚Äôs prescribed Xanax for anxiety, I drink wine at dinner). Anyways, being 5 months clean and collecting all the NA key rings was amazing. It was a shame I relapsed. 

Ever since, I have issues going to NA. I feel so bad comparing myself to others who are successful in their recovery. I can‚Äôt really stand everybody collecting their new key rings whilst I had lost everything. I know it sounds childish and horrible because trust me I really wish everyone the best and it‚Äôs amazing that people are managing to recover but I feel so fucking bad about myself!!! 

When I relapsed and was in a horrible state (bad event happens), my friend, who was ‚Äòbehind‚Äô me in her recovery, sent me a pic of her 30 days key ring and started saying how happy she is in her recovery. I had to say ‚Äòcongrats‚Äô but i was in so much pain and so triggered. I feel bad I can‚Äôt be happy for my friends and NA fellows. I wish them the best, but seeing them progress makes me feel disgusting and I feel like recovery is not even worth is since I‚Äôm so ‚Äòbehind‚Äô everyone. I know it‚Äôs not the truth and relapses happen but because of this I had to stop going to NA because each meeting would make me more depressed, which increased my urges to do drugs (which I didn‚Äôt tho). I feel helpless. 

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this was but I feel bad being triggered by other people‚Äôs successful recovery stories because i feel disgusted with myself and the fact that I relapsed. Does anyone else have it???? Ugh I feel worthless"
63,1,Was moved from gop back to iop today because i missed our zoom meeting was told as long as i can get a job and negative ua's I'll move back up i lost my serving job just before covid 19 went nuts and the only places hiring near me or away from me are retail places i have 7 retail theft charges on my record and restaurants aren't open... I've stacked the cards against myself but holy shit this is making it hard to stay sober especially with isolation being a requirement given current social happenings

When I discharged they told me to come back in three days so I returned home thinking I was only going to be here for two more days.

I used again thinking eh what the hell might as well since im going back to rehab. 

After I used they literally called me afterwards saying they are unable to treat me and that I am not allowed back in because they simply aren't equipped to treat me.

I don't know what to do now I was supposed to get set up with sober living and now that's canceled and I'm back home and used again.

I am already struggling so bad with my addiction I just wish I was dead and didn't have to deal with any of this. I wish I didn't have to live this stupid fucking life with my addiction. I am so scared I won't be able to make it through this I truely just want to be dead."
76,1,"At about this time 10 years ago I was roaring over a midwestern highway on my way back from a casino at which I'd blown money I didn't have, high on a trio of substances. I went into rehab the next morning, something I'd been planning for weeks and weeks.

Ten years later, my sobriety is intact. So much of my life has changed. A lot was left behind, some of which I'm still terribly sad over. There were close calls and deep emotional and psychological valleys. But I'm here today, listening with a clear head to the night noises outside, reflecting on what ten years of sobriety has wrought, and excited by the prospect of where another ten might lead.

One day, sometimes one moment, at at time. You can find your way through."

 I used to think I would be going to NA for years, but now I don‚Äôt think feel the need to go after 1 year. Something about saying that feels wrong, but feels right with me. I don‚Äôt feel a need to use, have a great friends/family support group, and lots of friends from treatment. My SO is extremely supportive as well.

I recently realized that my anxiety is FAR worse than I ever thought. I suppose I was self medicating with alcohol.

Since I‚Äôve been sober, I have taken klonopin two or three times in moments of severe distress/panic but it‚Äôs not something I would like to continue doing, as benzos are obviously addictive (though they were never my drug of choice and I had never even used any until after I got sober, and like I said, only in times of severe distress.) 

I‚Äôm looking for non-addictive alternatives that can calm me down similarly to the way klonopin does (almost immediate relief from chest pains, hyperventilating, pounding heart, shortness of breath, etc.) 

Anyone have any suggestions? Ive been trying meditation and exercise, but it doesn‚Äôt give me relief to the degree klonopin does. Anything specific I should ask my doctor about? She has mentioned SSRIs, but I don‚Äôt get along with those very well. 

Thank you!"
90,1,"Hi everyone, I've never been on this sub before but I just assumed it had to exist, and thankfully it does. I am an opiate addict who has struggled with addiction for around 8 years now and I've begun taking the steps to get clean again. The problem I've had each time I get clean is that I don't commit to or even ever join any sort of treatment/counseling/therapy group(s). It's never been because I don't want to. It's actually all that I've ever wanted; however, I live in Baltimore and so the MAT clinics here don't offer any sort of worthwhile programs and all of the typical programs around here just aren't well suited for me (or really anyone younger (i'm 25)). Plus, I'm in no way able to afford any sort of typical treatment options really. Luckily, I was accepted onto a grant program for MAT treatment at my local clinic. But I need to take this further and actually start with counseling or therapy or something to do it right this time.   


  
So, long story short, I was hoping that some people here might know about any sort of online programs, whether it's drug counseling/therapy specific, even just broad therapy/psychiatry, outpatient, etc... I've always wanted to find an online option for things like this, especially now with the whole mess that our country and the world is in. So yeah, please share with me any and all suggestions, experiences, resources, etc. for any sort of online treatment programs, apps, etc. that you might know about.

Have a plan to give up work end of may (already told them) and finally turn my back on the corporate bullshit world. 

Then go to a detox clinic.

Don‚Äôt want 12 step rehab (been there) just detox with medical assistance. 

Then I may take myself off for 1-12 months on some sort of, maybe mountain, adventure where I have no access to drugs and work out who I am without them and how I can live without them. 

From June I will have left the corporate world for good and when I get back from detox / adventure - get some sort of job that ‚Äòhelps‚Äô and volunteer until I do. 
I‚Äôm fortunate that due to being a corporate whore, I‚Äôm ok for money.

94,1,"Don't give up.

If you've been going through alot and it seems like its very difficult for you to get over your burdens in life, I'm here to tell you that it is going to get better.

You don't have to give up. You don't have to drown in your problems. Your problems are weightless and you don't physically have to carry them. 

We don't tend to realize just how much we've accomplished when were so focused on the difficulties we face. You have thousands of accomplishments. You've encompassed so much experience in the many years that you have lived. The universe does know and does take notice. It is non judgemental. The universe is always rooting for us and it gives us signs if we really pay attention. It guides us in the right directions when we are lost. 

Your team is amazing because your team is selected specifically for you. If you havent already met or recognized the members of your team in life.. just know theyre out there waiting to meet you but they know it not. Its destined to happen and its inevitable. We all come to this planet with our team. Thats why soulmates exist and they dont all just mean lovers but teachers friends guides and actors all playing significant roles in our lives. Thats why we're born to  specific parents and under specific circumstances.

You're not in this alone. You got the whole world and you also got your own personal team. 

So put your head up, bring your shoulders back, adjust your posture .. anytime you're feeling down or pessimistic, because you gotta remember, your capabilities as a human are enormous and endless. 

Life is a journey, a marathon, and not a race. There's no giant boulder tumbling behind you. Theres no life meter. Theres not only 3 retries. Theres no inserting coins to continue. There is absolutely no limit on how many times you can get back up from being knocked down. 

Every champion or accomplished person who is revered and even those who aren't have taken more losses in life than we can imagine. We dont see how much they've suffered.. we see only a fraction of what they endured.

And you know what? The harder the challenges, the greater the rewards. That is, if you don't give up. 

So go out there, regain your personal power and conquer those obstacles that are preventing you from living your best life. You don't have to carry the whole mountain, break that shit down and carry every rock, carry whatever size rock you want first. And if any rock is too big, break that shit down even more and carry the small rocks first. Just know by the end you're moving mountains.

No matter what, you got something in you thats powerful. Something that makes you unique to the world. Theres only one of you and there can never be a duplicate. You are one of a kind. And theres a fire burning within you. Light that shit up even more and burn baby burnnnn! You are a fireball!

You got this."
95,1,"I've been with my bf for 8 yrs. He and his ex have a son together who is almost 18. 

I love my bf's ex to pieces, and in recent years she was addicted to pills (painkillers). She told me she pulls at the sides of her hair (like the sideburns) when she's ""tweaking"" (her words). When I met them all 8 yrs ago, she was a bigger woman, size-wise...she wasn't ""obese"" but...you know what I mean. She's dwindled down to about 75 lbs it looks like. 

Almost 2 yrs ago, she pulled all her hair out, had to have it shaved to look better and has worn hats ever since. She got off the pills for quite a while and started to finally put some weight on her. Now, she's acting antsy again and pulling her hair again. I think she's on meth, tbh. 

When she was in the throes of battling her pill addiction a few yrs ago, I told her that if she felt that ""urge"" to come out and hang out with me. My bf wasn't keen on the idea, but I told him to SHUT UP. 

Now, I think she's back on something, and I don't know what. She will not say and will not admit anything now. I love my bf and his son to pieces and I care about this woman who was a part of their lives for a long time. I want to help her. I invited her to come out and spend time with me this weekend, share a bottle of wine, and listen to some old record albums. I'm hoping by doing that that I can get her to SAY something to me. I'm thinking if she's with me for a few hrs just to hang out, too, that she won't use any drugs and any ""urge"" will pass. 

My bf doesn't think it's a good idea, tho. Their son is now dating a girl and their son is embarrassed of his own mother. I can keep them all away from each other. I want to do this for ""K"" and help her. I want to do the right thing. My bf says I should talk to their son and see what his plans are this weekend with his own girlfriend before inviting ""K"" to hang out with me. 

She won't admit now that she's back on drugs, even tho it's obvious. I want to sincerely help her. I love my bf and their son to pieces and I adore ""K"" to pieces as well because she's a big part of their lives. I respect that. She's a good woman. Her older brother O.D.'ed a few yrs before I met them all...I do NOT want to see that happen to her. Plus, that would devastate my bf's son and I think also my bf. 

HOW can I help? What can I do without coming across to her as invasive. Like I said...she and I get along GREAT. We always hug each other and look out for each other. 

I just want her to be okay."

Don't give up.

If you've been going through alot and it seems like its very difficult for you to get over your burdens in life, I'm here to tell you that it is going to get better.

You don't have to give up. You don't have to drown in your problems. Your problems are weightless and you don't physically have to carry them. 

We don't tend to realize just how much we've accomplished when were so focused on the difficulties we face. You have thousands of accomplishments. You've encompassed so much experience in the many years that you have lived. The universe does know and does take notice. It is non judgemental. The universe is always rooting for us and it gives us signs if we really pay attention. It guides us in the right directions when we are lost. 

Your team is amazing because your team is selected specifically for you. If you havent already met or recognized the members of your team in life.. just know theyre out there waiting to meet you but they know it not. Its destined to happen and its inevitable. We all come to this planet with our team. Thats why soulmates exist and they dont all just mean lovers but teachers friends guides and actors all playing significant roles in our lives. Thats why we're born to  specific parents and under specific circumstances.

You're not in this alone. You got the whole world and you also got your own personal team. 

So put your head up, bring your shoulders back, adjust your posture .. anytime you're feeling down or pessimistic, because you gotta remember, your capabilities as a human are enormous and endless. 

Life is a journey, a marathon, and not a race. There's no giant boulder tumbling behind you. Theres no life meter. Theres not only 3 retries. Theres no inserting coins to continue. There is absolutely no limit on how many times you can get back up from being knocked down. 

Every champion or accomplished person who is revered and even those who aren't have taken more losses in life than we can imagine. We dont see how much they've suffered.. we see only a fraction of what they endured.

And you know what? The harder the challenges, the greater the rewards. That is, if you don't give up. 

So go out there, regain your personal power and conquer those obstacles that are preventing you from living your best life. You don't have to carry the whole mountain, break that shit down and carry every rock, carry whatever size rock you want first. And if any rock is too big, break that shit down even more and carry the small rocks first. Just know by the end you're moving mountains.

No matter what, you got something in you thats powerful. Something that makes you unique to the world. Theres only one of you and there can never be a duplicate. You are one of a kind. And theres a fire burning within you. Light that shit up even more and burn baby burnnnn! You are a fireball!

You got this."
105,1,"My boyfriend and I visited my brother and his family last night. My little brother, who is a recovering addict, tagged along. He is 22 and insists on drinking with us which is an uncomfortable situation bc I‚Äôd really rather he didn‚Äôt drink - I know it likely makes the probability of him relapsing soar through the roof. Nonetheless, I don‚Äôt stop him or address it really. He seems to have been clean for over a year - it‚Äôs so hard to know... But he lives with family and I know it‚Äôs pretty impossible to hide meth use. Anyway, my boyfriend woke up in the middle of the night last night and observed some weird behavior my brother was displaying. Boyfriend recorded it to showed me in the morning, as I was asleep. I‚Äôve seen my brother coming down from use before and the behavior in the video was not nearly as extreme but it definitely makes me heart race watching it because it really seems off. If I post the video to my page, can somebody help me identify if it just seems like drunk behavior or if there is something else going on? I want to post it briefly and then delete it as it is a very sad and private situation."
106,1,"Alabama has higher opioid prescriptions per capita than any other state. Why are so many opioids being prescribed?

It's a tough balance for prescribers. No one wants to undertreat legitimate pain. It's tricky trying to discern the difference between 1) someone who is asking for more pain meds because they are in legitimate pain, 2) someone who is asking for more so they can be in no pain, and 3) someone who has become addicted to pain medication (someone who needs help and would benefit more by referral to dextox/rehab recovery than from further use).

When patients think 'experiencing no pain' is the goal of treatment, they will take the medication they are prescribed regardless of whether it's just enough or too much. If it's not enough, obviously asking for more should be an option, just not the only one. Either way, the goal for these patients is NOT to feel pain. They will take the opiates offered until all the pain is gone, whether they are taking the prescribed amount or taking more because they feel it's not enough. Once the pain is gone, they are at risk inadvertently physically hurt themselves, sometimes to the point of requiring elevated intensity of care or longer term care. All this because they are trying to address the issue with medication alone. The risk of further injury and overdosing oneself on pain meds are part of why pain management care providers will tell you that 'being in no pain' is NOT a reasonable goal for the treatment of painful conditions FOR ANYONE who is not in palliative care.

Without fully comprehensive pain management including different types of treatment (like physical therapy, heat and cooling treatments, TENs, and many other non-opioid pain relief methods) some patients become or choose to remain unaware of how or why their bodies are in pain because it's fully masked by the medication. Many patients on long term opiates that would benefit from the addition of these other methods to their pain management regimen feel that physical therapy and other non opiate pain management solutions are not necessary or won't work for them at all because they're so used to being prescribed opiates 'because they work best' by blocking out the feeling of pain altogether, immediately, and without any pretense to how or what is causing the pain, nor how to work to prevent it in the future.

Patients get overprescribed medication so they can get through rough times when perhaps they have a legitimate injury on top of their chronic pain (or some other new painful development), but more often than not, the doctors who raised the dose to compensate for this choose not to dose patients back down after allowing a reasonable recovery time after these incidents. For most people, taking more = fewling better, so they tell the doctor that, and the doctor agrees to keep them on the higher dose, not just because it keeps the patient happy but because they don't want to undertreat pain and DOSING DOWN CAUSES PAIN. It does not matter who you are, tapering down from use of any addictive substance is risky business.

Simply put, opiates (potentially addictive pain medications) work by changing the body and mind's reaction to pain. Withdrawal is what occurs when someone taking opiates is taken off them, or experiences a dose decrease. Withdrawal happens because the mind and body need time to adjust back to trying to manage pain without the help of the opiate medication that was 'hiding' the true extent of the pain that was really going on. Because pain can be so intense, withdrawal can also be excruciatingly painful, especially when done too quickly or ""cold turkey."" When using proper tapering methods, though, withdrawal can reduced to an uncomfortable experience, at the very least. Proper tapering allows the body to adjust back to being without opiates, but in cases, again, the goal of dosing down would be to a level of managable pain such that the patient can function fairly easily in their day to day life, and never with the goal being to remain pain free every day. Of course, happily, some injuries do heal and bodies do adjust such that many people don't find the need to remain on pain medications indefinitely.

The prescribing issues still stand, however, and patients who aren't properly informed of the risks of taking high dose opiates or long term ones are at a high risk of remaining overprescribed the medications. One overarching pattern when doctors do appropriately dose down patients after injuries (or disease state flare ups), for example, is that patients will feel dissatisfied with their care ANY time their opiates are dosed down. The body and mind have to be given time to adjust to the changes in pain perception that happen during tapering. Since that isn't exactly common knowledge, it takes a knowledgeable doctor's careful explanation to allay the concerns of tapering patients. Unfortunately, this puts doctors in an uncomfortable position, too. Most people don't want to 'feel bad' while their bodies re-adjust, honestly, who would? The paroxysmal circumstances that to feel better you might feel worse for awhile ate enough to send most patients packing at the prospect, despite the doctor's assertion that dosing down is the safer method (being on low doses, for less time, or not taking opiates at all significantly reduces the risk of death by overdose, misuse and abuse of the medication). Many patients choose to leave the care of prescribers who actually warn them of these risks in search of someone who will prescribe them what they know works, opiates, the immediate release from pain in the form of a prescription. So what's a doctor who knows all this full well supposed to do? Do they dose down and risk losing a patient, or do they just agree to keep the higher dose that the patient (and potentially addicted person) wants to be on?

Patients expect to ideally be without pain....but thinking that the goal is to feel no pain can quickly lead to patients taking more cumulative doses of opiates than they should be on a regular basis, and at some point the goal of 'feeling no pain' becomes a new goal of 'feeling euphoric' and that, in my opnlinion, is where addiction can begin for anyone on these meds regardless of natural propensity toward addictive behaviors. That elusive goal of continual euphoria is, in essence, what all addiction chases after, isn't it?
Many people on opiates long term may need them, just maybe not for as long as they think, or at doses higher than is reasonable based on their individual situation. I just think it's important to ask questions. Inform yourself and others. Just because a doctor prescribes you something that makes you feel better when you're hurt, doesn't mean you need the crutch and risk of addiction that come with taking it long term. High doses and long term use are the biggest risk factors for becoming addicted and for overdose, which can be fatal. Take responsibility for your health and the health of those you love, if something seems off, talk to your doctor, talk to people you trust. HEALTH should remain the focus of the healthcare industry, not curing pain with euphoria.


Afterword:

FYI Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (the insurer fir around 40% of Alabamians) is taking more steps each year to keep patients from being RXed opioids on the insurance company's dollar without sufficient medical reasoning. Last year (continuing to present day) all opioids prescribed for over 7 days in a row require an additional authorization request from the MD office. This year, they're kicking it up a notch and asking MDs for specific rationale for why each patient who is taking over 300mg morphine equivalent dosing a day is on such a high cumulative dose before allowing insurance to cover the medications/doses going over that limit. The idea is to get MDs thinking about how long they need to RX opioids and how much is really clinically appropriate for each patient based on their conditions and individual pain management needs."

120,1,"TW: self harm

I will start by saying that I absolutely love this subreddit. Everyone seems so supportive, which is probably why I‚Äôm posting here. More than anything, I need to get this off my chest but I also wanted to share that I‚Äôm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in a while!

I‚Äôve had a harming issue for around 6 and a half years now. I‚Äôve been clean for the last year - I‚Äôve done really well at keeping myself together and making positive steps in the right direction. I left my abusive partner, started taking care of myself and in general I am proud of my progress.

Harming for me was always a coping mechanism for when things got bad enough for my other methods to not work. Quitting has been a lot of work, and it‚Äôs typically not until things start to get bad again that I realise how much I‚Äôve relied on it in the past.

With that said, things are getting bad again. I‚Äôve been having a number of health problems, my number and quality of friendships are rapidly declining and I don‚Äôt feel I have the support network that I need. This week has been particularly rough: 4 doctors visits in 3 days, and a run-in with aforementioned abusive partner. Seeing them (for the first time since I left, might I add) has made me feel like I‚Äôm trapped back in the mental place I was in when we were together - and that was a really rough time for me.

I‚Äôm struggling to cope with all of this healthily. However, I can finally see my recovery coming through!

I am aware that I won‚Äôt feel like this forever. It might take a very long time, but some day I‚Äôm going to stop feeling worse and start feeling better. I also know that harming won‚Äôt help me feel any better, or magically fix my problems. It‚Äôs not much to cling on to (and it‚Äôs hard to believe sometimes!) but it‚Äôs something and for that I am grateful.

It‚Äôs really nice to feel like I‚Äôm making progress, even when things are rough. Anyway, rant over and thank you for your time. Best of luck with everything, dear reader :)"
121,1,"Hello there everybody! I‚Äôve been a long time stalker of this page and I want to finally open up about my story. Bare with me here but seriously read because it could literally save your life. 



So for the last 4 years or so, I‚Äôve had some major depression, shit it could‚Äôve even been my whole life who knows. I barely remember my childhood, but I digress. 



Anyway, about a year after my depression i met this guy let‚Äôs call him Cameron. So it was my sophomore year first day at a new school and he introduced himself. 



We made an instant connection and were tight homies. That same first conversation he asked me if I‚Äôd ever smoked weed.



I said of course, but I never really felt anything from it.
He told me I must not be doing it right and he was right i wasn‚Äôt. I smoked a year earlier with my best friend (I wasn‚Äôt inhaling right) whose death weeks ago led to my overdose story I‚Äôm going to be explaining later on. 



So Cameron and I smoked for the first time in my car and hotboxed. My first time I was kinda over amazed how fucking cool everything was. Like I enjoyed it so much I was literally tweaking and rubbing all over my body just feeling like I‚Äôm on a different plant. So after that you probably guessed it me and him smoked everyday after. 



That lasted about 1-2 months of smoking weed and classic shenanigans and trouble with law enforcement as well. But I don‚Äôt have time to go into that lol. Anyway so then he tells me about ecstasy, when he described it it sounded amazing and I definitely wanted to try it. 



But everyone who has a good first MDMA experience will tell you it‚Äôs the best feeling in the world. It really is. I didn‚Äôt get addicted to it at all bc i already did the research and knew it wouldn‚Äôt be the same unless you wait awhile. So I said eh forget it; which is what I should‚Äôve done with the oxy.. 



It was the summer after my sophomore year in high school and we went to visit my grandparents. Me; being an instant addict and not even knowing it; went to search their room for pain medication bc I remembered Cameron told me a lot of people he‚Äôd take medications from and they get you feeling really nice. 



So I literally found a junkie Jesus moment and scored over 150 10mg oxy/acetaminophen. I took about 3 pills and instantly loved how it made my feel. Like all my problems now didn‚Äôt exist and I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù so a few days go by and I‚Äôm poping maybe 3-5 pills a day. Then next week it goes to max of 7-8 a day. 



Okay I need to speed this story up cuz it‚Äôs a long one sorry guys lol but let‚Äôs say a year and a half goes by. No oxy, just weed daily. Suddenly a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù hits me up and says he has some 7.5 percs. My mouth instantly watered and RIGHT there RIGHT fucking then I should‚Äôve know trouble was coming. 



I learned how to use the dark web and starting order random things at first xans, coke, meth, lsd, shrooms you name it. I made it my goal to try everything because I felt I deserved it. I was lying to myself without even realizing it. 



Wasn‚Äôt addressing that deep pain that was still inside everytime I was not using drugs. Then I decided it was a good idea to order some china white heroin.. these are literally things I‚Äôd have never have even thought about years ago b4 meeting cameron. 



So i order that and sniff the tiniest bump I can because I ‚Äúknow what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù because I did my ‚Äúresearch‚Äù ‚Äúim not an addict just because I‚Äôm using drugs, I‚Äôm just having a little fun is all‚Äù well I was wrong. 



Short tldr to advance the story: over the next year or so I would order pressed oxys bc that‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than heroin‚Äù even though it had fentanyl and I was aware of that as well. Only blind to the dangers of having some ‚Äúfun‚Äù. 



So now to the main point: I overdosed on oxy last week after having a mental breakdown realizing I actually WAS addicted PLUS had kept the death of my best friend inside for a week and it finally came out. I was already high on oxy at the time and you know what I did to cope with the pain and hysteria I was experiencing?? 



I took a fatter line probably 2 times my normal redose and BOOM: overdose. I wake up about 12 minutes later with paramedics all around me. I was in such a confused state and HAD NO idea what had just happened until after about 10 seconds of me crying and panicking, they told me I overdosed.. I was in literal shock and disbelief. 



‚ÄúHow could this happen to me. I had it under control. I did all my research and was sure if I stuck to the doses I believed I could handle I could do this as long as I want‚Äù After about 2 days after the overdose and being clean I decided it was time to get help.. 



I swear to god I was just like YOU. I read all the stories on here about how you shouldn‚Äôt ever even TOUCH the stuff and I literally laughed at them.. and I would look at the stories about people‚Äôs high experiences and they made me smile... but I still had no idea I was addicted. 



I looked at those people as weak. the ones who have had bad experiences. ‚ÄúGuys just don‚Äôt be stupid with your doses and always test your pills if you‚Äôre worried about it‚Äù (which I never even tested mine; which proved my addiction was started from a mental health issue because I didn‚Äôt care if I got a laced pill. I just wanted to get High. 



Anyway, I have literally 10000 more words to say but not enough time. So If I can give any advice to all of you it would be this.

If you want to really, and I mean REALLY prove you are not addicted: Don‚Äôt use at all for one year and make good life choices. If you can‚Äôt by yourself, then please wake up and catch it before it‚Äôs too late. You are beautiful and you are loved. I love you. üíñ

I‚Äôm so so thankful for the life that I‚Äôm currently living... I couldn‚Äôt have imagined anything like this back when I was at my rock-bottom, and the best part is that it‚Äôs only been 109 days, from which 70 spent in a mental health clinic.

I finally got a job. I quit my job when I was using, because I didn‚Äôt find the motivation to get up and go to work, but now I‚Äôm full of energy and motivation and I‚Äôm so pumped that I get this second chance. I used to work as a supplier, and now I have a job as cashier, which they say is an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù so I‚Äôll take it.

I applied to a dance school because breakdance is a passion of mine, and they accepted me. I was constantly comparing myself to others when it came to breakdance, what I did was never good enough, but it was a form of relief and expression and thats what I do it for... not for anything or anyone else but for myself. I won‚Äôt be doing battles the first year though because I‚Äôm afraid it will just trigger me and disappoint me and I will go back to feeling miserable about myself.

I‚Äôll admit, life in recovery isn‚Äôt always as rose-colored as this, I still have moments that I‚Äôm overwhelmed with sadness and moments that I experience cravings. 

Today I had a moment that I felt miserable, because I have the feeling that I have no friends left, because the only friends I had are the ones that are still using, abusing and partying every damn weekend. I have a whole fellowship but they all live + 1 hour from me, so it isn‚Äôt like we can make spontaneous plans, I‚Äôm definitely not a call person.

I went to an NA meeting today and I shared about my accomplishments, but not about what was bothering me... which I do regret. And I wanted to do that with this post too, only share what went good, while I did feel miserable for a long time today.

142,1,My biggest fear is that I permenantly derailed my intellect I'm Frightened about it after  brewing in cyclonic Patterns and All of these substances.

143,1,"We have a heroin addict in the family, and I don't know how to trust her or build a relationship moving forward. **I'm looking for help in the form of a book, plan, guide, steps, example to give her a plan of changes we need to see to her being trustworthy again.**    

Brief background: My sister-in-law and her husband became heroin addicts sometime between 3-5 years ago. They lost their jobs, house, health, etc. Their 14 yr old daughter is now under our care and we have sole custody. Along the way, they stole over $150,000 (maybe double that) from family members, including most of it from an elderly disabled vet. The amount of time and effort we have spent cleaning up their mess is massive. They still have open criminal cases in other states that they are fleeing from.      

For a year and a half, they have played around with getting clean and being in outpatient methadone treatment. They are now separated but live only 20 minutes away. At this point, he has given up and clearly shown he has no desire to get clean. His mother supports him and gives him money daily. We have almost no contact with him. She has stayed current with the treatment, but I wouldn't call it ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù. She doesn't attend meetings (or does rarely) and is now working as a waitress so she can pay for her $17/day outpatient methadone treatment and gas to get to work.    

Because she is in treatment, and the monthly test there shows she is clean, she has been staying with her mom and using her mom's car and food. While this is contingent on her staying clean, we have caught her using drugs (not suspicion, but unrefutable proof) and still getting a clean test! She says it's only because she was hanging out with her husband and he always drags her back down. Because of that, we have cut off almost all contact for about 6 months. Her mother still lets her stay because the drug tests are clean.    

**Recently**: She *says* she doesn't see her husband anymore and has blocked him on her phone. Swears no drugs. Has tried to give us some money toward her daughter's care (not like a regular budget, but just random amounts at different times). She wants to see her daughter more, and we have allowed a weekly get together for something like a movie or mall shopping.      

Now she says she wants to be a bigger part of her daughter's life. I don't know how to trust her to allow that to happen. I don't know what next steps I expect her to do to rebuild. She acts depressed and unmotivated to do more. I know the research shows that addicts can stay clean and recover better with family support. I don't know how to give that without being lied to, stolen from, endangering her daughter, etc. How can we proceed?    

I'm looking for a good resource with schedule, milestones, ideas, plans --- I want something more than the generic ‚Äúlook for ways to work together‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport the person in their plans to move forward‚Äù. Duh. I'm wanting something like:    

*  Go to NA meetings (3x a week? Daily? Ask for proof?) 
* Save money 
* Get her own car 
* Get her own insurance 
* Show us her paystubs and bank accounts so we know she's not giving the money to husband (For 	drugs) 
* Extra random drug tests (from walgreens?) that she pays for, but we can randomly give.     

Stuff like that, in a timeline or recommendations of other things. I have ideas, but I'm looking for a source that says ‚ÄúWe tried this and it worked‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is reasonable because they are untrustworthy‚Äù or what is the extreme that is too invasive? At what point are we playing parents to a 42-year-old who can't get it together?    

I want to be able to have a tangible list that says she is in RECOVERY, and not just methadone-clean existence."
144,1,"I have the same old story. Started taking painkillers at a young age for endometriosis which led to taking them recreational, and years later, I found myself taking them to feel ""normal"". Getting a legitimate script under medical supervision became impossible when I moved out of state so I used street drugs to mask my depression. A few months ago, I FINALLY was able to afford health insurance. I found out that my hot flashes and depression were due to extremely low levels of estrogen. I quit the street dope, and after initial withdrawal, no more hot flashes!! Thank God!

&amp;#x200B;

Now my problem is that without drugs, I have ZERO energy and sore everywhere. I can't leave my house or even wash my hair. Its been 2 weeks! I can't live like this... I feel like there's an underlying medical issue, but my doc keeps sending me to specialists with months long waiting lists. I have to get drugs just to make it to the appointments. I'm not taking anymore than one bag on the days I need to get to an appointment. Is this normal after stopping opiates? If it is, how does anyone successfully quit? I can't clean the house, let alone work. I feel desperate and confused. I finally have no mental cravings, and just want to stop. But my body won't let me. What could be making me feel this way? I've tried Tramadol and Kratom, but they don't help at all... Besides my hormones, my red blood cells show anemia. Now they're testing me for auto-immune diseases. Has anyone else  had this experience?"

I'm super ADHD but after recently experiencing some serious side effects I've decided its time to stop messing with my brain chem and give learning how to work with the brain I was born with a shot. I started a youtube channel to document the process of cutting down. (The first 4 mins are very ramble-ly just heads up)

He's not going to be open to any kind of sobriety related function, or meetup type group. Will be near Cincinnati Ohio, could travel around 2 hours, just can't spend the night. 


What's some fun adventurous stuff you've found?"
152,1,"Just got discharged into a PHP program from my rehab. It was super nice. Somehow I got shuffled into a fucking crack house in a crack neighborhood. Mandatory 8 hours daily of group, 9-.  chores, a pillow that's worse than nothing, an unbelievably uncomfortable bed? Sharing a bedroom with 5 other people inna 2 bedroom crackhouse apartment that is literally falling apart. The website made this place look amazing. There is absolutely no way I can stay here.

Apparently they don't have a new pillow, and it's burninf up. This place is a fucking dump."
153,1,"Hey everyone. Hope I'm catching you guys, whoever is reading this at a good time. Regardless of what's up with me I'm still praying for the ones suffering. 

I've came along way. 3 years ago I was big time into Adderall daily for two weeks, then heroin or pain pills for 2 weeks. I'd be clean on and off for maybe a week in which I'd sleep. 

Basically in the last 3 years I have indeed dug myself out of a huge hole. I'm still an addict of course but like some addicts I have switched mine to other substances. I take my diazepam as prescribed. ( I know an addict should not take a controlled substance, but my anxiety is just too debilitating ) 

I found myself taking Kratom. It is 100 percent illegal and is claimed to be a dietary supplement not approved by the FDA. Everything the stuff says it's going to do or claims to do it does. Helps with anxiety, helps boost my mood, and helps keep me off of opiates. The problem is that kratom tolerances go up so I find myself taking more and more, plus I know it is illegal in a lot of states and is not looked upon highly by the government or medical professionals. 

My other ""PROBLEM"" which I think is more serious is that about once a month as I see my psychiatrist I get a prescription for an upper called provagil ( modafinil ) to be honest if I could just take 1 a day like the bottle says it would be a wonder drug as I get very tired during the day out of know where &amp; I am not very motivated at all. 
So basically once a month I take 6 provigil tablets and come down from them ( as I'm coming down now ) and tell my family and friends I'll never do it again. I do right now believe I am serious too. All of a sudden in a month though or less I will get that craving and I end up letting this garbage get the best of me. 
Like I said I have came very far but considering I substituted for not as hard drugs, I feel horrible about myself and I still have no idea what to do. I am dual diagnosed. ( If you don't know ) it is when you have a mental disorder, I have debilitating anxiety as well as bad depression and you use substances to mask the problems. 

It's true my worse day sober is better then my best day high. I have tried the AA thing and I was a member but felt like I was completely cheating the program because of the kratom and the diazepam so I stopped going. ( Even though it was amazing !! )

I'm in Illinois and I only have Medicaid. If you we're in my situation what would you do? Therapy, meetings, AA, inpatient, I am willing to do anything to get these demons away for good as I remember being happy sober. I have the option of smoking weed ( it's legal to get off the kratom ) but that's just another substitution. Again I have Medicaid, but I'm clueless as what to do or where to go. Back years ago when I was opiate dependent I have been to one detox 3 times and another one 3 times. My blood pressure got so high it was like I went to the emergency room then home. If anyone can give me any information or ideas, suggestions on how to better my life I'd really appreciate it. 

The kratom I don't think is that bad. 

I do though think this modafinil ( stimulant is horrible ) even just taking 6 pills a month considering I have high blood pressure and I'm not healthy like I was doing Ritalin when I was 26 years old. I just turned 40, I've had enough."
154,1,"As an ex-meth (and lots of other drugs and alcohol) user I can say that I seriously doubt that throwing money at addicts is going to be enough motivation for anyone to make any real changes toward getting better. But it is nice that people are trying to think of ways to help addicts. I just don't think incentive based programs will be very effective. The money would probably be better used as a 'scholarship fund' for those who agree to go to to longer term inpatient treatment facilities that wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. 

I have been clean and sober from alcohol and all narcotic substances for nearly 8 years. The first 2 years I spent in halfway house type circumstances. Those who stayed in recovery houses/sober living facilities longer had much better chances of achieving lasting recovery, and more than a few of the people there with me are still clean and sober. I can't say the same for those locals who we saw out in 12 step meetings who couldn't afford admission into longterm treatment facilities. I worked to be able to afford to stay at those places, but I wouldn't have been able to ""get in the door"" without the generosity and willingness of my family to help pay for my entry. 

Some people don't have that luxury, and most of them that I met are still doing drugs. Some are hating every minute of it and ready for help anytime, and some want out after something particularly bad happens, but none of these people who couldn't afford it when they would be otherwise ready to try and change have been given the decency of a fighting chance. That time I spent re-learning how to live my live clean and free with the help of a community of others in recovery was an invaluable resource, and I'm not sure I would still be sober without having experienced that for myself. A program to get them into long term facilities could be the beginning of lasting recovery for many of them. 

I am grateful every day for the help I was given. I think giving money to addicts who are ready for that kind of commitment get into longer term sober living facilities, the kind that monitor where you go and drug screen you randomly several times a week, would be a much better use of this money than handing it directly to addicts in need. This is just my opinion though, I'd love to hear what others may think!

155,1,Im an addict with heroin as a drug of choice. I've been making honest attempts at getting clean but something always comes up it seems and I start grasping for straws to smoke dope. I recently took a vacation to San Francisco with my girlfriend and her kids. In hindsight not a very great place to be as a recovering addict. I got into a fight with my girlfriend and decided to walk over to Market and 7th. (Drug capital of san fran) I scored some fentanyl and smoked it in the bathroom of a Boys and Girls Club park bathroom. I died for 30 mins. Was brought back to life. Im still in shock about everything. Checking into a treatment facility when my pneumonia clears from inhaling my own vomit. Fuck my life.

‚ÄúEven in self-protection, we do not wish to erect the slightest barrier between ourselves and the fellow alcoholic who still suffers. We know that society has been demanding that he conform to its laws and conventions. But the essence of his alcoholic malady is the fact that he has been unable or unwilling to conform either to the laws of man or God. If he is anything, the sick alcoholic is a rebellious nonconformist. How well we understand that.‚Äù

157,1,"This Saturday, I will be exactly 1 month substance free. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it. I had an argument with my boyfriend, who seriously lacks emotional intelligence, and his pessimistic approach to life is seriously hurting me. He doesn't understand, and often unintentionally hurts me due to his ignorance.
I'm also dealing with drug-induced psychosis. Stressful situations like this one often worsen it.

159,1,Just bored and don't know what to do. Want to head to that house and see what's going on. Not worth it in the long run. My usual distractions aren't working and don't know what to do.
160,1,"Hey yall. I've been mostly clean for almost a year. By mostly clean I mean that I still smoke Marijuana sometimes but not nearly as much as I used to, maybe once or twice a month. But I'm thinking about giving it up completely. We'll see. I had about 8 months last year where I used no substances at all. I've had a few relapses (probably 3?) via alcohol but I've still changed my substance use patterns a lot. 

Anyways, after years of smoking Marijuana every day starting when I was a 15, lots of Xanax abuse (including an overdose in attempt to commit suicide), a fair amount of opiate abuse, and just picking up whatever pills to get high wherever I could, I've seriously changed my habits. I'm feeling a lot better than I was when I was in active addiction. It's like a whole new lease on life. So yay for that!

However, I can definetly tell that some my cognitive functioning has been impacted by my past drug abuse. I've always had speech and language issues (namely stuttering) but I feel like my audio processing is absolute shit now. When people talk to me I often have to ask them to repeat themselves several times and it's very frustrating for me as well as the other person. Furthermore, I often just can't think of words or forget what I'm doing in the middle of doing it. 

In addition, I have a terrible short term memory. For example, about a month ago I moved into an apartment as part of a housing program. I met my roommate and she told me her name but I immediately forgot it. It was really embarrassing and frustrating. I'm assuming most of this is from Xanax abuse and using a lot of Marijuana while I was still pretty young.

The other consequence is that I now cannot take opiate pain medications. I'm okay with that, however as a transgender woman I would like to someday undergo srs (""the surgery"") but with the excruciating pain people feel after having such a major surgery done, pain management via opioids is a must. I'm currently trying to undergo breast augmentation, which is less painful and can sometimes be followed up with extra strength Tylenol, however it still may be hard to find a surgeon willing to do it without sending me home with a pain med prescription. 

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here, I guess I just wanted to vent my frustrations. If you can relate or have any validation or advice to offer I'm open to it. Thanks for reading."
162,1,"I only went to rehab for two months and honestly I wasn't there long enough to even get the help I feel like I truly needed. I was supposed to go to a new rehab that's why I was put on a hiatus from my first one. I am back in my home town waiting to get a bed date and it took so long for a bed date I had already relapsed days before. But weeks after waiting for my bed date my mom gets inpatient and canceles my bed date and asks me to do outpatient.

Okay so question, if I am currently using every other day and jonesing for the meth like I did before. Is there even any point in me going to outpatient? Like I truly do not think I even want to spend a day sober and actually going to that.

I have been jonesing for the meth pretty badly. I  constantly fighting a losing battle all over again with meth and i didn't even imagine early on that I would actually relapse. 

What the hell do I do? I wish my mom wouldn't have given away my bed date. I just don't think I even know how to handle all of this head on I honestly.

i think i might have romantic feelings for someone, but i don‚Äôt want to admit that just yet. every time i‚Äôve admitted to having romantic feelings for someone it ended up in either me getting hurt or hurting someone; i just don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. i think that clarity and honesty are VERY important when it comes to romantic relationships, and this person has helped me make the mental connections that not everyone in this world wants to hurt you. 

i‚Äôve previously never let anyone see me vunerable because that‚Äôs when i get hurt, but this person has seen me in some of the worst states of mind that i‚Äôve been in, and continues to talk to me and treats me how i want to be treated, and i think that it is lovely. 

i just really don‚Äôt want to rush into anything. zooming into things only leads to careless mistakes and injuries. i just don‚Äôt want to see any other people hurt if i can prevent it;  sometimes seeing people get hurt is inevitable, though. the history of the situation is the most important part because if too much has already happened, sometimes it is just better to let someone hit rock bottom and  be there for when they need to pick themselves up off the ground and rebuild a life, and that is what i‚Äôm doing right now. rebuilding my life."

This last year I‚Äôve really come around. Quit doing H, then I quit smoking Cigs. I‚Äôve smoked weed since I was 14 so I really didn‚Äôt have the intention of quitting that.but these last two months I‚Äôve come to realize I‚Äôm still numbing myself from my choices. One these choices is staying in contact with a ex from almost a decade ago. She‚Äôs a great person. But sometimes I feel like i had to give myself a reason for her to leave me for someone else. So I started useing pills cause I knew she didn‚Äôt like that. I just couldn‚Äôt come to terms that she didn‚Äôt feel like I felt about her. Well that mindset has changed. After I realized this I couldn‚Äôt stand being in her presence.. She‚Äôs married now, but uses me as a replacement companion while her husband completes his masters or something. It was a real shoddy deal. But what I would do is get high and and almost pretend in my mind that things were different, even though in reality. We‚Äôll ALWAYS be just friends. I‚Äôve always desired to move on from her, and I‚Äôve had a few gfs. But I always end up her close friend as she needs me. I literally couldn‚Äôt deal anymore but she wasn‚Äôt getting it.

I am 21, in college, I have a good job, I love my roommates, I live a healthy lifestyle, and I work a solid program. Sometimes I‚Äôll feel so good I will call/text my parents, or my sisters, and just talk about life. For example, today I had a good conversation with my older sister about our old lives together at home, how I hurt her, and how I want to make up for it. It was a very feel good conversation. However, I always wonder if my family questions, during these chats, whether or not I have relapsed and that‚Äôs why I am so happy. For years, I was constantly monotone and miserable. I have experienced a drastic change in my life and personality thanks to the program given to me, yet I cannot help but wonder if my family has healed in the same way I am beginning to.

171,1,"I know some of you here may relate to this, so I thought I would vent here.

Just as some background, I'm going through a tough protracted withdrawal that has been so exacerbated due to years of kindling and substance abuse from alcohol/benzos and a plethora of other drugs. I'm almost 6 months sober, and in active recovery (12 steps, great therapist, sponsor, etc.). I did this for myself because I love myself, and wanted to finally be the person I know I am deep down -- my inner child. I'm so thankful for a new opportunity at life, and I feel spiritually at peace.

Physically, I'm in hell. My family simply cannot understand my agony. I'm basically going through a benzo PAWS setback, or at least that's what it feels like. For any of you out there that have been through SSRI/benzo withdrawal hell, you might be able to relate to my symptoms: intrusive thoughts, fear, black depression, physical and mental anxiety of the highest order, the list goes on...... 

My family has been nonexistent in this hardship. They simply cannot understand what I'm going through, nor do they care to learn. All they want to do is convert me to their religion, or berate my for my wrongdoings, or tell me how I've failed them. I've opened up to them about my substance about, and both have rejected me instead of opening their arms. My parents were, after all, the spark that ignited my rocket into this dark abyss of substance abuse. They have never listened to me, to who I am, and what I need. I am recovering without the love and support of my family. I never had their love to begin with, only their selfish desire to mold me to be exactly what they wanted.

The good news is that I have found so many friends and peers that are lifting me up in this trial. I am so assured of my recovery due to the people in my life that do love me and can hold my hand when it gets rough. I'm so thankful for my new family. Recovery for me has been learning about those who truly love and accept you, without judgment. Recovery is learning to be free of the shackles of false higher powers.

I hope you all know that you matter, and you are deserving of the love you need. I sure am, and so are you. I hope you all find your true family in this world."

176,1,"104 days clean off everything, but heroin was my worst vice.  I sleep, eat, and work like everyone else. Still regularly hitting meetings every day but Sunday.  Still have some personal problems but I can at least do something about them. I'm at step 6.

This post is a thanks and one fucking huge encouragement to all who still suffer and struggle. In November I was stuck in a nasty months long cycle of relapse, withdrawal, and more shit. Probation cut me slack and I only go once a month now. In lieu of rehab, I must attend meetings 3x a week. I hit 7. Two on friday.

I never thought I'd be able to do this. I can't believe I got clean and haven't used this long. Don't intend to start again.  If I can do it, we all can. I was so hopeless and now the future looks bright."

178,1,"Hi everyone, 

I've battled with my coke and alcohol addiction for the last 10 years and I've hit rock bottom more times than I can count. I've quit and relapsed more times than i can count too and it's honestly demoralizing and draining. If I dont stop now I know my body will stop for me and I'm ready to get my life back. I'm going to start attending smart recovery meetings and ive finally come clean to my family because ivw realised after multiple attempts and playing down my addiction it has spiralled out of control, I'm afraid of myself because despite wanting to stop I cant seem too. So I'm taking steps to take my life back ans I decided to write a goodbye letter to my addiction, I just wrote how I feel and I hope it can help anyone struggling with the same issues because I'm so tired of this merry go round so its time for me to say goodbye.

Dear addiction,

It's been a long time coming, but it's time for me to say goodbye. We had some fun times, you made me believe without you I couldn't truly be me, I couldn't express myself or be creative, confident or fun. You made me feel like my best self. Once the party was over and my money ran out, you always left me, with way less than what I started with. You bled me dry then left when I had nothing to give. So I tried to cut you off, so many times! only to come back running like a fool, because facing life without you felt too lonely, boring and empty. I realise now that was all a lie, the truth is your an illusion, you got me into situations that could have risked my life, waking up in foreign beds wondering how I got there?? Wasting all my money and leaving me depressed unless I had you around. I risked everything for you! Even my life.. and where has it got me? I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, your a temporary happiness credit card, but the interest is too high and the payoff isn't worth the investment. You lied, you didnt make me happy, you just enhanced all the good things In me that I believed I couldn't achieve without you. You made me lie and manipulate my family just so I could be with you, I even stopped going out with friends just so u could be with you. Then when you used me up you left me high and dry.


When the fun is over you leave me broke empty depressed, suicidal and alone. I promise myself I won't see you again but I've forgotten how to function without you. I've said we're over 100 times but this time is different, I want my life back, I want to have a good conscience, money in my pocket, good health, make memories with loved ones. I know with you around it can only end in 2 ways, dead or in jail I almost lost everything that mattered to me and I had to wake up and take off the rose coloured glasses. I know it wont be easy, and you'll lie to me and tell me you miss me, we can have fun Just one more time. But the reality is, this just isnt fun anymore! 

I'm tired of laying awake at night unable to sleep because you've messed with my head, leaving me high and dry once again.. I'm tired of having panic attacks wondering if I'm having a heart attack, I'm tired of waking up hungover, sick pounding head desperate to sleep but unable too, checking my bank to realise I gave you all my money. It's time for me to say goodbye before my family have to say goodbye to me because of you. It's been a long road but I'm ready to live my life without you because I am worth more than the dreams, lies and empty promises youve sold me."
181,1,"It‚Äôs so hard to quit, but it did so much damage in my life. Now I miss it, but my life is much better. The life I have is amazing. I have so many opportunities, so much potential. It‚Äôs endless. And only possible if I stay clean. 

It‚Äôs just hard because I so often want to go back. Like today, I missed it. And it seems so harmless at first, especially compared to other substances. 

I have a year! Yay!"
182,1,"Long story short: I met her in early recovery and was there for her through tough times, and on her 1 year, was very supportive, got her a gift, etc. I just had my one year, and not a peep from her. 

So fuck her. I just removed her from all my social media and when it comes to friends, I have plenty of other people who care. It just sucks that I was there for her and she can‚Äôt reciprocate."
183,1,"After my sister died of a heroin overdose in July, I went back down the rabbit hole of addiction. I threw away 18 months of sobriety. Since August 1st, I‚Äôve only been able to put together a few days of sobriety at a time. The past few weeks I‚Äôve been getting worse. The walls started closing in. Last night, in my drunken stupor, yelling at god, I decided it was time to turn my mental pain into physical pain. I pushed myself to the limit. I ripped open a new pack of cigarettes with my teeth because I was too fucked to open it with my hands. A few cigarettes broke from the unconventional technique I used to open the pack, but it was mostly a full pack. One by one, I smoked each cigarette and put them out on my forearm. I pushed the cherry as deep into my skin as I could until the flame was smothered. I needed more so I started putting them out on my chest. The skin bubbled and melted. The burn wounds went down to the muscle. It didn‚Äôt take long for it to start to feel good. I did this with the whole pack. Today, after putting a shirt on, the burn wound started to stick to the fabric of my shirt. Every time i move my shirt or take it off, the wounds open and tear away from the fabric. All day, I‚Äôve been popping pus bubbles so the wounds don‚Äôt get infected. So much more happened last night but the cigarette burns were the worst. The scars will never go away. I can only hope my scars can heal someone else."
184,1,"That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been living my life for the last two years up until recently. Before then, I was a six-year college student hooked on opiates. For lent, I‚Äôm giving up booze. But even through all of the detoxes, rehabs, IOPs, PHPs, therapy sessions (I think you get the point), I‚Äôve never really been able to tell my story. About how the most likable kid on Earth, with a life desired by many, begged for it all to be sabotaged time and time again.

I first picked up pills in high school. If you‚Äôve ever been to an AA meeting, you‚Äôve heard war stories, so I‚Äôll spare you that, I‚Äôll just tell you that on May 8th, 2018, my opiate use ended when I overdosed behind the wheel and got into an accident. Could‚Äôve killed myself; could‚Äôve killed the poor people who I hit. I got off with a simple DUI.

I‚Äôd like to say that moment was a wake up call. It wasn‚Äôt. I got Vivitrol injections on and off until I stopped getting them altogether. I picked up again, and on February 21st, 2019, I OD‚Äôd again, alone, in my bedroom. Somehow, in the middle of the night, my mother found me. She saved my life. I was able to talk them out of rehab, because, well, I wasn‚Äôt an addict, right? It was a one-off deal. Back to therapy I went.

Five weeks later, on March 27th, 2019, I OD‚Äôd alone in my room again, ironically with a textbook open beside me and my laptop on. If it weren‚Äôt for my dog begging at my dad‚Äôs bedside to wake him up, then he wouldn‚Äôt never known to break down my door and save my life. This time, it was clear that this was no ‚Äúone-off‚Äù deal. I was Section 35‚Äôd‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshipped off in cuffs and shackles to the shittiest rehab center around. I was ordered by court to remain there for 21 days.

I somehow was able to keep my job at the bank, but soon after getting out, I left for a new bank. A better job. I wanted a fresh start. The next thing you know, I‚Äôm absolutely loving my new job. I‚Äôm completely clean off of drugs. And then I discovered vodka.

Every single night after work, I‚Äôd hit up the bar next door and slug a million vodka sodas. They‚Äôd never cut me off‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was a regular. Their owner and all of their workers were customers of mine at the bank. If they did by chance cut me off, I‚Äôd head to the bar next door. But as my professional life came together, and it looked like I had everything under control, I started to self sabotage.

I‚Äôd drink and I‚Äôd become verbally abuse to women. I met the woman who I thought was the love of my life. She thought she met the perfect kid‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa charming, good-enough looking college grad from the ‚ÄòBurbs with a banking go. I squandered our relationship because I was a drunken mess who became verbally abusive to her when I drank. This started to become a pattern with every girl. They‚Äôd try to amicably break things off with me when they discovered I was an alcoholic. I‚Äôd berate, belittle, and harass them out of insecurity. And every time, I‚Äôd wake up the next day feeling like a coward.

‚ÄúPeople are like oceans. You cannot know them by their surface.‚Äù

Friends and family call me Eddie Haskell. I‚Äôm a natural schmoozer, and a great salesman‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm great with people. My idol is the wolf of Wall Street, for Christ‚Äôs sake. I‚Äôm always cheerful, upbeat, energetic, and happy. I‚Äôm smart as fuck. I‚Äôm great at my job. Everybody loves me. But the stress and trouble that comes with addiction will take all of that away from you.

Today, I was feeling depressed. I needed a place to share my story, so I took to medium. I wanted people to know that the grass is greener on the other side‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it‚Äôs a tall fence separating the two. But there‚Äôs hope. There‚Äôs always hope. Take it from a kid who‚Äôs been through every time of addiction you can think of. It‚Äôs important to always believe in yourself. Some days, I feel proud as fuck. Yesterday marked 11 month since I was OD‚Äôd in the very bed I lay in as I type this. I just got home from a job that I love with a company that loves me. And it‚Äôs because through the overdoses, the rehab stints, the legal troubles, the ruined relationships, and lost friends, I always fucking believed in myself.

So when you think it‚Äôs time to throw in the towel, don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt ever give up on becoming the person you know who can be. And on the long road to becoming that person‚Äîfuck, have some fucking pride.

‚ÄúDuring adversity is not the time to like your wounds. Failure makes you who you are.‚Äù

185,1,"Hey folks,

I browsed a few subreddits and figured this might be the best place to post but please redirect if it isn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic, got sober for the first time in 2018, spent basically all of 2019 drinking and regretting and hit reset just after New Years. Back in those rose-coloured glasses moments where I don‚Äôt doubt yet that it was the right choice and that I‚Äôm better off this way because I hate myself and how I behave and treat others when I‚Äôm drinking. 
Anyway, this isn‚Äôt about me but my SO. 
He has smoked weed pretty much every day for the past 5 years or so. 
He quit a couple weeks ago, more out of necessity but also because we had a late-night conversation where I managed to somehow make him see the bright side of quitting and being sober. So initially he was curious and actually willing to give it a go. But today he said he hasn‚Äôt had any positives yet. He‚Äôs more irritable, more aggressive and realised he really doesn‚Äôt do it for himself (but for me). 
I never asked him to quit for me and I wouldn‚Äôt. I even said I don‚Äôt mind if he smokes, I just think it‚Äôd definitely be better for him in the long-run if he really cuts back on his use. he‚Äôs of the opinion he‚Äôs not an addict. He was originally planning on smoking for his birthday and 420 and if he then notices that the cravings get worse or his use would escalate he will stay off it for another while longer.  
But with his recent statement regarding his feelings about the whole ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô I‚Äôm pessimistic he‚Äôs going to keep that attitude up.

I just want to support him without being pushy and forcing my views on him but I don‚Äôt know how. I honestly believe that it will get better for him. I told him before he quit that he will have to work on character traits he doesn‚Äôt like if he doesn‚Äôt want to be that way but not go back to smoking, and that it won‚Äôt be easy. 

Is it selfish of me to want him to be sober? 
I‚Äôm at a loss on how to approach the subject and bring it up with him because I don‚Äôt want to cause conflict or upset him. All I want is to support and help him.

Thank you for making it this far. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or outsider‚Äôs opinion on the subject.

TLDR: stoner bf recently quit for me and not for himself. He‚Äôs only experiencing negative effects so far and I don‚Äôt know how to help him to keep going"

187,1,"Feeling shitty and depressed, over the last 8 months my cocaine addiction has spiralled out of control, especially since I started using by myself and I promise myself every comedown I'm done!.. until I feel ok again then im desperately craving it all over again.

I wasted my money again yesterday, spent the whole night getting high even though I had to wake up early this morning. I also couldnt sleep because the chest pressure and random heart pain gave me anxiety which is happening more frequently, yet despite worrying I could be having a heart attack I still push on and get high?!

I genuinely dont want to do it anymore but I have zero self control or will power.

Any tips on how to not relapse would much appreciated because I cant keep living this way. I joined cocaine anon a few weeks ago which led to me exchanging numbers with a girl who was supposed to be supporting me and end up dropping out and we ended up using together which defeated the whole point of me going!

I‚Äôm scared I finally found something to help me get myself out of this hole but now I feel like I‚Äôm on a time limit and I‚Äôm freaked out.

191,1,"I‚Äôm 3 years sober, after a number of 1-2 year sober runs, and try to avoid spending much time around bars, parties, etc.  of course this makes me a bit of a pariah.  Most of my close friends dropped me after I quit drinking the first go around.  Stopped inviting me on trips etc.  

One problem I have is I lead a work team of about 400 people (in NYC) and obviously have to hold events, take my leadership team out, go to business events, etc.  I‚Äôve pretty much got it down to an art.  

I try to host the parties at bars that have activities whenever possible.  Bowling, Dave and Busters, places like that.  I go early and open the tab for the first 90 minutes.  I order my self soda and bitters as soon as I get there.  Order one or two of those.  Close the tab, cause who wants to party with the boss anyway? And, leave as everyone really gets going.  

But, recently I had two really obnoxious situations.  First was a manager on my team bought everyone shots right when I was leaving.  He got really pushy when I said ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù.  I had just finished giving a quick wrap-up thank you for all they do.  He kept pushing the shot in my face in front of everyone until I told him I simply don‚Äôt drink.  Everyone sorta looked taken aback.  Then he shouts, ‚Äúand I thought I liked you.‚Äù  I replied, ‚ÄúI thought I liked you too.‚Äù  Then said my goodbyes and left.  Probably not my best response. 

So two nights ago I had to go out with a business team we are partnering with.  About halfway through dinner one of the other teams‚Äôs executives asked me if I never drink. I laughed and said, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt work for me. I have no off switch.  Best to stick with the soda.‚Äù  

Then someone else in the group started on a tirade about all the reasons you can‚Äôt trust people who don‚Äôt drink.  Others started to agree and drunkenly make a big deal about it.  His problem I know. 

Anyway, I ordered a cup of coffee, made some small talk and left to FaceTime my kids.  

It just keeps grinding at me.  These guys have no idea how fucking hard I‚Äôve worked to be sober.  How much I want to drink, don‚Äôt want to drink, and won‚Äôt.    One even said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre an alcoholic.‚Äù  Uhh... it‚Äôs exactly like that.

I guess it also bothers me that I held my job together, with ever increasing promotions.  So, I think my former friends, coworkers and colleagues just think I‚Äôm an asshole who won‚Äôt drink.  

Anyway, sorry to ramble.  Just want to know what all of you do to maintain a social/work life when drinking seems to be the only way people socialize these days.

TLDR; have to attend drinking events and people constantly push drinks and act like I‚Äôm some kind of untrustworthy asshole for not drinking.  How do you all manage that?"

194,1,"Hey guys...I guess I really just need support right now and really need to let this out and am not really feeling like going to an NA meeting because its not a system that works for me. but if anybody has words of advice that would be great too.  

Trigger warning for benzo addicts!!! Benzos will be discussed. 

So basically I‚Äôve been clean off of all my drugs of choice for 3 years. Benzos did some serious damage to my central nervous system and my brain chemistry but I was finally starting to feel back being grounded and healthy again when I started getting these early morning shifts for work. I‚Äôm a fairly severe insomniac so getting up at 6 was very difficult for me when unable to sleep especially considering I have a job that requires focus and mental stability. So I decided to order some etizolam which is an rc analogue of benzos. ‚Äújust for emergencies, when I really can‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù Of course as soon as it gets to my house I couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation and ingested a small dose. The next afternoon I take another small dose planning to stop after that for awhile until I actually need it. Then the next day i experiences rebound anxiety and withdrawals. (Maybe because I‚Äôve abused them in that past? Not really sure why I got withdrawals so easily.) now I‚Äôve been on a 4 day bender to avoid withdrawals and cravings and I feel like I just ruined all my hard work of staying clean for 3 years and healing my mind and body. Now that I re opened that door, it‚Äôs gonna be harder to stop than it was to stay clean after a few years of resetting my chemistry. I feel like I‚Äôm in a totally pickle. I took it because of my anxiety and now I‚Äôm gonna have worst rebound anxiety and insomnia and I just don‚Äôt want to stop. My heart is telling me to stop, all the negative side effects of being an addict are returning. Hiding it from friends and family, distancing myself and secluding myself, memory and cognitive dysfunction etc... I know the longer I continue this bender the worst it‚Äôs gonna be but I also just feel like it‚Äôs such a bad time to go through this with how many hours I‚Äôm working...I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be super bad if I stop now but at the same time I felt pretty fucking shitty when I tried to stop after doing it twice my heart rate was super high and my mind was scattering all over the place. I also feel like I lost some of my hope considering after 3 years I still had dreams about using and still had many many temptations and it‚Äôs hard for me to accept that I simply can‚Äôt do drugs that take away my anxiety anymore ever again to really stay sober, which means I‚Äôm either gonna have to figure out a way to mellow myself out naturally or live with a lot of anxiety more than the average person. (Was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was 15, I‚Äôm 23 now.) anyways that‚Äôs my rant...I feel pretty depressed about the whole thing and just really need support because I really don‚Äôt wanna break my freinds and families hearts and scare/worry them by talking to them about it and also haven‚Äôt really found a recovery system that works for me, most meetings trigger me because all they talk about is drugs and addictions reminding me that I‚Äôm an an addict which also reminds me that drugs exist that make me feel good and that subconsciously I really want to do them. Music and meditation has really been my recovery system and it worked really well for me I just kinda fucked up..."

(19, F)

I've been thinking about telling my parents, or at least my mom, about my mental health issues. I haven't been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure I've been dealing with anxiety since I was a teenager, alongside with depressive episodes and an on-and-off eating disorder. I've always been very private about these issues with my parents because they have always been busy with work/ exhausted from it. I didn't want to become another thing they had to worry about.

Last year was the lowest point of my depression and self-harmed through my anorexia/BPD. I never told anyone about it apart from saying I was feeling down. I'm not in a bad place anymore aside from bad days. I basically recovered by myself (honestly by power of will, eating healthy, working out, self-care, and deciding I never wanted to feel that way again and nobody would come and save me).

Lately I've decided to open up more, and I've been dropping hints about my depression. I think my mother will ask about it soon. I just don't know how to go about telling her.  I honestly don't even know if I should tell her. I'm afraid that it will hurt her instead of helping me. The only reason I'm even considering telling them about it is because a close friend pointed out my parents deserve to know the truth and I deserve to have their support. But I don't know if it's worth it. We don't have enough money for therapy, so I'm left wondering what good it will make. On the other hand, I've said enough that she's suspicious of my mental health, so it's not like I can act like nothing happened.

The only other time I've ever even wanted to tell her was during my teenage years, completely out of spite and as a way to express that I only ever wanted attention and her to realize I was starving myself. I wanted my mom to know how much I was suffering. But I don't feel that way anymore. In some ways I still blame her for my eating disorder: even though she did make mistakes (contributing to my poor self image, teaching me disordered eating habits, not realizing I was starving myself before her eyes) I also know she is a good woman and would never hurt me on purpose. She is not malicious. I don't want her to feel it's her fault, but I don't even know where to begin to explain everything. Any tips will be appreciated.

Sorry I kind of rambled, but I'm sincerely scared shitless. My mom does not need another source of stress in her life. 

Any tips will be appreciated."

My father was physically abusive and emotionally unavailable. Ultimately I internalized all of this and as a result I've never had a ""good"" self esteem. A few years ago I figured out that I could fake it.

and I looked healthier and people treated me like I was healthy but on the inside I was still broken.

I've hated myself for so long and I've made so much progress.

But still. I can believe that I am a good person. But I made so many mistakes and I hurt so many people.

I've been trying to forgive myself but. It hurts and I don't know how to ease my worries. I did the work on myself to get better and I continue to reform myself.

I don't ever want to go back to who I was. Nothing really makes sense and I'm not sure what to do with myself anymore. I go to therapy and I take medication.

but deep down I feel like I need to cry. But I can't because it was just ingrained in me so deeply that men don't cry. When I do it is because it is so excruciatingly painful, crying becomes a necessity.

I hurt my wife, very deeply. I was delusional and chemically imbalanced our entire relationship and it ended and I got on medication after. I want to try again. I'm not perfect, but I'm not the person I once was. I learned from my mistakes. I don't know what to do.

I'm healthy in the way that my brain is functioning much better and I can handle myself and control myself much better. but the deeper hurts, those can't be healed as easily. I'm afraid, It might take decades to heal those wounds.

Am I wrong for wanting to try again with my wife? We haven't split yet, but only time will tell."
206,1,"My dad died a few weeks ago, and I've been bed ridden since, unable to get up, shower, eat or anything. Today was the first time I've been able to get out of bed, have a shower and make my bed. I even ate a full meal. I'm so proud of myself, and I'm sure my dad is too. I've always battled depression, yet I'm evidence that if you hang on for long enough, it starts getting better, even if it's small stuff like getting out of bed or having a shower."

209,1,"i never thought about the future before because i didn‚Äôt think i would have one. i thought i‚Äôd be dead by 16, for sure by 18. i never thought i would reach adulthood or live to see a day in college. i wanted to leave, cease existing, and so i never made a single realistic plan, never thought about what i wanted out of life. i didnt want a life.

&amp;#x200B;

but now, i'm sitting in my bed, in my carefully decorated dorm room, at age 18, deciding my major, and i wish i could see into my future. all of a sudden i have so many possibilities, so many different paths open for me to take--so many that i can‚Äôt decide. i wish i could go down each and see what happens, see which one brings me the most happiness. i know the choices i make now aren‚Äôt permanent, but they still feel monumentous because they‚Äôre the first steps I‚Äôve ever taken towards my future.

&amp;#x200B;

there are still bad days, but i don't want to die anymore and i'm much, much happier overall. and man, am i proud of myself for getting to a place where i have a future. where my biggest struggle is deciding on the best version of that future :)"

211,1,I need help referring my wife to a treatment center for detox that focuses on dual diagnosis for addiction as well as mental health. Anywhere in the country is fine. I'm in california myself in SCRCs program and I'm doing great. She has finally hit her bottom and wants to deal with the pain and suffering she has put herself through. I selfishly would like her in San Diego with me while she goes through her recovery. I will only be willing to go the route that is the best for her though - I know what's best in the sense of temperature and climate and she needs warm and sunshine.

213,1,"I was hit by a car on 10/27/18. I suffered a broken tibia,fibula and femur. It‚Äôs been about 4 months since the accident and I want/need at this point some advice regarding what I‚Äôm to expect during this recovery. Any and all stories and tips would be great. I‚Äôm walking and weight bearing but in a lot of pain.

215,1,"I have my own apartment. I work full-time as an Uber and Lyft driver in central California where it‚Äôs plenty busy. in 45 to 50 hours I can make 1200 a week. I‚Äôm saving my money. I should be able to pay for school out of my own pocket, and graduate from my masters program without taking on the ridiculous student loans that the other students will take.  I‚Äôm getting my friends back.

Ive thought about my friends every day for the past 5 to 6 years, but I knew I wasn‚Äôt healthy enough to try to contact them or rebuild those relationships.  so i had to wait.  

i‚Äôm almost healthy enough now. They had a reunion recently and I didn‚Äôt go but I had my sister-in-law say hi for me (she has been a huge blessing), and she told me that everybody missed me.  next time I will go.

I love them all so much. I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to love friends this much. 

i‚Äôm working a 12 step program in sex and love addicts anonymous.  as a teenager I would compulsively hit on women (I was just lonely and love deprived, and didnt know how to
reach out for real love), and I was enslaved to sexual compulsions that destroyed my emotional depth.   I also used alcohol to numb the pain. Today I am free of both addictions, thank God.  i‚Äôm happy being single and don‚Äôt mind just being friends with women with zero expectations. When I‚Äôm at home I enjoy reading, sleeping, playing music, playing video games and writing.

Life has never been better. My relationship with my family has never been better. It is possible to feel very good. As addicts we had an immense capacity for feeling awful, but that can be turned around and we can feel better than anybody if we work a good program of recovery.

please stick with it, and try everything. There will be days that suck, but it is worth it.  Im a slow learner with some things.  I entered recovery in 2011, and my work is paying off.  It takes time.  as addicts, we spent years, even decades, destroying our lives and alienating people.  It will take more than one meeting and even 1 year in recovery to heal.  

supplement your 12 step recovery with other spiritual resources as well.  there are so many ways we can take ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù for our spiritual sickness.  I also go to church, and would go to counseling if I had the money for it.

not all the days are great, but the funks dont usually last long."

222,1,"Hello Everyone,

Great resource here! I'd like to introduce myself and hopefully someone can provide some insight on my feelings and struggle with opiate sobriety.

So I've struggled with opiate since graduating college in 2009, over a decade! Been to treatment 6 times, with very little success but I also didn't really want it I wanted to get out of trouble.

Anyway, I've recently reached out to some old, good friends that I burned in order to get high in 2010 through 2012. Now since they obviously my life has kept going, but it is the same day everyday. Deal with crippling anxiety, lay in bed all day blowing off obligations, blowing through jobs, its just the same thing every day. Trying to come up with $30 or whatever to get some poxy..

So I've been really trying Suboxone treatment and also CBD with varying success. I recently had this somewhat revelation that in my mind it is almost like I can apologize to these people and no we won't be friends, but that relationship will continue or something in my head. I feel like everything around me has been on pause since opiates became a real issue. I'm having a lot of trouble coming to terms with that and moving on rather than being so down on myself for wasting so much time. I'm in a good relationship now, but it is about to fall apart solely because of continued selfish actions...

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno has anyone else ever felt like during their active addiction that they could sort of go back to the way things were before? Feeling reminiscent and also upset/jealous with myself for loosing these people and relationships.

It keeps me from getting better, I think that is what is keeping me here.

225,1,"Hey everyone 

I‚Äôve been on reddit with/without an account for a while now but have never posted. But I felt tonight was a good night to actually post something. 

I am a musician and have wrote some of my best/successful songs while on cocaine. I have been off/on it since I was 17 (I‚Äôm almost 24 now) 

I‚Äôve been to meetings like AA, HA, NA etc. But have noticed an intense lack of CA focused meetings in my area. This has ultimately led to me feeling like I didn‚Äôt have a real problem or  like didn‚Äôt have a legit meeting I could relate with. I would go to HA or NA and feel awkward that I hadn‚Äôt done those drugs and only had a problem with cocaine and felt almost embarrassed and almost like my addiction was ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù or like I didn‚Äôt understand. 

I guess I‚Äôm posting on here to hopefully have some people who understand where I am coming from and also struggle with cocaine addiction. Or people who are musicians who have abused the drug or have used it as an inspiration/tool for their art. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt find a meeting, or like it is easy to give up. I feel stupid that I can‚Äôt get off it. I‚Äôve been off and on for 5+ years and can‚Äôt fucking shake the damn drug."

234,1,So i had almost 2 years and i went back out. Now i have a whole 30 days and it doesn‚Äôt even feel worth it anymore.

I thought i wanted to work in treatment and be an addiction counselor but I‚Äôm starting to question that. I‚Äôm a house manger and I work 12 hour overnights and its really starting to get to me. I‚Äôve started hating AA meetings and recovery in general i just want to get fucked up and sleep for like 2 days. I feel like i shouldn‚Äôt be a mentor for recovery if I don‚Äôt even want it myself. I don‚Äôt know anymore.

‚ÄúThe sensation of fitting in for someone who has always felt like an outsider is an exquisitely rare feeling.‚Äù

239,1,"(From last night)


This is the closest I‚Äôve come in over a year. I think about it all the time. Sometimes as often as a couple times a week. Sometimes, a month or two can pass before I think about it. But I think about the pinch in my skin. I think about the relief I feel. I think about how it settles my world and how it justifies something. I don‚Äôt even know what that something is, but it quiets the screaming chaos I hear. I think about how awful it is, how horrible I feel after, and how badly I want to do it again. 

The last time I cut was March 2017. I made it almost 3 years and I think about it all the time. Today I tried my best to find a blade. Using the comb and razor in my red cross kit that I received my first night in quarantine I tried to break the razor open using the teeth of the comb. I was in the shower and my nails were too soft to do it by hand. Eventually the head of the razor snapped off the handle and the teeth of the comb got too mangled and I gave up in frustration and because I wanted to take it as a sign. 

It‚Äôs been about a year since my last anxiety attack. I had one today. I managed to keep it pretty mild and walked for about 2 miles until my heart beat calmed down. 2 miles is hard to do in quarantine. I just walked in loops around the inside of the fence. 

It all started with a conversation that made me a little bit uncomfortable so I tried to change the subject. Then it led to direct questions that made me extremely uncomfortable. Which led to a situation where everyone felt uncomfortable. This led to me coming back to my room and remembering every awful, horrible, demeaning, condescending, and violent thing done against me. Which led to my anxiety attack. Which then led to me walking around my quarantine building for 2 miles feeling like shit and remembering that I‚Äôm never ever going to make it to ok. That had me going back to my room to take a shower and try to wash the funk away. This then had me rationalizing how there‚Äôs no point to me trying to improve if it doesn‚Äôt matter. No matter how much I grow, and how much I experience, and how educated I‚Äôve become, and how impactful I try to be, or how impressive my resume is, or how happy my social media looks, I‚Äôll always come back to this. 
Finally, I tried to pry the blade out of a cheap disposable razor with the teeth of a comb that the Red Cross gave me my first night in quarantine, and my first night back in the US as I was fleeing from the coronavirus. And now I feel selfish and stupid as shit. But at least I‚Äôll make my three year record."
240,1,"Hello. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I have a family member on Meth. We are looking for ways to help her. She is in her 30's, a stay-at-home mom, and not a lot of money but the family is all pitching in to pay. Would prefer something on east coast so she near family but the focus is a long program for someone who is resitant to rehab but willing to try so she doesnt lose her kids. 

I have checked out the government find a rehab site but I trust reviews from real people who have recovered or know someone who has more. I am 9 months sober but I did not go to rehab and have a different addiction and am not a mom, so I dont know how to help besides this request and my emotional support.

Thank you again."
241,1,"As much as I envy those that can get high and have a good time, it‚Äôs really a good thing I don‚Äôt use anymore. People in meetings caught wind of what my bottom (most recent via substance abuse) looked like, but the picture is scattered among so many meetings over the course of my recovery that only a select few actually know why I don‚Äôt get high anymore.

For those of you that only have snippets, you‚Äôre in for a treat...or a cringe - all depends on how much time you have to read this. Feels like it‚Äôs gonna be a long one.

That‚Äôs what she said. üòë

Everyone in recovery has a bottom. Each bottom is similar in nature, but is very unique to each recovering individual. Some bottoms happen in a jail cell, some in a hospital gurney, some are a simple statement from a loved one - but they all trigger that ‚Äúperiodic jolt of reality‚Äù the literature mentions. That moment that we step outside of the shell we‚Äôve become and can look at it non-objectively, we experience a glimmer of freedom.

How strongly we fan that glimmer into a spark that ignites the fire to burn down the vessel we‚Äôve turned into and rebuild something new is all on the individual. Not to preach, but for recovery, you have to want it.

My first time in treatment was October 18, 2013. It‚Äôs now February 15, 2020 and I‚Äôm walking through my 22nd month clean. It‚Äôs taken time...lots of slips, lots of classes, meetings, functions, but mostly it took more ‚Äúresearch‚Äù as people call it. At the beginning of 2016 I had experienced what recovery and being clean was all about. Around 6 months clean, but I wasn‚Äôt done using. The relapse from that bit of recovery really laid out the red carpet to the bottom I actually needed.

I almost took this back 8 years but that would be side-questing a post inappropriately. üòõ Just gonna write about the spot I was in my last week(s) of getting high.

Delusional and paranoid is an understatement. The trap house was filled with so much stuff. Mom‚Äôs a hoarder, so we had walkways through the house just wide enough for walking and piles upon piles of stuff. Not gonna even get into the amount of rocks in the house...but it was ridiculous. The mess was overwhelming, and I was usually in my room. 5-6 days a week. I used part-time (once or twice a week) because my crazies caught up with me. As soon as I ingested anything, guilt, shame, remorse, regret, fear, panic - all flooded me within seconds and I would shut my door and hide. 

From what?

In my room, mom‚Äôs hoarding had covered every wall in the room. If I was too insecure to look all tweaky trying to straighten up, I would write or doodle. Doodling had a thrill when I relapsed, it was an escape and a boost of esteem to see what my brain puked on paper through my hands. Writing was very fun. The oddly inspired stories and concepts were captivating to write and read. But the fun was gone. I‚Äôd be stuck on my bed for hours or days in end. A majority of the time was spent fake sleeping, with a night light because of the inter-dimensional beings that lurked my room in the dark.

When my head trip was more sound than that; it was the neighbors, my brothers people that were a sketchy kind of weird, or the feds that were watching. Ears pressed to the door, glass against the wall, or a telescoping-snake-camera trying to get a glimpse at how uncomfortable I was. To alleviate stress of them breaching my room, I had everything pulled off of the walls about 2-4‚Äù so I could periodically check for drill holes or bugs of some sort.

There couldn‚Äôt be a mess. Like a pile of clothing - it would begin to take shape of faces. Like Hellraiser and Silent Hill style faces that would multiply with every heartbeat. Everything was folded up nicely, and even my blankets on the bed were folded at the ends so I could see the edge of them. If the blanket hung over the bed far enough that something could sneak up it, it did. So many nights fake sleeping, my blankets and clothes tried to strangle me.

You ever lay in bed, turn on your side and suddenly the top sheet is wrapped 3 times around your leg and your shirt is choking your armpit?

Made sleeping impossible, so most of the time I laid in one position until the inter-dimensional beings magnetized all the iron from my blood to my back or side. So I‚Äôd move and remake the bed. It got to the point that I was getting angry, and frightened to tears. 

All my mirrors and reflective surfaces were covered (picture frames, cups, pens) with blankets or socks to dull the reflections of light within the room...so I couldn‚Äôt see what was creeping around the edge of my bed, and they couldn‚Äôt use reflections to travel around my room.  Because I couldn‚Äôt see them, and knew they were trying to exploit my discomfort on closed circuit tv somewhere in the world, I was petrified.

With that background painted - the furniture off the walls, no light reflecting and mostly candles or nightlights illuminating my hell-hole, I was afraid to actually sleep because that‚Äôs when they would get me. They‚Äôd strangle me in my own bedding all Final Destination style, they‚Äôd possess someone in the house to take me out, whatever it was, I broke down. 

Stripped naked, in the fetal position on the floor of my room because they had somehow gotten in between my mattress/box spring and were closing in. At that point, if it was the feds that would have been a relief, because that‚Äôs something tangible. But nothing happened for hours. Felt like days went by in the course of a night because I had 4 blankets covering my window. Absolutely impenetrable by light or a camera snake.

The head trip was a regular thing, my room looked the same day in and night out. But being in that place, trusting anything impossible. I couldn‚Äôt even trust my Sharpies because they would get reflective enough to direct the candle-light into my eye.

That wasn‚Äôt the last time I got high either...is the really fucked up part of the whole thing. That was just that moment I realized that I had to do something. I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable enough for meetings, so I called the detox center (intro song to Cheers) and they scheduled me to go in the following week. Almost two weeks later, but I stayed clean that whole time until the morning of checking into detox.

This is how I remind myself that I can‚Äôt use successfully....some people can get high and just fuck everything off, and sometimes I envy the fun they have. But the fun runs out. I feel lucky it took less than a decade to hit that bottom I needed to actually do something in Life.

Thanks for the read."

245,1,"Last week I lost my mom to an accidental drug overdose. Even though i was raised by my grandma due to my mothers addiction, My mom has been my best friend since the day i was born, even when she served a 4 year prison sentence we were inseparable. These past few years have been the best, especially because she got sober. These past few months we got so close, went on trips together, and just last month ended up getting a house together. Most 20 year olds would be embarrassed to say they live with their mom but i was so excited and proud.

Three weeks ago my mother had a miscarriage and it was extremely hard on her. I guess about two weeks ago she relapsed. I didnt even notice until about two days before she passed that she was acting kind of off. Then the police came to our house and told me that she was gone. I had to plan the entire funeral pretty much by myself, my family is extremely death avoidant and especially in this situation since it was an overdose. 

I miss her so much. It doesnt even feel real that she is gone... Even though I saw her body. Even though i watched her be buried. I miss her laugh around the house, i miss dennys dates, and i miss her hugs. I keep wanting to text her and ask her what I should do, but i have her phone. Im writing this on her ipad. The last thing I talked to her about was this ipad, i called her and asked where is was. She said that she had it and she would be home soon... The last thing that I said was, ‚ÄúI love you, be safe.‚Äù She never came home, after 1am i started to get worried and i knew something was wrong, but the worst i expected was jail, not death.

 Everything happened so fast, too fast. And I cant handle it. I feel so alone. I am terrified to leave the house, I‚Äôm extremely paranoid, i‚Äòm angry, i‚Äôm sad. I feel like it‚Äôs my fault because I didn‚Äôt notice sooner, and when I did I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I still don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want my mom. üòû"

252,1,"Hey my name is Talissah and I am a addict. I started smoking weed when I was 17 I went out myself and found someone to smoke with in his car one night. I ditched a good friended mine that I was supposed to stay the night with to go out and get high for the first time. Or so I thought. The first time I smoked weed was not the first time I got high. After that night that‚Äôs all I thought about and my curiosity on the high was all I thought about for a long time. Until about two weeks later when I went with a very close friend of mine to go hang out with two of her close guy friends. I had no clue that the man I met was going to be someone who was soon to be a huge influence on my life. Me and this man hung out nearly everyday and all we would do was smoke and get high. I had an amazing foster family and I had everything that I ever wanted but I still fucked them over by lying, stealing and betraying them. Words cannot express how sorry I am for all the shit I put them trough and they were still there and they put up with it. For that I am so thankful. I ran away for this man that I was with about three times. Just to be able to get High without being looked down on or judged. The last time I ran away was for good and that‚Äôs when my life turned completely upside down. I ran away with him to Phoenix I was still 17. We stayed at his real moms apartment since I was underage and a runaway I couldn‚Äôt get a actual job so I started to sell myself. No this is not something I am proud of but it is my past and it was a road that I CHOSEN to walk down. Soon after that I started to use Meth. I only had used for about three weeks but that was enough to plant the seed for a whole lot of issues. His mom soon kicked us out because we were using so I moved to mammoth with my cousin and her friend‚Äôs family. We slept on their back porch for about six months smoking weed all day everyday. Then one day I tried to kill myself so I was hospitalized in a mental health facility until I turned 18 because I had no one to be released to. When I got out I took a pregnancy test and as history goes it was positive. When his mom found out that she was having her first grandchild she took us in and we moved into her house in Tucson for my pregnancy and a few months after. I had used marijuana until I was about 5 months pregnant then I stopped. Like I said I am not proud of this but it‚Äôs what i had chose. May of 2019 we got our own apartment in Phoenix. We had it all full time jobs a place and our perfect little family. But if you‚Äôre a addict you will know that no matter how good you have it you‚Äôll always have that itch that you want to scratch. Sadly for us we scratched and kept scratching until it took it all away. We stared to use meth again about a month a half after we moved and he lost his job and it was just one bad comedown after another. It blows my mind that I actually thought that we, that I, could live like that until the end of time. My poor son got some shit parents. He didn‚Äôt deserve to be put through everything that we put him through. Most people have nothing but bad to say about DCS but I am so grateful that they got a call. If it wasn‚Äôt for them my son would still be a terrible situation and we would still be using. I wish I could say it was easy to quit and I quit after they took my son. Sadly that wasn‚Äôt the case. I probably relapsed about 10 times before this last time. The last time I had relapsed I stared to use herion. I am not proud of all the choices I‚Äôve made but I made them all and I will work my ass off and try every thing I can possibly do to get my family back and better than it was. I am currently 47 days sober and 100% dedicated to my recovery and getting my son back. Yes I know 47 days isn‚Äôt much but I had to start somewhere. I am so proud of myself and I know one day the time will come when all these drug classes that take four days a week, all these random U/A that I do twice a week, all these parent aid classes that I do weekly and working my full time factory job 6 days a week will eventually pay off because I will have my son back and I will recover to a point where I stop counting my sober days and I can take it year by year and not day by day. Because one day my son will look up to me a be proud and know how much he is loved and how he will now forever come before any drug, and any person and any problem. Do I think weed was my gateway drug? Yes and I pray that anyone who abuses it or smokes it illegally gets help or finds the strength to stop before it‚Äôs too late and if you think is just weed then I hope that you have the courage and maturity to realize that it does so much more harm than it‚Äôs worth and you find a way out before it becomes more and takes everything."

267,1,"Sometimes I experience post acute withdrawal symptoms as can be expected in early recovery . I also often struggle to H.A.L.T. when I'm feeling hungry angry lonely or tired and that's ok with me too.  Relearning behavior patterns and traits and attempting to change surely doesn't happen overnight.   I'm new to early recovery because every time I attempt recovery life is different .  I never new I was addicted to beautiful healthy wonderful women üòÇü§£ is that a bad thing ? Sometimes I've been attracted to beautiful unhealthy wonderful women as well when I was drinking .  I am currently trying to decompress from taking on way to much stress and I've often tried to help other people who don't want or need my help .  Best friends,people in early recovery, people with a longtime in recovery I attempt to bring joy and happiness to their lives . I can't be sorry for trying to be a helpful person but maybe I should be.  I'm learning I have issues with boundaries and I tend to not show enough respect for other people's boundaries . I've always been a people pleaser and I'm learning I don't have to be that way any longer.   I'm very greatful today for a large list of things that I won't put on here.  Everyday I have to remember to stay humble and be full of gratitude it is a bummer when other people who don't know me think I'm full of bologny soup.  I should never care what other people think about me when I'm doing the best I can .   Why must everyone be so judgemental I know being human is constant judgement and today my comfortable athletic shoes provide a balance of newness some times shoes are keeping my away from booze.   They may be old shoes and not what the cool guys wear but they are comfortable and help me remain humble. I'm lucky to still have shoes.  They also help me to remember to walk away from situations I may feel uncomfortable in .  I write here to vent my frustrations and I'm sure many people have felt just like I do .  Today is day 115 and I'm thinking I'm doing as well as can be expected .  Some wonderful people choose to go away for a year to get help .  I'm choosing to do it the all natural way with a ""Higher Power""  and by attempting to follow all suggestions I receive in the rooms.  Awesome. Behavior. Outside. Understanding. Trying.  Is something I'm very much ABOUT !  Sometimes on the inside I hurt and feel way to much and I say this to shall pass everything will be OK.  Thank you for reading and I  appreciate and have much respect for your recovery .  One +One therapy is or as some people may call it one on one with a licensed professional is the best especially if your willing to be honest and open and attempt to participate actively in your recovery .  I must remember everyone usually looks at both sides of a coin and some folks just see a coin and say oh I'll throw that coin in my collection and while some other people may think this Coin I have represents the hardest battle I've ever fought my battle to stop drinking and my battle to dissolve my addictive thinking ."

276,1,So I had almost 2 years and I relapsed a month ago. I recently got hired at a rehab as a house manager and honestly it‚Äôs killing me. I hate the overnights and the shifts are 12 hours.

278,1,"  Why Miracle recovery I suppose because I'm lucky to be alive after a suicide attempt when I was 6 years old and stuck a knife in an electrical socket with my tongue on it too.   That was my first and last and only attempt to consciously hit the off button .  I've also been on the ground violently convulsing after sucking in a whole balloon of Helium (oxygen deprivation is bad) I started floating away but my bro's brought me home friends who were calling my name next to me while I was shaking violently on the ground and trying to eat gravel or shaking my head in the way only epileptic people know or do.  I was 10 or 12 when that occurred then me and the boys walked 3 miles home I remember we found a Marlbro in an empty pack on the walk home and we split it writing sure helps me remember stuff.  MUSH LOVE TOO SOAPY AND YOJIMBO SATRON MAY HAVE BEEN THERE TOO.  So heres my story real quick smoked weed partied from 12-37 used lot's and lot's of stuff opiates,mdma ,weed oh man I miss marryjane the most .  Beers booze a little bit of benzos random trippy substances and a few other things .  I was diagnosed bipolar at age 16 after smoking the dust of angels Aka PCP .  I flipped out started raking leaves in the backyard naked because it felt right and I was surely in a drug induced psychosis .  I was also drinking my own piss because someone told me that if you drink your own urine it produces powerful drug like effects and shit I liked being high and completely crazy .   I did that maybe 2 times could be 3 if I could remember every little detail .  I ended up in the junior wing of a psyche ward .  I was the oldest kid there I was nuts they gave me valium like candy or something I CAN'T remember what pills they gave me I can remember flipping out and fighting to stay alive at least that's what I thought and then down the road of Depakote zombie for 2 years 2400 milligrams was lot's I've been told .  Fast forward over doses and flight decks or grey skull or psyche wards whatever you wanna call them only when using way to many drugs or trying to stop using drugs cold turkey .  If I went to the rooms of 12 step programs I'd get the help I needed and feel better .  Currently I take nothing honestly because I don't trust Dr's and I've researched the DSM 5 the thing they use most often to diagnose mental illness is bullshit according to some new study in Liverpool England.   I am currently sometimes way to sensitive or get angry easily and I feel that may be normal for someone who partied or used substances to cope with life for so long .  I was sexually /physically/emotionally abused too .  A few people growing up did some BAD shit to me .  I still wanna go and see my original abuser try to find him some kid who was I don't know 3 or 4 years older then me and ask him what the fuck .  I don't wanna hurt him or anything bad I'd like to thank him for setting me up for a wild and crazy life that I thought was normal .   I've traveled the world made tons of friends perhaps influenced people for the negative and the positive as only a man like me can .  The current struggle is real sometimes I dislike people strongly and I may even judge to harshly and I see pure truth in ways most people will never understand .    When I have some time off stuff aka weed beer opiates I come back to normalcy after a few months .  My most recent experience in a Psyche ward helped me earn some extra powerful  PTSD. I felt like a fish in a tank or a rat in a cage or a Bull in a Crystal store with many people talking to me and treating me as if I was a second class citizen or if I was a kid in kindergarten and they had sock puppets for hands.  I'm not super smart but 58√ó7=406 that took 2 maybe 1 second I CAN'T count in .5 seconds üòÇ  I've read many many books and they have helped me on this great journey of life I'm living .  I currently struggle to behave and act normally and shit I've always had that struggle even before the age of  using my first drug or drink .  I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar struggles and how they cope .  I've lived through some other traumatic PTSD stuff saving lives when I can but never feeling the gravity of the situation .  I hurt deep inside sometimes and at other times I choose to put my sad feelings on hold and go cold.  Who wants to feel sad or shitty when they don't have to is that bipolar is that addiction .  I know I dislike sunless winters and I'm sure I once ate 100mg of rittalen and slept for I forget 2 days or 36 hours .  I'm currently on day 44 or something I messed up and tried some herbal Artesia as a spiritual experience and shit I'm still very spiritual .  I'm lucky blessed greatful and thank God everyday that I'm still alive .  Has anyone had similar experiences or any guidance wisdom advice should I try meds I've taken many and they always seem to help me feel less inteligent dull sluggish and stupid .  Thc-P is a real strong chemical I wish I could go back to medical marijuana .  Maybe someday I will who knows 1 day at a time . LSD that stuff FUCKS you up if you take it on YOUR FATHER IN HEAVENS BIRTHDAY I feel like right now he has my back more then most would ever imagine or understand ."

I've been trying to seek out a residential treatment in the US for my depression, PTSD and binge eating disorder.

Does anyone know a place that primarily focuses on mental health? I have found tons of addiction treatment centers and dual diagnosis centers, and that's amazing, but not what I'm looking for.

Now a little over a decade later I realize the goals I want to reach (a graduate degree in neuropsychology among others) are gonna be hard to reach if I‚Äôm smoking weed and drinking alcohol. I quit meth and coke cold turkey when I found out I was pregnant with my first daughter, and I never looked back. Thru both pregnancies I was sober bcuz it was necessary, but when I gave birth went back to drinking again. 
I put weed on this pedestal, like it‚Äôs some magical healing plant that can do no wrong, but honestly it *really* aggravates the mental disorder I have and sends my anxiety thru the roof. 

I want to be able to cope with life‚Äôs stressors completely sober. I don‚Äôt use nicotine, I ended my love affair with alcohol a little while ago, and my last crutch has been cannabis.

But I wasn't ready to come back honestly and I didn't know that at the time how triggering my home town was to me. I haven't worked it all out yet. 

I relapsed two days ago and I don't want to break my mom's heart all over again. She knows I'm going to treatment for longer very soon and I haven't necessarily completed treatment yet as I am transferring. 

I don't want my family to find out I relapsed on there own I want to tell them but do so in a way where I can be honest without them getting upset. I feel like I need to be honest with them because I never was honest during my drug use.

286,1,Can any one tell me the average salary of a recovery coach 2020?
287,1,"Hey folks. I guess I'd best start with some context.

At 10 years old, I got myself put face to face with a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, Depression, and General Anxiety Disorder. Eventually, I was put on 54mg Concerta (Methylphenidate), 4mg Intuniv (Guanfacine) and 40mg Citalopram, and I'd been riding on that chemical soup until about 8 months ago. I am 19 now, and have stopped all three as I am going into secondary education and I can't afford both.

Coming off was hard. I was a little dumb with the methods. I tapered off of the Intunive, but went pretty much cold-turkey with both the Concerta and Citalopram. After that ordeal was dealt with though, I felt like I could handle being off of them.

I've noticed something a little unsettling, though. While I was on my meds, my focus was clear and intense, but so were my emotions. I was often either irratable, or manic. Hardly anything else.

Now that I am off of them, two things are happening. 

One, I am being reintroduced to feelings of anxiety and fear and sadness which I have been virtually without for years. It is difficult to process those emotions when I have been able to ignore them for so long.

Two. I've recognized that I am having alot of difficulty forming emotional bonds like I used to. The bonds I form between people have become more superficial, and more tenuous. I am not sure if this is just me having a clearer view of my relationships or if my ability to maintin meaningful relationships has actually degraded, or if this is just how relationships become when one enters adulthood? I'm still learning and trying to figure that out.

I have also found myself in more intense states of boredom and malaise as of late, but it's not severe.

Anyways, sorry for the long start. My question is this. For anyone who has used medications long-term, have you had any similar experiences? Do you have any strategies to combat these experiences? Am I possibly looking in the wrong place?

Thanks for sticking through and reading all of that. I look forward to any suggestions."

290,1,"does anyone else struggle with feelings of extreme dissociation from who they used to be pre-recovery? 

i've been ""clean"" from obsessive thinking and suicidal thoughts for over six months, since i upped my dose of prozac. since then i can't seem to feel connected at all to the person i was during my dark times. how do i hold myself accountable for bad shit i did if i feel like a different person did it? how do i prevent myself from slipping into the same patterns again?"
291,1,"I haven‚Äôt seen my children in almost a month now due to my drinking. I wasn‚Äôt drinking around them, but nevertheless, I knew that I needed to maintain absolute sobriety in order to see them. One is 9 months, and the other is 2 years. 
In addition, I go to jail at the end of the month for 30 days due to a third DUI. Alcohol Court reduced my sentence by 250 days. 
I have a sponsor and I attend AA meetings and individual therapy. But things are so difficult right now. I currently live with my friend and her 6 kids. Grateful to have a roof over my head, but it‚Äôs chaotic.

293,1,"I was addicted to xanax for 6 months of daily use (went from daily 0.5 to 4-6mg/day), then continued on and off for another 4 months. I relapsed in last spring and used ativan frequently (4 months of use, maybe 3-5x a week). I stopped in August 2019, entirely, after tapering off extremely slowly under a doctor's supervision (took about 2 months) but I had one lapse in January (0.5mg ativan). No benzos since.

For a while I was really happy. I quit drinking, exercised a lot, got back into school, started to learn a new language. But then I found some articles showing the link between extended benzo abuse and early onset/development of dementia and alzheimers.

I feel so unbelievably depressed thinking about my future now. I feel like there's nothing I can do to repair my brain. I don't want to use but a small part of me is egging me on since ""you're going to go crazy anyway, might as well have fun on the way.""

I feel so horrible though, I live with my girlfriend whose pregnant with child and I've been sneaking around, getting high and using in the house. I don't want to be doing this and I can't tell her about this. I just want to get off kratom and not relapse on that shit anymore. Its gonna be hard giving up weed too.

‚ÄúJoy comes from living the way my conscience tells me to live.‚Äù

Lombard, Illinois, February 1995, ‚ÄúThe Most Beautiful Word in the English Language,‚Äù, In Our Own Words"
304,1,"**Skip the backstory if you want, the main question will be in bold**

I used to be an addict. I said it. I never admitted it before, I told myself it was a phase or I could just stop, but my drug use got so bad at uni, and I ended up in hospital a number of times. It didn't stop there, although I did recover for a while. I basically never went back to my job after walking out one day (id been off for weeks due to anxiety and depression anyway), then I finally got a hold of myself when I went back home. But I relapsed and my parents found out when a parcel came whilst they were at home, with something like ketamine in. So not only did they know I was addicted to pain meds and benzodiazepines, they also realised I was into harder stuff. I took speed for weeks to try and lose weight because it decreased my appetite, but my skin became terrible and my heart was always beating so fast. Once I ran out I didn't dare order more because my Dad had threatened to call the police if he ever caught me ordering drugs again.

Anyway, after that I stopped. I saw the pain and sadness in my mother, the anger and pain in my father, the confusion in my sister. I had problems still with depression and my next job didn't work out, I couldn't stand the managers and I just hated it, made me sick with anxiety and I was in so much pain from standing all day that I almost relapsed back to pain meds, especially when I saw my Dads zapain pills (which has codeine in, something I was addicted to). So I didn't request to go back (it was a temp job, they asked me to stay on, I said no). Then I went through a lot, 6 months went by without a job, I don't remember that period of my life much, just that I was at the job center lying about my job searches and spent all my time in bed just completely out of it (but not on drugs). I do believe at one point I took too many paracetamol on purpose, made myself sick, told my Mum, don't remember much after that. But I finally got a job.

It was tough at first, heavy lifting whilst stacking shelves, and I was in a lot of pain, I didn't think i'd handle it, but over 6 months later I am over 2 stone lighter, completely clean of drugs, living out of my parents with possible ADHD (I have an evaluation later this month), so that's a struggle. But I'm doing it. My impulses to spend money are still there, which sometimes I give into so am looking into how to save properly, but ultimately I am doing okay for myself. I struggle at my job sometimes because of unempathetic management, and I struggle to get myself out and about when I have time off, but I'm doing it. I've had cravings but I haven't given in. 

**However, even though I am at least 7 months clean, doing well, having minimal cravings, is relapse inevitable? I hear that most people relapse a good few times, and I am low key worried it might happen to me.**  **I saw an article that says ""**Only about a third of people who are abstinent less than a year will remain abstinent."" **Which means I have a good chance of relapse, despite not feeling like I am going to. Is it possible to remain clean and never relapse? I never want to disappoint my family like that again and I feel like if I ever relapse I will just kill myself. It's just not something I ever want to go through again, ever. I'm only 23, female, and I just want to pick myself up and live a life drug free. Is that possible?**"
305,1,"""We must learn how to act rather than react. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve had lots of training at reacting. And we‚Äôre all such good imitators. We are a society of reactors.

311,1,"The day I decided to get clean from heroin was the day i started living. We all die one day but the real question is are all living? Live your life the way it makes u healthy and happy. You already took the first step by taking control of your life away from your addiction....take charge fully. You control you and only you do. It took me 15+ years of addiction of opiates and heroin to realize my happiness depends on ME and the decisions i make the people i allow apart of my life. I never thought I see this day. There is nothing wrong with getting help whether it drug therapy or inpaitent.  When I was on drugs I blamed my unhappiness on everyone and everything.  It was never my fault when ultimately it was all my fault.  
Take control of your life and who is allowed a part of it. Negativity attracts negativity. Do goo, think good, good things will come your way. üíûüíûüíûüíû"
312,1,"I've heard countless people say they tossed their vapes only to ask their friend if they could hit theirs 10 minutes later.

I've been able to quit weed and alcohol for years with it still around my house. I've had other times where I tossed weed and my smoking utensils and later had to buy them over again.

I've learned my lesson not to ever throw anything away,

But I'm kind of desperate. I feel negative effects from vaping, been only doing it for less than 2 months, wait for 4 days one time and went back just because I missed the sport of it. Now the addiction feels stronger after weeks back on. Vaping basically makes me feel like I'm at risk of a stroke or heart attack, my chest feels pressure, and I'm also noticing the right side of my face's nerves tingle at times. I hope the face think is just because of stress.

But should I destroy my vape? or just quit and hide it somewhere? I have found that about 30 minutes later I forget all about wanting to quit and think all the negative things about vaping will not come back."

I‚Äôm not sure why or how I came up with that number. It just made sense then. Almost every year until now I‚Äôve experienced some sort of dip into depression. I was diagnosed with BPD. And it‚Äôs been hell. I‚Äôm 24 now. And I just realized that this past year, was the first year of like my ‚Äúadult‚Äù life which I haven‚Äôt not once, ACTUALLY contemplated suicide. It wasn‚Äôt an easy year at all. And this wasn‚Äôt an accident. I went to therapy for years and every day I need to catch myself. It‚Äôs easier for me to fall into depression than it is for me to show other emotions including anger or love to myself. And it‚Äôs been a hard journey to self love. But this is very surreal for me. I didn‚Äôt notice than an entire year went by. I wasn‚Äôt counting days or months. I just took every day, one at a time. And now I just noticed that it‚Äôs been a year since the last time I self harmed. And it‚Äôs fucking insane. Thought I‚Äôd share and spread some love and hope. Things can get better."

318,1,"I‚Äôm posting this now, so that hopefully I‚Äôll see it in the morning. Every time I use, whether it‚Äôs alcohol or drugs (my d.o.c‚Äôs have turned to the harder side of things, as I‚Äôve gotten less social over the years and the only things i know how to get are boy [always fent] and the harder side of girl).

I‚Äôll always sit here on my phone, looking up NA meetings the next day, and never follow through. I was doing good around thanksgiving, barely and drink and no drugs. I was in between jobs, but started drinking again when I started my current job. Cue the occasional use of drugs since then. 

I‚Äôm not scared of dying, I really don‚Äôt take things too far. I‚Äôm just scared of waking up in 10 years and still doing the same shit. In November I was recovering from and awful period of depression and going to therapy. Quit that for valid finanical reasons, but have made no effort to get back on that road since I‚Äôve gotten back to having a steady income. I‚Äôve got some life goals I really want to accomplish by the end of the year, but am afraid that if I keep abusing substances I won‚Äôt even start on any of them. 

Here we are on Feb. 5th, and tomorrow I‚Äôm cutting a rent check without having money in the bank. My rent is only $325 now that I let someone move into my extra bedroom, and i bring home like $400 a week. I‚Äôm playing the whole ‚Äúwell they never cash it til the 14th so whatever‚Äù game. Knowing that I‚Äôve spent +300 plus on alcohol and drugs every week in January. And I haven‚Äôt even enjoyed them. The drugs in my town are notoriously  weak, which is why I have to spend so much on what I call half-a-habit. 

I‚Äôm sitting here knowing I won‚Äôt fall asleep for a few hours, browsing reddit and beating myself up at the same time. But it‚Äôs not productive, because I seem to do this 2-3 times a week. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm fighting 2 sides of myself daily, there‚Äôs the rational part, and then the part that sensationalizes drugs and alcohol. It‚Äôs getting lame, and I just want to stop that nagging fucking feeling that I need to use in order to take up my time.

Hey everyone, this is JeSuisLaBanane‚Äôs older brother. He‚Äôs real name was Steve. Yesterday afternoon he lost his lifelong battle with heroin addiction, just one day after his 21st birthday. 

After he didn‚Äôt meet me for lunch yesterday afternoon I went over to check on him. I found him unresponsive on his bed with the needle still in his arm. He was blue and unresponsive he had a pulse but it was weak and fading fast. I called 911, administered 4mg of Naloxone and started rescue breaths. 

I‚Äôm so sorry I couldn‚Äôt save you baby brother. If only I had been there 20 minutes sooner maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this. God knows I tried everything in my power to save you but I couldn‚Äôt.

You had so much to live for. God why would you let this happen? Why him and not me? I would give my life for his in an instant.

Steve was a beautiful person wise beyond his years, with a heart of pure gold. I only wish he would of learned to love himself as much as he loved everyone else. My world is completely and utterly shattered. I‚Äôm sitting here in his apartment going through all his things and looking at all the old pictures of us and our friends on his phone. This can‚Äôt be real. We just talked yesterday morning. I wouldn‚Äôt have hung up if I knew that would be the last time I heard your voice and that infectious laugh that everybody loved and cherished. I wouldn‚Äôt have let you go when I hugged you goodbye on Monday after we celebrated your 21st birthday together. Monday you were still clean, and today you are no longer here.

Mom is completely broken. Dad hasn‚Äôt uttered a word since I called and told him the news. I know they never understood this life that you lived, but I know it‚Äôs not the one you chose. I just wish you were able to let go of all the pain you held in your heart. I wish you would have let us hold that pain with you.

I know things happened when we were growing up that you just felt like you couldn‚Äôt move pass. And I know this is how you dealt with it, and know I am not mad at you, just hurt and agonized that you‚Äôre no longer here. 

I know how badly you wanted to stay clean and how hard you tried, I will never doubt that you gave your all for recovery. 

Me, Jesse, Mikey and the rest of your NA brothers and sisters will continue to fight this insidious disease of addiction one day at a time in your memory. 

With his passing Steve leaves behind a loving mother and father two little sisters, a beautiful 3 year old daughter, and endless amounts of loving friends. 

Rest Easy baby brother‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº

I will love you forever, in this life and whatever comes after this.

If you took the time to read this I want to say thank you for reading. And if you are struggling with addiction and have the desire for a new way of life, just know that recovery is possible for you. You CAN choose LIFE! It will not be easy, and it will be a daily sometimes hourly, sometimes moment to moment battle for your life, but recovery is possible! I hope everyone who read this and everyone struggling with addiction makes it through another day.

God bless you all."
321,1,Since recovering I've been gaining quite a bit of weight. Was wondering what tools y'all use to cope with the addiction part of the brain. I'm pretty much addicted to sugar right now and need something else to help
323,1,"A little back story to explain my situation

I am a meth addict still in recovery. I have been sober for two months thanks to the rehab center that took me in. I was having manic episodes that they were not equipped to handle and recently they transferred me over to an adult psychiatric facility for cocuring disorders. 

I stayed there for 5 days and was diagnosed Bipolar 1 Mania with psychotic features. I am going to be sent to a new rehab center in the next week or two and in the meantime go back to my home until I am approved to go.

I live in a small town and my whole life there revolved around my drug use and it is going to be extremely triggering to return there. All of my friends who aren't really my friends use and I am sure I am going to encounter at least one of them while I am there.

I plan on going to na or aa groups as often as possible and I am going to try to keep myself busy doing house work or finding sober people to hangout with. But I am worried that will not be enough. Because at the end of the day I will still be within half a mile of the drug I so desperately am wanting to forget about yet still have some desire to want to partake again.

Don't tell me relapse is a normal thing for us all to go through because I don't want to believe there will come a day I will use again and make the tradition of relapsing an excuse for that behavior. 

Just to get me through until I can go to rehab without relapsing what would you suggest?

My mania is something I have lived with for a while and I find that everytime I start to have an episode there is a drive that I develop to want to engage in risky adrenaline inducing behavior and I haven't learned how to cope with that really. 

So in general and just in case I go through an episode where I will have a desire to engage in risky behavior again what should I do?

Please be specific and feel free to write as much as you want. Even if a positive affirmation is all you have that will help"
325,1,"I relapsed after 500+ days last August. After that I had no therapist, no close friends and no programs to help me quit and I did it all on my own. I quit doing drugs. These past 3 months I've had a girlfriend help me too.

327,1,"Hey, I've been sober from narcotics for 1 month and I'm much happier. I graduated, and I have an interview for a job involving my degree that has a sort of decent pay, but I'm also getting my roommates and I evicted (probably) due to my former addiction. We go to court Thursday and the best argument I can give to the court is that we can pay the past due rent with our tax returns.  I'm a single mom with almost no family help and I don't know what I'm going to do if I can't even rent a place to live. I've been feeling lots of shame and regret and mostly, I know I could lose more time with my daughter (her dad and I have partial custody), if I lose my place.

I‚Äôm coming up on my second anniversary and my spiritual fitness feels depleted. I‚Äôm cranky and judgmental. I‚Äôm quick to anger. That lightness and Serenity feels so far away. I‚Äôm talking to my sponsor, working with my sponsee, going to meetings, reading literature, and sharing in meetings. 

Has anyone else experienced these crises around the time of their anniversaries? 

Anyone with some experience, strength, and hope?

Thanks for letting me share tonight. I am a very grateful recovering alcoholic and addict and I have no desire to drink or use."
329,1,"I was depressed for 5 years and that really took a toll on me. It was between the age of 18 and til I turned 24. I lost my personality and my happiness and didn‚Äôt know what was me and what was my depression, since I didn‚Äôt know who I was anymore.

My depression was deep and cold and lasted for so many years that I truly forgot who I was. And I forgot what happiness felt like and how warmth and connection to others felt. I was suicidal and isolated. Had developed social phobia after the incidents that traumatized me deeply. Was totally isolated and had anxiety and panic attacks pretty much through out the days the first year.  I was crying constantly. Cried when I woke up, cried when I got dressed, when I brushed my teeth and when I walked to school. A lot of time I had to turn back because my tears never stopped running so I couldn‚Äôt go to class. 

I started taking drugs and drank a lot to escape my feelings and miserable reality. I became addicted to the escape. I really do wish I had reached out for help but I didn‚Äôt see the point in that since I had planned to end my life anyway.  

Nothing became better no matter what I did. When I hung out with people I felt like an alien and couldn‚Äôt connect. My anxiety always skyrocketed and i hated my incapability to socialize and I could feel that my energy was draining others. 

When I laughed I felt nothing. When I hugged someone, I didn‚Äôt feel any love. My body and mind never experienced love, affection or joy for years and there is really no reason to live when you can‚Äôt experience any of those feelings. 

But now, for one year now, things have been better. I can feel connected to others, feel close and share moments of love and energy. I enjoy intimacy and closeness and I‚Äôm able to feel appreciated. All of these things are soooo beautiful. Like I can‚Äôt even explain how very beautiful it feels, especially since I haven‚Äôt experienced this in years. I begin to feel as if I‚Äôm awakening into life again. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to see who I am. Everyone grows so much between the years of 18 to 24 and starts their own lives and I have just been going backwards. I am getting to know myself at the age of 25 and that is pretty cool actually. What i like, my social roll in different groups, at work and my personality. I am growing everyday and I have already come so far and I‚Äôm am doing things I never thought I would be able to do. Just small things as meeting new people and enjoying to get to know new people, something I was terrified of just a year ago. I‚Äôve started to go to a choir, something my social anxiety prevented me from doing before. I am very proud of all of these steps. Maybe small to some but I am flourishing from all these experiences. I may be behind others but I am going in the right direction. I am rediscovering my hobbies and growing socially, gaining friends and becoming better at opening myself up and sharing my feelings and thoughts.

I hope you all soon will experience the feeling of love and joy again. It will come back. Even if you don‚Äôt believe it, it will come back. You will feel appreciated and loved. You will find life meaningful again. 

I‚Äôm curious to know what others who got out of depression appreciate now! What are you able to enjoy now? Tell me about where you find beauty. What are you able to feel? What have you learned about yourself? What steps are you taking? What are you rediscovering in life?

You are so valuable and loved. Never give up."

332,1,"I have problem, and I have known about it for a while now. I don‚Äôt drink often but when I do it leads me to drink excessive quantities and then I find harder drugs. I work a traveling job but I can still find whatever I‚Äôm looking for wherever I am. Then after I realize my problem I will quit for a few weeks and then starting socially drinking again and then boom it happens again. I just need to talk to someone"

334,1,"I am not going to get too detailed at this time as I am very weary . I am now 36 hours crack and alcohol free and the cravings and images of a crack stem or beer to my lips is overwhelming. I havent had any sobre time since I was 12 years old (32/m) minus stints in detox and rehab. My longest bout of sobriety was when I was  in prison n they were both only 6 month bouts. I have tried everything. But I always go back to the bottle which then leads to the cocaine cravings ultimately winning me over, which ultimately leads to insane cocaine binges lasting 4 to 5 days. My family has(had) money and have even given me my own home to live in and they bail me out 3-4000 dollar debts with dealers. I have drained them completely. I have lost everything. I am writing this as I lay on my mother's couch shaking and wondering what I can do different this time?;( My head is shot from the crazy psychosis episodes I've gone through. My body seems as though it can't take anymore of these binges. No food or water just alcohol and cocaine for several days a week. Absolutely everything I've done or enjoyed doing in my life I've done under the influence of something. This is only the tip of the iceberg, I've lost everyone and everything, I've burned more bridges than I can count. I've attempted overdoses a few times now to escape this world the only way I know how to live in this world. I've stumbled upon this site last night and the support seemed so amazing. Thank you in advance for any advice."
335,1,"I am not sure if this should be here or in r/relationships so I am sorry if this is in the wrong place. I recently came back to NA after a relapse (11 days clean), however I am doing SLAA (Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous) and SAA (Sex Addicts Anonymous) due to my sex addiction as well. I am not sure how to go about ending this relationship. She knows about NA but not me being a sex addict. I do not want to give her too many details as I do not want to hurt her, but I cannot drag her with me while I learn how to be in a relationship. Additionally, she has given me money that I did not ask for, but took after I lost a job as I was about to lose my home. I want to pay her back but cannot pay her in full at the moment. She is expecting me to stay the night tonight and I know I cannot hide my desire to end this relationship much longer. It is just not fair to her. Anyone have experience with something similar or have productive advice?"
336,1,"I (21 f) recently started dating a guy (24m) who is in recovery and has been sober for almost two years. He‚Äôs worked all the steps, all that good stuff, and is in a great place. He always emphasizes communication, honesty, and openness with my, which i value. We both have our own past that we have worked through and grown from (he has recovery, I have counseling though Title IX issues), and I feel like we are both in a please for. Healthy relationship. However, I want to make sure I can be the best I can be for him, because I really like him. Is there any advice you have for dating an addict in recovery?"

‚ÄúTrying to understand God's miracles and why he performs them, at least for this alcoholic, is something better left to God. I need only say ‚ÄòThank you.‚Äô‚Äù

New Haven, Conn., April 1992, ‚ÄúThree Years Tomorrow,‚Äù, AA Grapevine"
343,1,"January 30, 2020

‚ÄúI recalled the part of chapter five that says ‚Äòno human power could have relieved our alcoholism.‚Äô And that God could and would, if he were sought. This became my answer.

‚ÄúI sent God into those dark places within my subconscious. It was there I seemed to store painful memories, those of my childhood in an alcoholic home, and those of my own alcoholism and drug abuse ‚Äòadventures.‚Äô I asked my Higher Power to take his healing light into those painful areas of my subconscious that seemed to be carefully and deeply buried.‚Äù

Corona del Mar, Calif., April 1992, ‚ÄúA Healing Light,‚Äù, AA Grapevine"
345,1,"So I‚Äôve dealt with severe codependency my entire life. Like I would get sucked into a guy and just straight up become them, or whatever person I had to be to keep their interest. It wasn‚Äôt conscious. Led me all the way to becoming wholly and completely addicted to a narcissistic sociopathic drug addict. That, unsurprisingly, led to severe psychological trauma. 

At that time I was working a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (read: fun but highly exploitative) job in the music/club scene. I helped throw some of the hottest parties in the region and traveled regionally throwing impromptu after parties with an artist I managed. Life was ‚Äúgood‚Äù til the trauma. 

The trauma eventually led me to learn how to actually heal and process my childhood so its effects began to permanently dissolve. Because I‚Äôm taking the tough road and doing the healing work instead of running from myself, I‚Äôm finding happiness, but it‚Äôs nothing like the escapism. It‚Äôs more sustainable and I‚Äôm slowly putting my life back together, sure. And even though I mostly experience depression I am beginning to find joy in daily life again. But..... every so often I come across a song or something that reminds me of how the escapism felt. The parties. The guys. The narcissist. He was the highest high of my LIFE. And god when it hits me, sometimes I just fucking miss how blissfully I coasted through life... even though it was totally delusional, it came from a place of earth shattering childhood pain, and I was effectively stockholmed with the music industry. (I‚Äôm sorry.. I know that is a strong term, but that‚Äôs why I use it)

Anyway... it‚Äôs all a really emotional process. I left behind all but one friend (because everyone from that scene was so toxic) and it is hard not to have anyone to talk about these feelings with. Can anyone relate? :/"
347,1,I'm approaching my one-year alcohol free this Saturday. I'm incredibly proud of myself and want to honor this milestone with self care and gratitude. I do not attend AA - Recovery Dharma is my jam. Anyone have any ideas or ways that they've celebrated major milestones? Thanks in advance!

349,1,"Long story short I had ppd and ppa when I had my son got on meds that saved my life. I started drinking heavy when stress came up and now or I was drinking every day till black out. I didn't realize this would also effect my SSRI so I'm back at square one. One min I'm ok the next I'm fucking hysterically crying. I dont even really want to drink other than to pass out. 

How long will the crawl out of my skin panic attacks stop?

When do the night sweats stop? 

I have suicidal thoughts almost constantly."
351,1,"An old friend  messaged me tonight out of the blue. Haven't talked to her in probably 10 years ...but I have heard this pitch before... hey ""massguy66"" how've you been? I knew if in the next 2 responses she asked for $ it was for heroin. After a bit I knew what was up and I said sry i cant help I know what you've been into and I'm here to help and to offer advice but I won't contribute to your addiction. I got a loooong speech back about how that's not it and she's on the streets with her kids and her husband kicked her out and yadda yadda. Unfortunately I've heard this 7 other times in my life and fell for it each time. It all ended the same way for each other person.... $ for drugs. I dont have her phone # or address . Only her Facebook messenger. My question is, is there an agency or hot line that I can use to get her help with only that info? I cant see her FB friends so I dont know who to contact because it's been so long."
352,1,"So four months ago I used for the last time (hopefully), this is not my first time in recovery however it is my first time taking suggestions and doing the work. I live in a recovery home sober living house whatever you want to call it. This place is different than the other ones in the area we are set up to help people not only stay clean but really use it as a stepping stone in life. Now with that we have a lot of freedom curfews are loose going out of town is ok but we have an absolutely zero tolerance policy on use it keeps us safe. So the last couple months I've watched this place getting taken advantage of one guy is here literally a couple hours a week another is on felony bond he took a vacation across the country secretly and now sneaks nasty women in early recovery in almost every night and the third guy out of the six of us literally nods out everyday. He claims he's not on mats but will literally pass out in the 15 degree garage for an hour then come in and cook at midnight stay up till 5 nodding out the whole time and then go pbt  (drug court) and then be gone all day... and repeat. So I guess my question is what do I do I've brought all this stuff up and nothing's been done I know it shouldn't bother me but I'm sick of hearing moaning at 4 am and finding dude nodded out in the garage I can't even relax in my own home anymore... help"
353,1,"Hi there. I'm 1 year sober. I am trying out this whole dating game in sobriety.  I seem to be struggling a little bit as far as setting boundaries.  I attend meetings 5 days a week.

How would you say I should handle healthy boundaries in dating?"
359,1,"Just celebrated four years sober and so happy/proud/grateful!!   Spent many years addicted to heroin and a used all kinds of other drugs. Now I‚Äôm blessed with a beautiful wife, incredible career, and three amazing daughters. I‚Äôve even recently gotten full custody of my 12 year old daughter and we have such a good relationship."
361,1,"I was very clear about not dating early on and did not pursue a relationship bc I wanted to focus on myself. Now I feel like it‚Äôs time to get out there, but I‚Äôm tired and wary and scared. Mostly SCARED. I also don‚Äôt want all my hard work to get messed up just, just for a guy. I have made that mistake before. 

I am happy, but lonely."
362,1,"I spent my first 9 days in jail and 4 of those days spent experiencing intense detox.  Jail has to be the absolute worst place to detox from heroin.  I was able to survive that hell and I am never going back.  I have relapsed 4 times in my life and there will not be a 5th.  I found out today that while I was in jail my girlfriend was staying with our dealer trading sex for drugs.  Turns out she has been doing this whenever she wanted more drugs than I was able to provide.  Way I see it, I am much better off without her in my life.  Shes far from the woman I fell in love with 2 years ago.  Anyways heres to 2 weeks off dope and I'm looking forward to all the money I'm going to save.  I'm working toward getting a Nintendo Switch...lost my first one to the pawn shop last year and I miss it."
363,1,"I have been clean for almost a year. My drugs of choice were weed and ambien. I also quit drinking, even though that wasn‚Äôt my primary substance and didn‚Äôt really have a major problem w drinking. Alcohol was pretty easy to give up. I want to be of all mind and mood altering substances altogether.

ANYWAY. I have trouble sleeping and have been so accustomed to ‚Äútaking something‚Äù at bedtime to sleep. For a while, I was taking nothing but melatonin (and some nights, not even that) but then I started taking over the counter sleep aids again. They‚Äôre the sleeping pills you get from CVS (diphenhydramine, which is Benadryl).

My concern is not the amount; when I take it for the night, it‚Äôs just 1 standard dose. My concern is the frequency. It‚Äôs every night, without fail. And I tell myself I will stop when I run out, but when I run out I worry about getting into bed and waking up the next morning, so I run and get more from the store, ‚Äújust this one last time‚Äù

This mentality is what sparked and fueled my addiction and kept it going. I feel that Benadryl has become my loophole because I love downers and this knocks me out at night. In fact, I have struggled with insomnia all my life and Benadryl was the first substance I ever took regularly, as a teenager.

I know Benadryl isn‚Äôt life threatening like other things (who knows? I‚Äôm sure there are consequences to taking it every single day and having it in your system in some form all the time). 

I feel like I am playing with fire here. 

Am I overreacting? Does this make any sense?"
364,1,"It‚Äôs interesting seeing this situation on the other side, in recovery. When it was me, I thought I had it under control. I didn‚Äôt. 

This guy is ‚Äúout sick‚Äù more than anyone else; the only other person I know who was ‚Äúout sick‚Äù that much was ME when I was in my addiction. 

He leaves work midday/early a lot bc says he isn‚Äôt feeling well, he works from home all the time... he comes into the office like once a week. 

I‚Äôm just saying, I know the signs. I think he‚Äôs a ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù alcoholic or drug addict who hasn‚Äôt hit bottom yet. I could be wrong, but I get the sense from his absence and behavior that it‚Äôs substance abuse. It‚Äôs either that or he has a SERIOUS medical condition like cancer or something."
368,1,"[the picture](http://imgur.com/a/0YYYrFx)

Some from my Dad, like the spot he'd choke and the collar bone he broke. Some from myself, a moron who thought it'd be the best way to get someone's attention to take us away from that house. Some from the older-than-me kid who said it was just a game, that he just wanted to try what he saw in the grown up magazines. Honestly? The ones that hurt the most weren't the ones that left marks. If you're in a bad situation, don't make subtle whispers of help. Roar for it. Demand it from the world. Don't suffer in silence because you're scared. Believe it or not, whoever's hurting you can't control you forever. Get out of their grasp, for your loved one's sake and most importantly yours. I'm proof you can get away, just get away sooner than I did. You deserve better, so go get better. I believe in you."
370,1,"What are the main differences between the two?

I'm an alcoholic and an addict, but I basically stopped drinking when I turned to heroin.  Then,  I went on medication assisted therapy (suboxone) for 4.5 years and got off that 6 months ago. Been fully substance free since then, but never worked a program due to the stigma around Suboxone. 

I've struggled mentally these last 6 months (basically dry drunk), so I've been going to AA meetings for a few weeks. I realized I chose AA because I know some people who preferred it over NA, but I didnt properly do my research for myself. I've only been to a handful of NA meetings ever, and not since years ago. 

I'd like to get a sponsor and work the steps, but wondering if I should keep shopping programs or if it even matters which I go with? I do like AA, but I didnt even realize I was an alcoholic until I battled heroin and by that point it had been a couple years since my last drink (I havent drank in  6 or 7 years). I am thinking maybe I can be more open about my drug use if I go to NA, or find someone I relate to more, but how different is the culture and the program?"

Calmness, peace, and happinesss, no doubt a true godsend

‚ÄúAnxiety‚Äôs my middle name,‚Äù I thought,  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who I am‚Äù  
Life has been so hard for me  
And this shit is my jam

She said she‚Äôd never leave me  
But she wanted me to die  
I had a life my future bright  
My head stuck in the sky

Her blanket sewn by satan‚Äôs hands  
Stayed draped around me tight  
She held me close and whispered soft  
(Stay here you‚Äôll be alright)

She tastes so good I couldn‚Äôt stop  
It‚Äôs one it‚Äôs two it‚Äôs three  
False confidence and slurring words  
Why can‚Äôt she leave me be?

She took my pep she took my step  
Is this what they call death?  
I‚Äôll have you know there was a time  
She even took my breath

I ran to him and told him  
Thinking he won‚Äôt understand  
Had I hurt him worse than she hurt me?  
That was not at all my plan

He‚Äôs crying in his room alone  
It‚Äôs taken an extreme  
The man I loved so deeply  
Was it nothing but a dream?

I wish he knew the pain I felt  
When looking in his eyes  
See that‚Äôs the thing that stupid bitch  
She taught me how to lie

But what went wrong? I asked myself  
How did I get so lost?  
I never loved myself at all  
So now I pay the cost

That precious little brown haired girl  
Her big eyes filled with tears  
What‚Äôs wrong with me? She thought all day  
So different from her peers

Why do I care, why do I feel  
This bullshits way too much  
They‚Äôre mean to me, I‚Äôm way too fat  
I couldn't eat my lunch

My tears turned into anger  
And my anger soon to rage  
I‚Äôm done with xans I swear I am  
It‚Äôs time to turn the page

Since then I‚Äôve told them everything  
Thank God for honesty  
Her knife‚Äôs no longer in my back  
(She left me there to bleed)

But hear me out, I lost control  
I didn‚Äôt have a choice  
She said she‚Äôd be my closest friend  
Then robbed me of my voice

I kicked her to the curb  
And while her damage is still done  
I‚Äôm stronger with out her, you see  
I know she‚Äôs not the one"

377,1,On May 12th I'll be clean from cutting for a year. I'm so proud of myself because the reason I was cutting was because of an abusive partner. I haven't been entirely perfect though as I used to scratch at my skin to cause pain after may because I needed something. Within the same span of time from then to know I attempted the take my own life because I thought I would never be able to get better. I was at a horrible time in my life that I never thought would end but since leaving my partner I've been happier and free from the thoughts of cutting.

While the ""withdrawals"" aren't physical, they certainly there mentally. My body dysmorphia is so prominent, the bloating, the regular eating, the intrusive thoughts it's all so much.

389,1,"I have had a super unhealthy relationship with all 3 of these subjects. Girls recently in my life, weed for the past 4 years, and nicotine in the past 3 years. I haven‚Äôt smoked weed in 2 ish weeks, (before I didn‚Äôt for 3 but then I did over winter break because that‚Äôs all my friends and I did together), nicotine in 3-4 days, and I just have an addictive, dependent, escapism personality and all of these have become my reality of what I like to do.

I had friends and I feel like they‚Äôre all leaving me.

I also didn‚Äôt exercise much (which I should... not just for weight but also for overall physical health and mental health more than anything). Fast forward to now, I had to buy new clothes because nothing fit, and looking at old pics of myself is bittersweet. 

It‚Äôs not like I blew up or anything, but I definitely notice the change. I‚Äôm grateful for my recovery and let myself indulge in food this first year while I figure this out, but I think now it‚Äôs time to allow my body to bounce back.

392,1,"I have been struggling with depression for a few months now. It has its peaks, one happening recently, and its lows. But in its peaks it gets really bad where I can barely function and genuinely dont want to live. I have managed to keep it a secret and no one knows. I never told anyone for a few reasons, 1 being that I'm a teenager and I feel like a lot of teenagers fake depression for attention, and didnt want anyone to think that of me. Another reason is that I didnt know why I was deppresed. There were no sad events in my life, a lot of people love me, and I have everything I could want. But the main reason is the fact I didnt want my parents to think it was they're fault. They love me a lot and they are why I haven't killed myself yet.
However recently I found out that depression runs in the family. I think with this factor it would help my parents think it's not their fault. Also this explains why I cant think of any reasons on why this is happening.
I think I'm gonna tell my parents, does anyone have suggestions on how I should do it? I think they are suspicious about it already but I dont know how to confront them about it."

395,1,So first I want to say I have been clean for a year off H and fentanyl. I struggled on and off for 21 years with opiates. I met my first husband in a NA meeting and this marriage was a total disaster. Of course we wound up using together. So I thought that two addicts were terrible together. 3 years later I met my current husband and we are both in recovery. This marriage is full of life and love and he‚Äôs my best friend. So I think it could go both ways. I think some work and some don‚Äôt depending on if you and he are really ready to stay clean.
396,1,"Seriously, I don‚Äôt know why people scavenge for a partner right out the gate. It‚Äôs a recipe for relapse and worse. 

If you were already in a relationship, that‚Äôs different. 

However, if you have a shit ton of work to do on yourself, news flash: looking for someone (to ‚Äúhave a good time, a distraction, a companion‚Äù whatever excuse you wanna call it) is the last thing you need because it will take the focus off your recovery, become a new drug, and fuck up your path. It doesn‚Äôt work. It works out maybe... 1% of the time? You‚Äôre willing to take that risk when there‚Äôs so much on the line?

I see so many people screw up everything over a relationship and lose whatever they worked for. Don‚Äôt do it. 

It can fucking wait."

I have a new friend (an acquaintance, really; we aren‚Äôt close at all) who is newly in recovery and doing a LOT of the right things, but is also making a lot of unwise, BAD calls and doing things that will surely derail his path. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before before he relapses. I can voice my concerns and offer suggestions, and that is really all I can do, especially if he doesn‚Äôt listen. Maybe he just needs to learn the hard way. 

But seriously; it‚Äôs a matter of time. I hope he doesn‚Äôt die."

399,1,"I‚Äôve been in and out of the program for several years. My longest stint of sobriety was 2.5 years. I‚Äôm currently 4 months sober (the most sobriety I‚Äôve had in 7 years), and things are slowly getting better. I‚Äôm in the middle of my divorce and my ex isn‚Äôt the nicest. We‚Äôve only been married for 2 years. He‚Äôs a normie and views my addiction as being 100% selfish. We have two children together, an 8 month old and a 2 year old. Thankfully, I am completely over this tumultuous relationship.
Anyways, dating in sobriety has never been a pleasant experience for me. But, I don‚Äôt want to end up alone (I know I‚Äôm only 35). I want to meet someone who is put together, will love my children and likes dogs. Why do I feel like this person is going to be impossible to find? Why is dating in recovery so scary? Anyhow, I just wanted to throw this out in the universe, because I have nothing to lose by doing so!"
401,1,"So I'm fully recovered after five infernal years of anorexia and bulimia and I'm so happy about this. I'm no longer subjugate of those evil treats, I see myself happy in the future with an healthy body no longer starving myself. So why am I struggling? Those years I didn't really progress at university, I was fully concentrated on my problems and I didn't really care about my grades, or at least I haven't had the strenght to study.. Now I'm at the last year, far from my friends and my bf. When I think about this I find what I have done so stupid. How can I forgive myself?"
402,1,"I have been lurking on here for years now. Always trying to figure out what the best way to put myself through detox on my own bc I didn‚Äôt have the means to go away. After doing some research and talking to MANY many people I finally decided to stop my 4 year long Addiction to heroin and almost 10 years of Xanax. I kept trying to quit and I would reach maybe 4-5 days and quickly run back to H so I could feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Then I came across the Loperamide and someone I met through here who was a complete angel!! She helped me devise a plan of dosing with lope after my last H fix and then a subutex taper. I can‚Äôt thank everyone ENOUGH for all the information and for how helpful everyone has been to me. I‚Äôm proud to say that today is day 16 with no H or Xanax!!!!! I NEVER IN MY LIFE thought I would be saying this especially about the Xanax. I thought I would never stop taking it. My anxiety is INSANE and I can‚Äôt sleep very much, but, I‚Äôm okay and sober! I just want whoever is reading this &amp; still struggling to quit opiates bc of being nervous about withdrawals, that there IS an end! If I was able to do this... YOU can! I literally am the biggest bitch when any sort of WD would start and I would quickly run back to H but with the Loperamide it was almost pain free. I am forever grateful and I know this will be a long journey for me but just for today, I am not using and that‚Äôs all that matters to me right now. God-bless everyone! Thanks for listening to me.. I never made an actual post before! ü§ó"

404,1,"Hi,

I‚Äôve hit rock bottom. After 4 years sober from a life long of basically any substance high available I relapsed with weed stimulants alcohol and video games. I honestly cant remember why I got back in it but maybe it was the stress of becoming a father (and the fact I‚Äôm an addict?). Anyway, this time it has cost me a $60k/yr job and six months of my life doing anything relatively productive. At this point I‚Äôm only a few days ‚Äúclean‚Äù, I‚Äôm primarily motivated by the need to get a job and support my family, but I know I have a lifelong battle to stay sober. I have a wonderful wife and three little kids. Please pray if you do that for me and thanks for having this community to see that I‚Äôm not alone in my struggle. Resist the devil and he shall flee. Wishing all the best and victory over themselves."
405,1,"So I‚Äôm one of the lucky to suffer a schizo-breed of disorder...but it‚Äôs not much of a suffer these days. I‚Äôm also one of the fortunate to come out of the grip of addiction with all 10 digits and no teeth (problems).

There‚Äôs a fine line between a schiz‚Äôd out perception and a meth-induced psychosis I‚Äôve been walking for a little over 4 years now. Backing it up 7 years; I hit my first depressive low. 

Now I‚Äôd always had a bit of a depression, but nothing that I couldn‚Äôt shake off or distract myself from. But this one put me in bed for 18-20 hours a day. Sleeping, no drugs, no motivation, and just not caring that I didn‚Äôt care anymore. I was too chicken shit to kill myself, not confident enough to engage in the world, and had just enough food stamps to keep me in a hyperglycemic coma. After 3 or 4 weeks, my mom had me admitted to get my mental health checked out and that began my psychotropic shuffle. Antidepressants in waves and combos that worked, then didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not gonna list them all off but I had tried the full gambit of them with the exception of Prozac over the course of 2 1/2 years.

I was in an intensive outpatient program and over the 18 months in that, my clinician had observed me through the course of med changes, relapses on narcotics, losses, gains; all of it. The last time we spoke, she had me admitted back into the psyche-ward‚Äôesk place I‚Äôd go for detox and mental stabilization with the idea of Bipolar being my actual  diagnosis. I went in, and Prozac being the last med to try for my depression, so it was.

The first day, I felt really happy. Like uncomfortably happy. The unicorns were sneezing glitter and shitting cupcakes, and all was better than it could be. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night out of utter excitement of how great everything was. The next day (sunrise indicates a new day for me) I was still in that pink cloud of glory, but it was even more uncomfortable. I told the staff that something wasn‚Äôt right...that it‚Äôs wrong just how happy I felt. They laughed and brought me to another staff member to tell them my experience. Everybody got a chuckle because this depressed kid was happy for the first time. I insisted something‚Äôs wrong and they told me ‚ÄúHappiness is like an island...you‚Äôve been in this sea of unworthiness and loneliness so long and suddenly you‚Äôre on an island...‚Äù or something to that affect.

That made me feel okay with the discomfort of happiness. The 4th day, they sent me home without having slept. Now when I got home, the house was the same; my bed with the sweat stains from my depressed slumber, the Reese‚Äôs Cream Pie in the fridge I was self-destructing with, so I made the best out of my day. Went to a 12 step meeting, and told them I felt more fucked up than when I checked in the first day. People in the rooms were against medication, so I got no empathy or sympathy, or direction. 

I was awake for 6 or 7 days. No drugs but the prescribed Prozac...that pink cloud with the unicorns shitting cupcakes turned a deep red, and the unicorns were shooting laser beams from their eyes, creating mushroom clouds out of my emotions. I couldn‚Äôt communicate to anyone at the house because I began rapid-cycling feelings and emotions. Like 4 different emotions contained and rotating with each sentence. I called the psyche place to civilly or decently ask to come back because shit wasn‚Äôt right.

Usually it‚Äôs a 24-48 hour process to get in there, but they got me back in within the hour. Got loaded up with a sleep med (antipsychotic #1) so I could at least breathe and verbalize with the psychiatrist the next morning. 

Apparently, that was a manic episode. The joy, excitement, enthusiasm, and overall happiness. But couple that with sleep deprivation, it gets dangerous. The psychiatrist started talking about a different class of meds. Lithium and that sleep one - to treat the Bipolar. I thought that was a bold step because I didn‚Äôt wanna consider myself the ‚ÄúB‚Äù word. He explained my reaction to the Prozac told him it wasn‚Äôt depression I was dealing with. He reassured me ‚ÄúLithium Is a naturally occurring element, that it‚Äôs on the periodic table of elements‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is arsenic‚Äù I replied...I thought it was funny for that argument.

I stayed there for 9 days this time, and my mom had suggested I keep an hourly check-in journal...over the course of getting me to the ‚Äútherapeutic range‚Äù of Lithium, I noticed something. Everything was neither as good nor as bad as I used to think. It wasn‚Äôt difficult, it wasn‚Äôt familiar...everything was just okay.

Now, Lithium is not for everyone, and I‚Äôve heard horror stories, but that‚Äôs not what I experienced.

I was awaiting an in-patient drug rehab while all this was going on. The facility let me stay until I checked into in-patient. I was over a month clean at check in...28 days later, I‚Äôm all rehab‚Äôd up in a new place. As the universe works the way it does, I found a doc within 12 hours of leaving and was scheduled to see a psyche regularly. I had no friends, no job, no leads, no phone...notta. But I felt like things were gonna work out.

From couch hopping, meetings, appointments, Voc Rehab, the whole slew of early recovery; I finally landed a bed in a halfway house. It was around 4 or 5 months clean from the illicit drugs, that shit got weird. Before going to bed at the halfway house one night, I was on the phone with my lady friend, and there were some people around the corner talking about us as if I wasn‚Äôt within earshot. I swear they were doing that drama gossip, so I got off the phone to go casually barge into their conversation. When people talk about me, I love to hear what they have to say. XD

I turned the corner and there wasn‚Äôt anybody there....I was totally dumbfounded. I could swear I observed 2 or 3 people in my peripheral turn the corner and do the social-smoke-circle thing. Really bugged me because that was one of those famous head trips from staying awake too many days with too many drugs and too little sustenance.

I told my psyche the following week about it, and so began the shuffle once more. I was right about 6 months clean and med-compliant when I got a bug up my ass to move back to my ‚Äústomping grounds‚Äù. I had a guaranteed bedroom, a vehicle, more opportunity, but still evading the imaginary people.

I never was one to listen to them, I just heard them. Like a voice outside of me that I can‚Äôt make out the words. When I moved, got set up with a new psyche that day, and shared my path of medication to where I was. She switched me to a new one, by tapering one and incorporating the new. Seemed legit. They recommend 4-6 weeks for the meds to really work, so I gave them that. But by the end of 4-6 weeks, I felt crazier than the med before. 

The imaginary people had evolved into ghosts, or spirits traveling through light/reflections. I really couldn‚Äôt hang - I was manic as all hell, uncomfortable, frightened, and crazy. May as well be on drugs so I can feel good, right? That was my M-O for each med. Heroin/opiates always cooled my jets and I could laugh at myself, but that always led back to the meth...where I would rinse-wash-repeat with the crazies.

I had stepped into a delusional world of seeing things happening in other places that I had no involvement with. It grew paranormal, and totally plausible in my eyes. So I stopped getting high and got onto a new medication. That trip themed my life the whole time on medications, and each trip sort of preceded the next until my delusions were painting an imaginary picture of a realm of existence that‚Äôs sort of woven within our dimension of everyday life.

Shit got nuts. Then I got high, got clean, new medication, for a couple years. I was high for maybe 3 days out of a month hoping that the new med would fix whatever was scrambled in my head. We went through all of the modern antipsychotics, and reverted to the older ones (Haldol, Thorazine, etc) because nothing was working.

*I‚Äôm clean today, and know that combining drugs/medications is impractical, but this was my path that is leading me to the punch of this story*

One med that seemed to work, also helped me put on 25 lbs in 2 weeks. At that point, I ceased all medications and went straight to street drugs to drop that weight. Weight gain never bugged me until I saw fresh stretch marks. Lol. Took me a month to lose that weight but my crazies had peaked an all-time high...and I had no tolerance for drugs.

Used to be a $30 hit of meth was my daily thing (in the beginning before any kind of treatment) but at the end of my use, a $5 piece would send me into a schiz‚Äôd out episode for the better part of two weeks. Paranoia, mania, delusions, hallucinations, just all that nasty stuff. Being off dope for two weeks and not getting better made it easy to consider using again; but those two weeks I was petrified to use. Couldn‚Äôt even journal my thoughts, verbalize anything...my room had blankets covering the windows, mirrors, and any reflective surface and the only light had to be analog lighting with candles.

Shit got weird.

The last time I got high sent me over the edge. My last high is another blog about this long so I‚Äôll just say it was a fucked up time. But today, I‚Äôve been med compliant for over two years and am in the process of tapering from my minimal prescription WITH support from my psyche staff. My current diagnosis is Schizoaffective Disorder...Bipolar 1 with schizophrenic traits. Been clean from all narcotics for over 21 months.

I probably didn‚Äôt need to write as much as I did, because what follows is all I wanted to share;

The island metaphor for happiness really helped me to understand what happiness looked like. To help people understand what goes on in my brain, I‚Äôve related the brain to a radio.

Life is just a radio frequency. We‚Äôll call it 98.9. Everybody picks up that station. We wear shoes, the sun is warm and bright, buildings and chairs - just Life. Everyone‚Äôs brain picks up 98.9. My brain (with or without drugs) can sometimes pick up other stations. Like 56.2 - the people watching through reflections, when my dresser drawer closes it opens in another dimension. Some days 14.8 comes in and I‚Äôm the target of everybody‚Äôs judgement and am on the clock to be removed from our world (not by death, just removed). These stations are subtle, but they come in if I‚Äôm really listening. Even worse, is when they‚Äôre all coming in simultaneously, and I‚Äôm getting a fuzzy mixed signal, and can‚Äôt decipher what station I‚Äôm supposed to be listening to...to make it EVEN worse is when people think they‚Äôre helping by using reason within their own station. 

Psyche meds helped me to tune my radio. They certainly helped open up other channels, but from being tuned effectively for a time, when other stations come up, I can tell it‚Äôs a different station. However wrong or right it may be, I‚Äôm able to wiggle the antenna to pick up the right perception. 

Thanks for the read."

‚ÄúWhen finally my household went quite broke, I woke up to the fact that I hadn't been able to face the prospect of going back to work. So I returned to Wall Street after all. And I have ever since been glad that I did ... Indeed, there was one colossal dividend that resulted directly from my grudging decision to reenter the market place. It was a Wall Street business trip to Akron, Ohio, in 1935, that first brought me face to face with Dr. Bob -- AA's co-founder-to-be. So the birth of AA itself actually hinged on the fact that I had been trying to meet my bread-and-butter responsibilities.‚Äù

419,1,"I love an ADDICT

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures &amp; reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

420,1,"1 week after abusing alcohol 4 days in a row, I'm still trying to recover from the affects. 
I feel like a fucking vegetable and have almost forgotten how to speak to people.
My mind is trying to play tricks on me but I know it's just hallucinations.  If this is permanent or not, I'm praying to God every day for help. I'm grateful for everything he has given me and repenting with all my soul. 
I'm never giving up, and I'm never fucking drinking again. Before it gets better I have to deal with the consequences. I'm on 2mg valium and once I taper off, I'll get my life on fucking track.
There's no way I'm going to throw my life away with all the blessings I have. I fucked over my family for drugs and it has almost completely killed me mentally.

I can‚Äôt come to terms with things that have happened in my life and after years of never allowing myself to have a pity party or feel bad for myself I just need to now. I can‚Äôt come to terms with that I was an exceptionally smart, beautiful, outgoing young girl with lots of friends, ambitions and goal driven and now all those things are gone. I can‚Äôt come to terms with that I never wanted to be an addict, I never signed up for it or sought out drugs. They were prescribed to me with my mom sitting next to me at the end of 2013. I can‚Äôt come to terms with everything that happened through till I got sober in 2017. I lost everything in that time and because I was so young I honest to god didn‚Äôt know what was happening.

I can‚Äôt handle looking in the mirror and seeing a sunken shallow ugly face despite being sober for years, there is no ‚Äúbefore and after!‚Äù Where one day I lit up again. I‚Äôm the definition of ‚Äúpeaked in high school‚Äù in every sense of the word.

I wake up praying I‚Äôm fixed and I never am. I‚Äôm in therapy multiple times a week, I exercise, I have a partner, I have a child, I eat extremely healthy, but I am a ruined person. I ruined myself.

427,1,"I‚Äôm a recovering addict, I‚Äôm 20, and here‚Äôs a short version of my story because I would really like to get it off my chest tonight.

In my early teenage years I romanticized drug use to myself and among the one or two friends I had throughout high school. After dropping out so I could work bc my caregiver was a disabled addict himself, I began to take things farther than before.

My daily marijuana use began to include cocaine and alcohol abuse, added psychedelics, prescription benzos and painkillers, otc medications, anything at all that could warp my perception of reality in a new, exciting way.
I was ignorant to think I wouldn‚Äôt continue pushing myself up to my breaking point, or until I was institutionalized, arrested, or dead.

In the past two years, I was introduced to my DOC, meth. Originally, I used it the way I‚Äôd used cocaine many many times before, but in less than a month I was smoking it every day. I was hiding from my friends and roommates, I was staying out all night to get high in my car alone, I was sneaking away and leaving my phone at home so the people that cared about me couldn‚Äôt see that my current location was the dope dealers house.

I was arrested. But not before doing horrible damage to my body. Losing significant weight from not eating days at a time, picking my skin so it wouldn‚Äôt heal for weeks, smoking ice and cigarettes back to back for months which led to tooth and gum disease at 20 years old. I resorted to crack cocaine to tide me over till my next bag of my DOC. When I think about the damage I did to myself in those short months, and the little satisfaction I got from it, my heart breaks. I‚Äôm not the same person. My brain does not work the same, my emotions hardly feel like my own anymore, and even 4 months clean my sleep patterns can be erratic and a huge stressor for me. 

I romanticized the things I was doing. I remember feeling on top of the world, I remember feeling free and crying tears, I thought they were happiness. I thought it was an intense almost erotic release which I chased and chased for so long. To accept it is gone and that it was never ever something that made me happy is heartbreaking and very confusing for me. 

I feel very alone. I‚Äôm lucky to be 4 months clean from this drug, and be testing clean for everything else as of this week, but I‚Äôm struggling."
431,1,I am coming up on 5 years clean and I live life so fully. I‚Äôm thankful for every day good and bad. Ultimately I‚Äôm so thankful I experienced addiction homelessness all of it because today in my own home with all my babies pursuing my lifelong dream it makes it all so worth it. I feel so content even though we have very little compared to most. Despite being financially strapped I feel wealthy. I learned so much from those years about myself. If you have made it out the other side then I consider us the lucky ones!
432,1,"My boyfriend and I are both in recovery. He was an opioid user and I was a stimulant user. A little over a month ago I knew he was using, and it was Xanax, he had 20 months clean up until this use. He denied it until I found the pills and confronted him about it head on. The past few days he‚Äôs been having mood swings and he‚Äôs been going through ups and downs of nodding out and being alert. I haven‚Äôt found any drugs this time despite my searching. He fell asleep at 3pm yesterday and was just aggressively sweating and slept and sweated until 7am today. When he woke up this morning the first thing he did was go to the bathroom and start heaving. He denies that he‚Äôs using, but it‚Äôs obvious. I‚Äôm going to love him through anything and I‚Äôll help him in any way I can. I‚Äôm just at a loss because if I ask him if he used he gets mad about it, but I just don‚Äôt know how to get him to understand that I‚Äôm not mad at him no matter what, I want to assist him. 

If anyone has ever been through helping a loved one who has relapsed, I could really use some experience, strength, and hope. It‚Äôs crushing me inside. I just wish the earth would open up and swallow me. I want to lay in bed and cry and hide until the storm passes."

434,1,"So I was on audible looking for a good book to listen to next and a new title just published called

 ‚ÄúQuit Like A Woman: The Radical choice to Not Drink in a Culture Obsessed With Alcohol‚Äù by- Holly Whitaker 

 As I was reading it I was like idk about this. She sounds like  a valley girl and she‚Äôs mentioning a bunch of hipster trends like juicing and crystal yatta yatta.

This book turned me into a pile of mush, and I wasn‚Äôt crying sad tears at the end, maybe in the middle, but they were tears of validation of how fucked this culture is, and that we in recovery get the blessing of seeing that and not normalize the drinking of poison. 
She validated how culture is quick to blame us the individual as the problem and not the substance, but bring in a heavier drug and it‚Äôs the drug that‚Äôs the problem.
‚ÄúDrink responsibly‚Äù because it‚Äôs your problem if you can‚Äôt handle this addictive substance that we‚Äôve all normalized as a pathway to adulthood.

It hit me hard because just like her my family has a history of alcohol abuse on both sides. I was confused for a long time because my parents are for the most part sober, and just like this book explains... it‚Äôs only the first step to a healing journey we didn‚Äôt realize would happen next.

Giving it up, whatever the substance is, is the first step to a journey that not all get to go on or choose. For us we‚Äôre kinda forced to, but this journey is to finally meet the person on the other side. The one we were always meant to be before this culture said ‚Äúthis is how you have fun, and if you work hard you play harder‚Äù. Fuck that.

These are just a few things in the book along with a feminist attitude about the culture and about us. And remembering who we are, and that whatever keeps us sober, even outside of the 12 steps is worth it because all our journeys won‚Äôt be the same. That we all are on different paths to the same destination of self love and compassion for the person who was told way too many ‚Äúshoulds‚Äù from all around.

This isn‚Äôt a book to tell you what to do, but what the author has gone through and her perspectives on getting sober and the changing world perspective she gets through her research on addiction, alcohol, and culture around her. 

And so many awesome quotes to inspire you along the way.

As you can see I started out ... why did I buy this... I‚Äôm not an alcoholic per say . I can put it down.... but ended up nodding my head, and filled with tears saying ‚Äúyes, enough is enough‚Äù I‚Äôve been sober with occasional drinks saying I can handle it. Yet when I do I find myself wishing I stayed sober.

I will not look at alcohol the same way, and it really helps remind me I don‚Äôt want alcohol or altering substance in my life. I don‚Äôt want people who revolve around alcohol or substances either. I want me and I want to be radical and passionate about life, and meditate and chase my passions and it‚Äôs hard work, but it‚Äôs worth it. No more quick fixes, because long term goals are more rewarding even when it doesn‚Äôt feel like it in the moment.

We‚Äôve been through enough and we deserve to spread love through ourselves not like the people pleasers we were. 

So check it if you want, and that‚Äôs my review and some of the things I felt I got out of it. It‚Äôs a modern book on how sobriety is in fashion and self care and compassion is the trend we will start by educating society that we got a lot wrong and that‚Äôs okay because we will fix it by healing ourselves and spreading self love."

I've been on methadone 4.5 years, benzos over 4.5 years, pregabalin a year and a half, diphenhydramine a year and olanzapine half a year. I've gotten off cannabis in the last year and gotten my pregabalin down from 600mg/day down to ~10mg or less of pregabalin. I've been on and off the diphenhydramine and olanzapine for sleep as my bed and couch are infested with mice. I almost got off the benzos during the summer but I relapsed. I'm so sick of this cycle.

I'm going to try not to take any diphenhydramine this weekend. I have exams in 3 months and I'm sick of having such a foggy head. I'm not going to get any or much sleep this weekend.

I'm so tired of living like this, guys. I wish there was a switch I could flick and not be physically dependent on anything. I could do recovery from there. But this trying to get off stuff all the time is just endless misery."

441,1,"I love this man to death but no matter what I say he refuses to get help. I want him to know I love him and I want to be with him but it‚Äôs taking such a role that I can‚Äôt be with him unless he walks away from drugs for good. Everyone tells me that he needs to figure it out on his own and me helping him is enabling. Maybe if I understand the perspective of someone who‚Äôs been through what he is I can know how to approach him the best way.

What was the most impactful thing that made you realize you love yourself enough to walk away from substances forever."
442,1,"I have low weight anorexia and started new therapy yesterday. What a wake up call. I knew it was bad, but I didn‚Äôt realize HOW bad. My therapist point blank told me we won‚Äôt make long term plans because I might die. Hoping this is partially a scare tactic, but damn it scared me. I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night and I‚Äôm on the verge of tears constantly because I don‚Äôt want to die. I‚Äôve already implemented changes within the last 24 hours but I can‚Äôt shake the fear and anxiety of this. I just had to vent to someone other than my loving partner who has been with me throughout a lot of this shit. This has definitely changed my perspective on life. I feel grateful to have woken up this morning and I thanked God for another new day. Really hoping this will be the true beginning to a true end."
443,1,"I amd 8 months and some change clean n sober off heavy drugs, the heaviest for sure. Im on head meds and recently quit smoking, im in those two groups also. Why is it all i can think about is using. Not the getting high part but using to quiet the mind. Amphetamines, more clearly, Methamphetamine is my DOC but its because i could just think and do and actually be still as funny as that sounds. I think about getting it and doing so i can quiet it"
444,1,"I am 28 and my fianc√© is 30. We have been together for about 4.5 years, got engaged after 2 and still engaged. We always had issues with communication (no surprise), and I always knew it wasn‚Äôt one sided. He has been one to shut down, and I have been one to want to fix. He doesn‚Äôt know how to respond sometimes when I bring up an issue I see in our relationship, and that would fuel my idea of him not caring. We also ran into a few issues that resulted in me losing some trust in him, but no cheating. After long fights and repeated arguments over much of the same things, I realized I only have control over myself. So I got a life coach about a year ago. I knew I needed to work on myself, I knew I couldn‚Äôt change him, and I understood I needed help dealing with some issues I had internally. I knew in order for me to be of any true help to our relationship, I needed to look at myself and learned to be happy with me. I also at the time was an active alcoholic. A month after getting my life coach, I started attending AA. My fianc√© knew I had a drinking problem (no secret), and it caused some waves in our relationship, but it wasn‚Äôt the root cause of any issues. It just fueled the fire. I am now a year sober! About 6 months into my sobriety, I noticed big changes in myself from doing work through my life coach and through AA with a sponsor. I was seeing lots of progress and was happier. The fights me and my fianc√© had were no longer a screaming match, and I started taking steps back and reflecting on myself in most instances instead of blaming him for it all. I wasn‚Äôt (still not) perfect, but I was making progress. He on the other hand was still where he had always been....quiet. Unfortunately, around that 6 month point, one day my fianc√© and I were laying in bed watching something on his phone, and a text from his dad popped up. I couldn‚Äôt help but see it was about a tracking number for a package being sent to my fianc√© from him. I asked my fianc√© what that was, and he fumbled on what to say. After an hour, I finally got it out of him. His dad had been illegally sending him a mild opioid to help my fianc√© avoid his opioid withdrawals from when he was using heavily in the past. I knew he had a history, but didn‚Äôt know he was still using. I was totally blindsided. Here I was 6 months into my recovery and all this time he was using right in front of me every day, AND his own father was enabling it. The level of betrayal and hurt is something I never felt. I was in so much pain that I immediately called off the wedding (we were supposed to get married last Oct). Long story short, he went off to rehab for 30 days, has been off work since last July (his job is requiring him to work a recovery program through the industry he is in so he needs to do that before he can be cleared medically), and he is actively working a narcotics anonymous program with a sponsor. By Gods grace, I maintained my sobriety through this whole experience, and have been trying to empathize because I understand what addiction is. I understand why he lied to me all these years. I understand that this is what addicts do. Overall, I‚Äôd say I have seen improvements in how he handles himself, and he is trying really hard to open up to me while working his program. However, (especially as I reread what I just typed out) I can‚Äôt stand the thought that I feel like he has been playing catch up since the beginning. I pulled myself out of my shit and got help. I knew I needed help, while in the mean time, he thought he was doing good enough. I know this is a resentment and I am really working to move past it, but I just feel like I have been dumping so much into this relationship. I am trying to be as supportive as I can, and I know he needs to focus on his recovery, but I just feel like I am the one who sees the flaws in our relationship still and he doesn‚Äôt have the head space to give too much into it due to what he is going through. I get he is stressed because he can‚Äôt work, that he has to pay all this money for his recovery, bills, etc. But I just feel like I need more right now because I‚Äôm in a better place. I love him because he is a good man. He is flawed, but he has always been supportive and loving. At the end of the day, I know he loves me and wants to do all he can with what he has to improve himself and our relationship. I almost feel guilty saying that isn‚Äôt enough. Maybe it‚Äôs too late for him to make anything up? Maybe I‚Äôm just burnt out? I don‚Äôt know, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking for some responses from random ppl. Anything is appreciated. Thank you!"

448,1,"Hi my baby boy I am missing you so.
I‚Äôm sorry for the past I‚Äôve missed watching you grow.
Everyday there is something new that you learn and you see,
I regret more of that has not come from me.
It‚Äôs my greatest failure that I feel today, That we‚Äôve had so little time to laugh and to play.
But, still, you are loved and you are cherished and you are doted upon,
And for that I‚Äôm so grateful my beautiful son.
What I‚Äôm doing now is making a fresh start,
Trying to mend my mind and my broken heart.
So I can teach you my knowledge and protect you from harm,
So I can be in your life, to hold you in my arms.
There‚Äôs a prayer that I say many times everyday,
It helps me understand how life had gotten this way.
God, grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
This first line is to acknowledge the limits of my range.
The second line gives me strength to build as a new man,
Grant me the courage to change what I can.
The third and last line is the most powerful to me,
It has opened my eyes to what I could not see,
It helps me understand my whole life experience,
Grant me the wisdom to know the difference.
My hope is to teach you this prayer in a way,
To aid you in life‚Äôs choices you‚Äôll make everyday.
It‚Äôs just one of the many gifts I hope to pass onto you,
To use in good times and the bad ones too.
Brennan, you‚Äôre as bright as the sun,
A joy to everyone,
Your laugh is infectious,
With a smile that‚Äôs so precious.
What I‚Äôm doing now is to better my soul,
For the path I was on had certainly taken its toll.
And now I‚Äôm finding a solution,
But it‚Äôs just for today,
And it starts when I wake up and I begin to pray.
It‚Äôs a beautiful thing this serenity and peace,
Like a banquet for happiness,
It‚Äôs truly a feast.
So in ending these words from my heart so true,
I am doing this for me now, Brennan.

Because, I love you..."

451,1,"I came to Florida from Chicago in the beginning of September this year for treatment, went through detox, residential, php &amp; now i‚Äôm in iop living in a halfway house.

But my time at this iop is coming to end within the next month &amp; i‚Äôm terrified of making any choices about what to do next. 

I‚Äôm super home sick, I miss my family &amp; friends but a huge part of me fears/believes that if i go back home, it‚Äôll only be a matter of time before I relapse (i‚Äôve been to 20+ residential treatments &amp; have always gone home right after &amp; relapsed instantly). But I‚Äôm scared of staying in Florida because I don‚Äôt have many friends because I still really struggle with connecting with people &amp; I‚Äôm super socially awkward &amp; come across distant/rude and I know lonliness/isolation is a huge trigger for me. Plus if I relapse in Florida &amp; shit really hits the fan, all my support is 1400 miles away.  I‚Äôm just so afraid of making the wrong choice.

454,1,"Hi, I‚Äôm a current 2nd year occupational therapy student who has a clinical rotation in an inpatient psychiatric unit. I‚Äôm doing a little research on what have been good interventions in that setting, but I am also interested to hear personal experiences from other settings as well. 

In case you‚Äôre unfamiliar with OT, we focus on activities of daily living that are meaningful to an individual and use those activities in a therapeutic way. Some examples of this can be cooking, helping an individual use the toilet/bathe as independently as possible after an illness/injury, and recommending/teaching the use of adaptive equipment.

From the mental health side, we mostly run groups. The topics range from coping skills to mindfulness to preparatory activities that make reintegration back into society if that is something an individual is struggling with (for example, homeless or recovering addicts).

Is there any specific activity or group that made an impact on you or you feel benefitted you in any way? I want to be the best I can be for my future patients and appreciate any feedback you can give me. Thank you!"

456,1,"I posted in here a while ago about going into a treatment center to finally try to get true sobriety without any crutches. I quit heroin years ago but I‚Äôve been addicted to Kratom, gabapentin/lyrica, phenibut and also been drinking and doing psychedelics. The only benefit of using these substances over my previous drug of choice is that they won‚Äôt make me overdose and die, but my mental health is worse than it was when I was homeless In Detroit and doing heroin. The year I got clean I had overdosed and almost died close to 8 times in one year. This was before everything had fentanyl in it so I‚Äôm lucky to be alive. But my mental health is so bad I‚Äôm realizing this isn‚Äôt any better. It really is a progressive disease no matter what substance you are using and I‚Äôm declining. Two years ago I was in college with a 4.0, had a great job and was happy. My mental health caused me to drop out of school. Then it got so bad I was having a hard time just showering and brushing my teeth and doing anything. I have terrible anxiety and that‚Äôs the main root of my mental health issues but the depression has been getting awful. I need help. I came to the conclusion I had to do long term treatment because 30 days is never enough for me, I get really really bad withdrawals and don‚Äôt sleep forever and I think my anxiety disorder probably makes that worse. Idk what is real withdrawal and what is psycho somatic. I obsess over not sleeping, therefore I don‚Äôt sleep. I made it into treatment and on day 3 I freaked out and left because my withdrawals were so bad. Someone wanna tell me why my gabapentin and Kratom withdrawals are worse than my heroin withdrawals because I don‚Äôt get it. I also was using benzos close to every day but not every single day so I could be experiencing hellish withdrawals off that. Basically, I know I have to go back to rehab and I have to do this but I feel like I‚Äôm walking to the electric chair. I know what hell im about to experience and getting the courage to walk back in there is going to be so difficult. I‚Äôll probably have a bed within the next day or two so I will be going back and I have no choice but to stay. My family won‚Äôt talk to me until I get back in and show them I‚Äôm staying. My family has always been very enabling and as scary as it is that I don‚Äôt have them right now my sponsor says that‚Äôs a good thing and will be a bigger push for me to get better. I have never been fully sober and I just picture the rest of my life as being riddled with anxiety and not being able to sleep and being miserable. I‚Äôve never been able to sleep without some type of sleeping pill and even those don‚Äôt work when I‚Äôm going through withdrawals. I feel like my withdrawals will never end and I have this huge terminal uniqueness thing going on. I feel like every rehab I‚Äôve been to I‚Äôve always been the worst case with withdrawals and nurses have even confirmed that. I didn‚Äôt sleep for 24 nights when coming off high dose benzos and heroin. I can‚Äôt do it again.. I seriously don‚Äôt think I can. I am hopeless. I know the big book says the more hopeless the better but I can‚Äôt imagine recovery in my life ever being possible and that breaks my heart. Did anyone go through terrible long lasting withdrawals and learn to sleep again? I have never given myself longer than a month before I got back on Kratom or lyrica or something like that. I have fibromyalgia and coming to terms with the fact that I won‚Äôt be able to take anything for the pain is scary. Just looking for more support from you guys- this sub Reddit is awesome. I need to find some hope in myself somewhere."

464,1,"Hey guys. Been a long time lurker but figured I'd post something to celebrate with you guys. So it's been a challenging journey this time around but I think I'm finally getting it down. In the past I could only really get how we go over 30 days at a time before I would relapse on something like a single hit of weed that I ended up hating the entire experience and can only focus on the fact that I basically relapsed. But I didn't want to have to admit that especially over a single hit of weed and I didn't want people to be disappointed in me and I didn't want to be disappointed in myself oh, so instead I lie about my clean time to everybody and most of all myself like it never even happened. This however would add up and take its toll on not only my self-esteem but also on my integrity over time. It was a worse when I would take a token for like 60 or 90 days Knowing damn well that I really only had 25 or 30 because I read after my 30-day Mark I had taken that one hit of weed, or that ome hit of acid or whatever it may be. And eventually it would happen again inevitably. Because if I can justify using one since we've been under the rug I can sure as hell do it again and justify it to high heaven. but at some point it would add up and the truth will be revealed to not only myself but to everybody because either I would feel like such a piece of s*** for lying to myself and everybody else or somebody would catch me in a relapse or I would just stop caring and disappear altogether. so I've never had really any length of time longer than like 36 days except for one time when I was in what you could call a rehab of sorts for Christians. But that was because I wasn't exposed to anything.

Well today I am happy to report something different this time. I would say for the first time but really for the second time I have 34 consecutive days clean, from everything including weed or legal chemicals or whatever you can think of. but anyway you can call this the first time because this is the first time that I've maintained sobriety in my recovery and REAL LIFE, on a day-to-day basis being constantly exposed to drugs because I live in a downtown area where it's concentrated with homeless people that do dope. So I'm faced with adversity every day because I constantly see people twisting a meth pipe in public or doing a shot or they offer me drugs. But so far I've overcome all of that even though the odds are always stacked against me. Something is different this time, very different and I'm not quite sure what all that consists of but I know one thing for sure. I don't want to ever continue to lie to myself most of all about my clean time or two other people ever again oh, and I know that if I pick up in use even once that's exactly what I'll end up doing because that's what I always do. And they say if you want something different you got to do something different. And that's the main thing for me, is I'm no longer content with lying to myself. That's no longer something that I'm okay with whatsoever because it's so degrading in my self-image and I hate feeling like that and I will not do it again. so it's really just easier not to pick up and use in the long run.

and what's great about all this, is that in three more days I'll have the longest consecutive and most honest amount of clean time that I've ever had since I started using almost 10 years ago. I'm about to break the ultimate record for myself and then once I break it it's a record every single day that I continue to stay clean. And I didn't do this alone! I couldn't have done this without the help of my higher power, my friends, my family, and the program of narcotics anonymous and celebrate recovery. I'm currently looking for a sponsor for myself, and I think I've got my eyes fixed on someone who I truly think has what I want I just haven't asked him yet cuz I'm weird about that kind of stuff lol but the point is that I'm trying. I definitely need to hit more meetings, as my meeting attendance is have hazard at most, most of the time. I need to be working on staff work even if I don't have a sponsor which I don't do in I could always pray more and rely more on my higher power. Recovery is a never-ending journey or you can constantly improve upon what you have, take things and leave things, build better relationships and more relationships, work your steps either for the first time or again oh, and the list goes on. You can never stop improving and recovery. and I can definitely make a lot of improvements, but the bottom line is that for the very first time in my life I actually have a very very good feeling about making it this time, taking it one day at a time of course. I'm just no longer content with what I've had in the past and I want more for myself and I know I can achieve that. I have confidence that I can finally start to stay clean for once and not have to lie to myself or other people about something stupid like a one-hit weed relapse. because that one hit weed relapse won't happen in the first place.

Even in just these past 60 days I've come quite a long way, and I definitely have quite a bit more to go before I even scratch the surface. But the main thing is is that I finally have a little bit of confidence that I can make it, because right now I am making it. I'm part of the winners crowd and I'll remain in that crowd as long as I maintain my sobriety. I don't ever want to go back to how my life was before I don't have to so long as I don't pick up that first drug. So thank you for sharing this moment with me guys and if you  read all that I commend you! share some of your guys's experiences and accomplishments with me I'd love to hear!"

‚ÄúBeaten into complete defeat by alcohol, confronted by the living proof of release, and surrounded by those who can speak to us from the heart, we have finally surrendered.

472,1,"Hi there, I am a non-addict struggling with being friends with and potentially someday dating a recovering addict, and I need some help. I am fully aware I can't understand what he's going through. I barely know him but I like him a lot, the more we talk the more I feel this strong connection I don't feel with other people, but I'm not always sure what to expect or say and if I'm in over my head. Let me explain how this started: He came into the store where I worked about a week ago and as I was cashing him out asked if I remembered him from high school. I said vaguely. He cracked a joke about being a troublemaker and said I probably wasn't ever in trouble, and I cracked a joke back about being in detention once for being late to homeroom. It was kinda cute how honest and nervous he was, and he asked if he could add me on fb. I agreed and reminded him of my name. He added me that night and since we've been talking on there. We have video chatted a few times too, which is generally pleasant but also kinda sporadic.

After talking to him for a bit I learned that he is a recovering heroin and meth addict, and has Hep C. He'd been in prison for getting caught breaking into a condemned building to get meth, and while he was there got his GED and wants to go to college. Apparently he also wants to sue his doctor for not getting him his medication because it's really important he gets it on time. He wasn't particularly up front about everything but was very willing to answer any questions I asked. I find I have to ask the right question. So I don't feel he's being intentionally secretive, I think he's telling the truth about things. But he may be leaving things out and I have no way of knowing. He has 2 little girls whom he loves very much and wants to get better for. He was sober for 14 months, but then he relapsed and was very mad at himself because when he gets out he gets custody of his daughters. This time he seems really determined and is 6 months sober.

He came into the store to see me a 2nd time which was pretty awkward on both our parts, come to find out later we're just both very anxious people. Lately I'm usually more confident but he makes me feel things I really haven't before, there's just something about him. So after that he asked me to dinner sometime. I wasn't sure what to say, but before I could decide he said that actually he couldn't because he's going to be transferred to a halfway house in a few days and won't be able to. I did some research on addiction and recovery, and saw that they recommend not to date until you've been clean a year. I know he had been before, but after relapse I imagine it starts all over. So I told him I'd like to talk to him and get to know him as friends but that I didn't think it was a good time to date and explained that I am not going to stand in the way of his progress. I told him I have anxiety and depression, and things I'm working on as well so it's not the best time for me either.

He's kind and sensitive, tells me I'm pretty almost every time we talk, and I can tell he genuinely has been trying to get to know me. He says he's comfortable talking to me and thanks me for not judging him, which of course I don't. So here's the thing. I struggle with depression and anxiety. I don't do well when someone makes plans to talk then leaves me hanging without an explanation, and that has happened multiple times with him. After it happened like twice I talked to him even though it was hard because I felt I had to set boundaries and be strong. So I explained that when he says he's going to call I am expecting his call and it's not good for my mental health to wait around an hour for him to decide he wants to talk. I said I am totally fine if he has to cancel because something came up (I now know how sporadic and strict rehab can be so I get that things come up, plus he's mentoring new arrivals and has random meetings and talks to his sponsor. I understand it's kinda crazy.) I said his recovery comes first, I just need him to communicate with me and tell me as soon as he can so I'm not wasting my time waiting around. He apologized and said he'd be better. And he was a little, for a day or two. But last night he did it again. 

He asked me if we could talk after I got home from work and I told him what time I'd be home. I sent a message when I was home and he said he was going to grab a shower then send me a message. Then nothing. For 2 hours. Even after I sent one to check. Meanwhile it was midnight and I got upset. I'm sorry, I've been very patient and understanding and explained how I felt in a kind way. I'm pretty sure it's fair to ask for enough respect to let me know if he can't talk. That's all I'm asking for. I left him a message after he didn't show that I care and I want to be there but I need him to tell me what's going on because I'm not going to wait around for a call forever and I need to know he's okay, too. He replied today and said he wouldn't make excuses, that he forgot to check his phone and fell asleep, that he knows I have anxiety and he'll try to make sure he's there when he says he will be. I appreciated that response but like...I almost feel like I'm pulling teeth or like forcing him to talk to me even though he's the one that wanted to talk. I don't want to be a source of stress but I also don't want to let him walk on me and I don't think he means to. But I especially don't want to be investing so much in a person who doesn't even want to talk to me. I'm pretty sure he does though so it could be my own doubts. It's confusing. And now things are awkward and I feel guilty for seeming to demand so much.

Sorry if I'm rambling, I haven't really talked to people in depth about this and it's a jumbled mess in my head. What I need advice on is where to stand firm and where to be lenient. What's fair to expect? I feel like I need to be clear about my own needs because even though I naturally want to put others' needs first all the time I know I can't pour from an empty cup. But I don't want to put too much pressure on him or lose him. I know he could easily take advantage of the fact that I care so much if he wanted to, maybe without even meaning to. I've been blown off by people too many times in my life and I don't put up with it anymore from friends or dates. Too many times in the past I've waited by the phone for texts that never came. I hate that feeling, and I don't think he realizes how much he's putting me through. The one night that he didn't show up I had a panic attack and was anxious all night. I told him about it and turns out he'd been anxious too but avoided me instead of talking about it. Which also bothers me, but I understand anxiety at least. He's opened up to me about personal stuff that I don't think he'd tell me if he was detached, but then he avoids or blows me off, only responds to part of what I said, stops chatting in the middle of conversations, and I don't understand. I'm getting very mixed signals. I just don't know him well enough and when we talk there are tons of interruptions like roommate and bad service and breathalyzer tests. Oh and he also asked me to come visit him there. I told him I wasn't sure if it was a good idea, it's a little overwhelming for me, and he said he didn't want to overwhelm me.

I want to support him, want to be a friend. He's leaving his friends that were bad for him behind, he's trying to recover from his hep c, trying to be there for his daughters. He just has so much going on and it's a lot for me, can't even imagine how overwhelming it is for him. I just want to understand how I can best be there for him as a friend, and still take care of myself in the process. I've done a lot of work on myself with my mental health and I don't want to throw it away. Is it unreasonable for me to want him to communicate out of respect for me and my time and hold him to that? I found a 2nd Facebook profile that was his and I think he might've left it when he checked himself into rehab the 2nd time to avoid his old friends but I don't know, he never mentioned it. Is it okay for me to ask about that or is it better for me to let it go? Should I be willing to go visit him in person? Is it bad for me to want to be friends with him since we're both romantically interested in each other? I'm honestly very confused and out of my element. Sorry this is so long. Any advice would be much appreciated."

474,1,"I haven't done it in just over a year, and the last year that I was doing it I hadn't been doing it very often, but for probably around 18 months or so before that I was using almost daily, and using a lot, IV. I never had a problem clenching my jaw/teeth before I started doing it, but obviously that's a big side effect that comes with using meth. I assumed it would go away after some time, but it's been a year now, so I figured it might be a good idea to ask around and see if anyone's had the same issue and maybe found some solutions to helping them stop. I value my teeth a lot, my mom (dental hygienist) really beat that into me as a kid, and I really don't want to end up fucking them up *after* all the heavy drug use."

479,1,"You know believe me, I'm not one of those to complain but these brain zaps are just driving me crazy. I've been smoking meth about 7 times a day. It Varied. Smoking every day for about the last 8 months. I want to get off it for my kids and for me to take a break but in the meantime my withdrawals although no physical ones are present, these brain zaps are causing a lot of mental anguish and I don't need this I don't want this in my life it's horrible. Any suggestion please help! I do have a lot of mental distress not just because of the brain zaps only but withdrawals are causing me depression and anxiety etc"
480,1,"Hi Everyone. I've been at this for a long time (well. im 35 so long enough to feel like shit) and for the first time I'm starting to get really, really, truly scared. I feel like I am close to slipping through the cracks. I am not posting for sympathy, but maybe just a scream out into the void.

I am totally broke and will likely need to declare bankruptcy at some point. I manage to hold a full time job as a Vice President at large corporate bank, but how i still have the job is beyond me. I do very little to no actual work. I drink and drink every night until i cant stand or see. I have called the suicide hotline from my office three times in the last month. I have a three year old boy and wife. I have managed to make life as hard as possible for myself. Every morning when i wake up i basically scream out loud as my life comes slowly back into focus and then cry in the shower. It wasn't supposed to be like this. i hate myself and I hate what i have become.

I hope anyone who has been there is doing better. Thanks for letting me vent. my life has become a nightmare."
482,1,Females who have recovered or are recovering from an ED. How long did it take for you to get your periods back?
483,1,"I screwed up Friday night and drank. I asked a friend 'why can I feel as good as I currently do when I'm sober?' I've had a lot of good days but I've only had 1 great day since August. I'm angry, ashamed and guilty because I ruined 6 months of sobriety in one night. There is no excuse for me drinking Friday night. I keep asking myself why did I do this to myself and the only answer is I'm an alcoholic. I can't even have 1 drink and I envy those who can. I didn‚Äôt want to reset my sober time but I did. 

I now see that I can‚Äôt do it on my own like I thought I could. I know I need to attend meetings. Even if it‚Äôs just one women‚Äôs meeting a week. I know I need to find a sponsor and work the steps. Except I don‚Äôt think the traditional AA steps would be the best for me because of the mental health aspect of my addiction. Another reason I don‚Äôt think the traditional 12 steps will work for me is due to almost all of them talk about god. Yes, in a few they say higher power but it kind of seems like they are wanting to force god as your higher power. If I was to believe in anything, I would believe in the Great Spirits that the Native American culture believe in. I need to buy a workbook for the dual diagnoses 12 steps (I have 2 books currently sitting in my amazon cart. Just waiting for payday to buy them.) 

I learned something from this last relapse... my hang over was much worse this time. You know how people joke about the older you get the longer your hangovers are? Well, my hangovers always lasted a couple of days. This time, however, it lasted 4 days. 4 long days. I cannot allow myself to keep doing this. I have made a new plan when it comes to sobriety and I WILL stick to it!"
484,1,"I'm a creature of habit. I used to get up, get high and then aimlessly roll through my day, dealing with whatever bullshit came up all while blaming others for everything that was wrongs in my life.

In the last 5 and a half months I've cultivated a new normal, and I enjoy it so much more. That being said, I noticed that throwing a wrench into my routine could make me angry or frustrated for the rest of my day. 

My family is wonderful and we support eachother in ways I know Alot of people don't have. Cultivating a new family is possible, and I hope that every single person has that opportunity. 

My mom recently broke her foot, badly. I have stepped in to help her with everything. She does an amazingly large amount of things for everyone in our family. 

I never would have been able to handle this in early recovery, knowing that my routine would be compromised. I am so grateful to have this opportunity to share with you what I have learned. 

If you find yourself struggling with people and situations, take a second and look at your routine. Are you sticking to it? Have you let yourself get in the way of it (ie being lazy, procrastinating,etc.). Is there a way to make a new easier routine for yourself? 

 I wish everyone in this community a sincere and heartfelt new year, I've enjoyed posting and reading posts from r/recovery since I have been clean. I will continue to work at recovery, and I hope that everyone else does to. 

Here's to 2020 being an amazing year."

496,1,"I have a little over 8 months cns, im on my meds and take them as directed and have stretches of amazing days, days i didnt think i would ever have. I have a great job, I have a sponsor, i work steps, i go to meetings, i do service work and the next right thing. Most important i had thought and still believe that i found my Higher Power. 

With all of that said i am of the suicidal type of addict. My DOC was opiates, meth and LSD. While using i lost friends to our disease, saw other do long stretches in prison, familes ripped apart, my door kicked in a couple times, been robbed here and there and stole my fair share from stores. Im saying i qualify for my seat in recovery, i earned this bad boy. 

So, the good, the bad, and then there's this. MY MIND CHANGES ITS THINKING WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I can not for the life of me know why other than i had used heavy drugs for 36 years, tell you why this happens. One day im great then out of left field comes suicidal thoughts, the want to get high and self sabotage and it scare me to death. I just dont get it.

My life has always seen me run away in times of crisis. Numb out to see if I'm going to weather the storm. The last few days have been just that. My family didn't like how happy I seemed, so they accused me of using, the next day my mom broke her foot quite badly and now needs surgery.

I've been a twat at times, and I see this only as an opportunity to use my knowledge, and take care of the ones I love. Use my time to take care of someone who's taken great care of me.

0,1,"Might be kind of long I apologise. So where to start I'm 26 a year ago I was in a 5 gear relationship ship had maybe 3 years clean. Long story short relapsed on heroin and held a full time job gf found out then saw o was on needle again tried to quit meny times wds etc eventually she left I quit my job went homeless lived in truck, crashed truck went to jail for a month. Family let me move back. Got on methadone but   am not high enough dose to fully help. Have been also using h 85% time with it.


Taking along time to get to where I need to be one methadone 100mg plus. I don't get sick 8f I don't use dope for a couple days but have insancr cravings for dope even tho I feel like 50 percent of it. Im back living with family who want me to get out of this funk of ex gf etc so I got on methadone. Hard time finding job rn and then this coronaviris has just made me more depressed. I do about 20 a day h with my methadone and I don't have much money so a family member has been helping me buy dope. I'm at 72 mg methadone just up 5mg a week

 so I calling inpatient even tho I'm in outpatient to try and clean up. But Corona is slowing that way down I just feel so bad and am so down I hate narrowing money like this but these cravings are fr. I just feel I'm pushing everything to the limit I'm just like existing.. idk what to do. I'm really trying so hard but am procrastinating.

 I sometime get Ballsey and get some meth and then m up for 2 days and regret it and need black to comedown so have to ask for more money or I sit here heart racing til I can find a way to come down. I had it all,lost it and am now stuck in this funk.

 I know my family wants the best for me but I'm procrastinating on doing what I know.i need to do."
1,1,"I have only tried smoking weed a few times and tried an edible twice. I liked the feel of them. Now that I want to quit my opioid addiction, will weed help me feel better during the process? Will the pain and depression from the withdrawal cancel out any pleasure or relaxation weed could give me? I‚Äôve detoxed myself several times over the last 2 years and know how the whole process works and feels. My current addiction is pretty week and the acute part will only last 3 days. I use Kratom and klonopin but will happily add weed to the mix of it helps.

So will weed help me relax and feel better during the acute withdrawal phase?"
2,1,"Just got off a week or so binge after having a month clean and doing so well.. really thought it was gonna stick for a while but I slipped up and used once thinking I had it under control when really it turned into a week long binge which I knew deep down that‚Äôs what would happen. Now here I am at square one in w/d once again.

With that being said I‚Äôve found myself in this cycle of getting some clean time whether it be weeks or months and letting my guard down and using again. However once I start feeling withdrawals I‚Äôm pretty good at stopping myself... the problem is the chronic relapsing..

I don‚Äôt want suboxone or methadone but does anyone have any tips at all.. I‚Äôm so sick of this shit no human should have to withdrawal this often"

5,1,"5 months back I started taking Oxyneos 2-3 times a week.

Im currently on the 2nd day of quitting and I dont know what to expect which scares me.

My main questions are how bad should I expect my withdrawls to be? Will the extended release make quitting harder or easier? How long should I expect to feel like shit for a 4 month habit?

I have hundreds of grams of kratom that I will occasionally use if needed (I know its not the best way to quit oxy but I feel like I need it sometimes) I also have weed pens and dxm which ive heard helps in low doses?

8,1,"I was taking codeine on-and-off for 4 years starting from when first learnt about CWE. This meant maybe once every couple of weeks. I took breaks for months at a time.

This Christmas, I started using much more frequently: doing about 150mg of codeine every other day to deal with stresses.

I've now been coping with withdrawals at home and it's getting easier (physically). There are cravings and I don't know what would happen if I relapsed and took codeine again.

Would that **reset** my progress? Would I have to go through all the pain again?

9,1,"After a few failed attempts at detoxing at home, my so opted to go to a facility for 5 to 7 days to detox. Prior to his relapse he had been sober for almost two year. He has done rehab in the past as well and lived in a halfway house for a few months before we met. I just want to know what going to one of these facilities is like. I am grateful and happy that he went as I see this as a fresh start for him. I know the road ahead is not an easy one. I just have been worried as to what he is going through while in there? How he will come out of there? What thoughts will he have while detoxing? This is all new to me as I have never dated an addict nor do I have any addictions myself. Please help me get out of this total mind fuck that I am in, Just worried, scared, happy. really going through all the emotions."
10,1,"So I been doing fetty for at least 3-4 years. To the point where nothing else gets me off sick. Curious to know if anyone has had the issue of getting new shit. Having it be pretty decent. (Not getting me high but at least allowing me to get through the day. Sleep 5-6 hours at night).  Well usually if the shit stays the same unless it‚Äôs really fuckin good it will be coo for a week. Maybe 2 and then it will start to drastically decline. What used to keep me cool for 12 hours is now only around 4 hours. Can‚Äôt make it through the night anymore. I understand tolerance so on so forth. But I‚Äôm not taking about getting high. It‚Äôs not that it was getting me high now it isn‚Äôt. It literally was carrying me through the day now it isn‚Äôt even getting me past a few hours. I could even understand a few spikes. Say I was used to doing a half G a day and then 2 days in a row I hammered 1.5 or something. But no. Anywhere from .3-.5 a day is all I do. 
So I was just wondering. Has anyone else had these issues and almost lost your fucking mind over it. I laid in bed awake alllllll night last night. Wasn‚Äôt sick yet but not comfortable enough to fall asleep. All I could think about was not doing this shit the next day and fitting my other dude that I know always keeps fire. Only problem is he‚Äôs one of those ya I‚Äôll be there in 15 mins and it‚Äôs 2-3 hours every single time. Well when your sick as fuck and you think your getting cool in the next 15-20. Then a hour goes by. You call. ‚ÄúYa my bad bro I‚Äôm about to pull up‚Äù another hour goes by... idk about any of you but that shit has had me ready to lose my fucking shit a few times. So most of the time I just can‚Äôt afford to wait like that. Today however I‚Äôve been so irritated and fed up with the last week of this shit. Blowing money everyday not getting right is the worst shit ever. Especially when you depend on getting right to be able to do simple things such as eat. Drink. Sleep. Function. 
Well today I hit my other dude. No answer. Waited an hour. Still nothing. So I‚Äôm thinking to myself there‚Äôs no way I can wait and hope this dude answers at some point just to wait another few hours for him to pull the fuck up. So I went back and got the same shit that hasn‚Äôt worked for me the last week now. 
Has anyone else done this? I mean I feel fucking crazy. The night before when I‚Äôm at least not deathly sick but not feeling good still I will sit and say man there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting this shit again tomorrow it‚Äôs not getting me where I need to be blablabla. And then no sooner than 12 hours later you got the same god damn dude coming through because you justify in your mind like well. It at least gets me feeling alright for a little while(just doesn‚Äôt have legs at all) so I basically suffice being sick to get right for a few hours. Fully knowing that I won‚Äôt make it through the night again. But i guess being ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù of being sick on that shit all you care about is right now. Getting right now. I‚Äôm not thinking about sleeping tonight when I‚Äôm sick as fuck right now. But idk is that crazy? I mean is it crazy to do that knowing it isn‚Äôt doing it for me just because I can‚Äôt wait another few hours to get something I know is going to be alright for me? Idk I guess to myself like.... I feel like that‚Äôs fucking insane to keep doing to yourself. I mean it‚Äôs torture for sure. Because you know like well I‚Äôll be ok for a few hours. But what about after that? The shit is crazy to me the type of suffering you knowingly put yourself through. A lot of times I‚Äôve just thought about shit like man..... even tho withdrawal is the worst shit to go through. At least worse than anything I‚Äôve ever went through I really do feel like with the way this shit has been for me it would be easier to just fucking quit the shit. I can‚Äôt stress enough how fucking terrible it feels to start the Hustle at 8 am. Doing whatever you can to get money to get you through the day. As fast as you can before you get sick enough to where you can‚Äôt even function enough to hustle. So usually that takes a few hours. Then you gotta make the moves. Then you gotta try and hope your few normal people are around and it isn‚Äôt going to be another 2-3-4 hours to wait on them..  so what starts at 8. Finally gets worked out 4-6-8-10 hours later.... just to end up getting something that either doesn‚Äôt carry you through or fuck at times I‚Äôve gotten shit that literally wouldn‚Äôt even get me off sick. So if you look at it that way I mean... your laying in bed all night trying to sleep. Not feeling well. Getting sicker by the hour. Then you finally make whatever moves or do whatever you have to just to get 40-50-60 dollars to get right. And you end up getting some ducking trash ass shit that doesn‚Äôt get you right. Or you fuckin....get something that at least takes your withdrawal away but within 2 hours you already start getting chills and your stomach is already rolling over and shit. I mean motherfucker. Ya know if that just happened once or twice in a week cause bad shit is going around or whatever the reason is it pry wouldn‚Äôt be a make or break situation. But when you been trying to quit for literally a solid year and a half now... and your sick 2-3-4 days out of the week. Every week. I mean fuck me. Cause I will go a day or 2. Sometimes even 3 before I fucking break down and use because I can‚Äôt handle being that sick for that long. Well when you have done that for a year and a half. I mean the toll that shit has took on my mental status and my body is seriously no joke. It‚Äôs given me worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever had in my life. So bad that now when I try to quit I mean I‚Äôm lucky if I make it all the way through the first day just because I‚Äôm so fucking scared of how horrible shit is going to be for 2 weeks minimum.  Between that and I‚Äôve also secluded myself. When I decided it was time to stop a year and a half ago I started trying and I can‚Äôt be around anyone when I‚Äôm sick like that. So of course I secluded myself. Well after trying and failing for a month or so I had lost contact with mostly everyone I knew. And the fact that I kept trying I mean before I knew it another 3-4 months had went by of my trying to detox on my own. Being sick half the week and using the other half. That rollercoaster now for the last year and a half has fucked me up so god damn bad I can‚Äôt even explain how I feel and shit now. So I was just curious if anyone else has went through the issue of having shit be coo for a week or 2 maybe and then all the sudden not even be able to make it through a night using the same exact shit....idk. I‚Äôm always looking for other people‚Äôs experiences and shit because sometimes I just feel like god damn. I feel so fucking terrible and I just wonder like man. Has anyone else been in a similar situation to where they have went through something similar and can give me some insight as to what I can do to try and stop the cycle or maybe some context as far as how some of you have felt in a similar situation?  
Sorry about the longer posts too. I just always have so much shit to say. 13-14 years of this fucking abuse I have a lot of different stories, thoughts, questions so on so forth. Appreciate yall. Be safe through these hard times we‚Äôre still having."
11,1,"Hello All,

I detoxed are home on 2/24 from a massive opiate addiction that was 10 years in the making. It was the hardest damn thing I‚Äôve ever done. I had to quit my job in order to have the time off and that came with its own struggles. After a few weeks, I started looking for work and then the virus shut everything down, especially in my field. Money was running low, my gym closed, and no jobs were calling me back. The PAWS started getting more and more intense. I forced myself to continue meditation and spent hours every day applying for jobs. I got the call this morning that I have been hired into a good company and will have benefits again in 3 months. I can pass a drug test with my own urine and can‚Äôt wait to take that test. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I could legitimately pass one. If you‚Äôre reading this, just know that it does get better. I promise you that the voice in your head is wrong when you tell yourself that you can‚Äôt change. I‚Äôm not even close to perfect, but at least now I can work on myself instead of always working on getting high. Much love to you all."
12,1,"I was able to make it 16 days before I ended up lying straight to a family members face to get another bag. Not sure what went into me. I made sure I had no money at all but when the temptation came I resorted to whatever I could. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel now. I had 40$ from them and only spent 20$ Incase I got ripped off so nothing would stop my relapse. I got my dope and honestly had an amazing 2 days with it. I woke up yesterday feeling like shit and was literally walking to my car to go pick up the other 20$ I had before I just hit a moment of clarity and realized what the fuck I was doing.

Not too sure how to feel now. I spent that 20$ on weed and even thought I stopped myself from using I just can‚Äôt stop craving it. I tried to smoke some old foils last night and that got me a little high for the night. Hopefully I can start my new job soon and things will be on track for the most part."
13,1,"Because it gave me something to focus on other than my failures and shame and guilt and anger and depression.

Now I'm sober all these feelings and thoughts are hitting HARD and it's overwhelming, to say the least. Things I haven't thought about in years... since I was a teen. Flashbacks is the best I describe it - both little and big. and combined they're just so overwhelming.

Hope everyone is staying healthy and strong out there. Take it an hour or a minute at a time if needs be. ‚ù§"
14,1,"So I was arrested once when I was 18 (right before starting university) and once at 24 after I dropped out. 

How are you dealing with finding a job? Did you finish school and did the arrest make your degree moot because it comes up in background checks? Or did you stop thinking about going to school because of the arrest or arrests?

I'm 29 now and the arrests have gotten me super depressed. If you google my full name (since my full name is unique) both my arrests come up with the local news. This has made me not want to go back to school and I've just been jumping around jobs or working for family. The pay is obviously always shit. I had to move back in with my parents after the second arrest to be able to afford my habit. Now I'm getting paid too low to even think about moving out.

Just at a loss of what to do and the depression and anxiety is killing me.

Any helpful tips or advice or personal stories would be much appreciated."
15,1,"Day 36 off fentanyl, and I have to say - things have definitely improved. 

At day 10, my crying spells and bipolar moods started subsiding. 
At day 14, my cold sweats and days of wearing two pairs of clothes to stay warm started to go away. 
And at day 21, I stopped having sleepless nights with incessant thoughts of worry. 

But a lot of things are still the same. I still am paralyzed with apathy. Social connections are still forced. And, worse off, after everything I've gone through I still don't regret it and think daily of how nice it would be to use. When did this last one go away for you guys?

A lot of my daily habits had to stay the same and I am forced to confront situations or places where I normally would have used. I kept one bottle of old prescriptions so I could know I beat opiates, and it wasn't the availability that was holding me back. I know these two things don't really help, but I am adamant that I will not use again. It's just the thought that I still don't regret my use and that I still crave the feeling that taunts me. When did you guys shake these feelings? Will they ever go away? Any supportive comments more than appreciated, thank you guys."
16,1,And I feel human again after 14 years. I was lucky enough to have the luxury of detox in jail lmao but ive been out for a couple of weeks now and the only thing I've been struggling with is dealing with the anxiety of dealing with other people. Is anyone else like this ? But to get my kids back in my life I have to do it.  To anyone staying clean today..you're kick ass . Keep doing the damn thing.
17,1,"I've been wondering what it's like to be out there in active addiction right now and also feeling like I dodged a bullet this time. Jumped from subs 45 days ago. Just saw this vid about how the virus is impacting heroin and meth. So im just sharing fyi

https://youtu.be/0ez3r3fRNPI"
18,1,"Noticed there's like no April fools stuff going on today. Makes sense, now is really not the time for that shit unless it's done real tactfully.  

So last night I had a dream about dope for the first time since I stopped using a year ago. Crazy shit, really goes to show that the demon is always lurking. I think I dreamt it because currently I don't have the obligations that were keeping me from wanting to use even one tiny bit, and although I still don't want to on a surface level, subconsciously it doesn't surprise me that my mind is like ""ya know what would be cool right now? Getting high!'  

It was weird though, in the dream I had like found a bag and a half and told R and we were going to split it, but like most dope dreams, people kept like interrupting and we couldn't find a chance to do it. But a big difference from when I was in active use was that in old dope dreams when i was still using, the whole ""have the dope but can't do it"" thing induced like serious panic and anxiety, but in this dream it was more of a minor inconvenience and I even remember thinking in it like ""aw well if I don't get to do it it doesn't really matter, it's not like I'll be sick"". Which I guess is kinda a good thing in and of itself? Idk. Also I typically never really dream, prob from years of smoking weed before bed so that I can fall asleep, but this dream was vivid and memorable which is so damn rare for me.  

Yesterday was actually a good day! My school has started up online again and i had one zoom class and one phone conference call class. I honestly missed my professors and am sad that two of my classes are no longer doing sessions Cuz I really got along with those two profs as well. I didn't realize how much I actually seriously missed school, there was even some classmates of mine I was happy to see/ hear. I woke up early, did my hour of yoga, actually put on makeup and got dressed, did like 5 hours of homework after my classes were done, and then I ordered expensive but delicious BBQ delivery Cuz it was Rs 26th birthday and our third anniversary. Also had really good sex before we went to bed which is always cool. Can't believe this is our fourth year together, shit has been fucked up between us and I still am unsure of if I do want to end this or not, but ofc a part of me does love and care about him a shitton even if I get irritated by him on a day to day basis (quarantine has obv amplified that).  

Anyway. Hope everyone is hanging in there. We got a whole nother month of quarantine now so... we gotta get used to this üò£ I was really not holding my shit together the first two weeks or so but I think school is going to be my saving grace here in giving me some sense of purpose and obligation as well as productivity. What have been some of the main things helping you guys stay sane during quarantine? Anyone started getting into any new hobbies or revisiting old ones? Well, love y'all, stay safe guys, n have a good day üíú"
19,1,"My husband is trying to stop using. He has Suboxone to help with the physical withdraws, but it's the mental ones that make it almost impossible for him to quit. How can he alleviate some of this pain? He tells me it's the worst depression/pain he's ever felt. That his brain stopped being able to make itself be happy in any way. What can he do?"
20,1,"First off I‚Äôve been reading posts on this site for a week because a coworker told me to check out reddit for support and I‚Äôm finally making an account to start posting so here goes nothing; 

             I‚Äôm a 22m to start. I started doing Percocet when I broke my back 3 years ago today. (Broke my back having a seizure quitting xanax cold turkey trying to get clean) so my post basically is me asking for advice ive been taking Percocet ever since. The doc stopped prescribing a couple years ago and I resorted to getting them from friends. I‚Äôve been laced with fake ones multiple times in the past when I went to new people which I don‚Äôt do anymore, now I can spot them easily but I still have not been able to kick the habit I‚Äôve made it to 3 weeks getting off but something always gets me back I have to work to provide for my family as I have a newborn so I don‚Äôt want to go to rehab and not be able to provide. I‚Äôve tried suboxone and it makes me throw up everytime ( yes I take the right amount) I‚Äôve cut my dose down to 25% of what I normally took daily so I am doin better but I just can‚Äôt get the monkey off my back please give me some feedback. üëç thanks reddit"
21,1,"I'm not so ashamed to meet my own eyes.

Strange. This feeling of shame lifts sometimes and doubles up other times - mostly when I'm high.

Does anyone else find themselves doing something similar?"
22,1,"Hi guys! Today im going to detox and im going to stay there for a month to detox from subutex, i‚Äôm on 4mg subutex and was wondering what is the best way to taper from it while being there, remember that i only have a month and i want it to go as smoothly as possible. Also any advice? Going to long term rehab after i‚Äôm through the worst part."
23,1,"I (23F) am 7 months clean, and am still having a really hard time accepting the weight I gained in recovery. I know my body is so much healthier and happier now, but I guess I'm just having a hard time adjusting after being sickly skinny for almost two years? 

I finally started going to the gym about a month ago but now they're all closed bc of the virus, so I guess i'm just looking for ways to stay out of my head about myself until we can all leave the house again. 

What'd you guys do to mentally adjust to such a sudden body change?"
24,1,"I‚Äôm done, but I‚Äôm so scared. I have a bit of opiates left, but I want to stop. I have tapered and cut down the past few months, but I want my life back. I‚Äôm terrified of the clarity I‚Äôll get, but also can‚Äôt wait for it. I am also terrified of the withdrawal. I have some things to help: Lyrica, Ativan, kratom, muscle relaxers and can get lope OTC. Any other tips of meds or supplements? Any other advice? I‚Äôve lost a lot, but not everything and I want to create my own bottom? Rock bottom doesn‚Äôt have to mean homeless, alone, completely broke and strung out for everyone. I‚Äôm anxious and scared, but our brains want to keep us comfortable-even in the worst situations. 

I know this time is rough for many-I am here for anyone and believe in all of you to get through this!"
25,1,"3 months ago i had to quit cold turkey, i lasted two weeks before relapsing ( the third week i took tramadol which actually got me high and i didn't expected it, because i never thought my tolerance would go so low that i would feel anything from such a weak opiate, so i took it for a week, and  then i got back on morphine and i was back where i  started ) and from what i remember, i was still sweating all day  long even at the 13th or 14th day clean...

And now with the virus, my country is on lockdown so i've had to quit cold turkey again, i've been clean  for 5 days and i'm sweating all day it's so annoying, even worst today for 3 or 4 hours i had a very big craving where out of nowhere i started to feel extremly bad, restless leg like never before.. I don't think i'm going to be able to last 10 days or even more like this honestly, i'm going to lose my mind, two cold turkeys withdrawals in not even 3 months is really hard .."
26,1,"Today with all that's going on it's important to make sure we are taking care of ourselves! Hopefully this post can help at least one person who may be struggling with AnXiEty or Depression. For me, I take care of myself physically, mentally and spiritually. For those who care to have a form of a higher power, whatever that may be for them I would ask you to have faith.There's plenty of things you can be doing at home to take care of yourself and stay busy/active. First and foremost I'd challenge whoever may read this to do something nice to someone in need for free, expect nothing in return. I guarantee that gesture alone will make you feel better about yourself than any SSRI (antidepressants) could.

Also, very important to stay on top of your fitness and hygiene, step out for a bit and get some sun! Do some push ups, sit ups, ect. Get creative! You get the point..

Long story short, life on life's terms can be real rough sometimes. I promise you, no matter how bad things get, things will NOT get better by you picking up a drug.

If anyone needs a chat message me I'm here and more than willing to help out a fellow addict, as are most people in this community. Take care!"
28,1,"I've been off subs for 1 month now! It only took a whole 5 years (I know). Prior to that I was using for about 6 years, this has been such a weird month with everything going on along with this. It wasn't easy hopping off but I was just over it. I'm still trying to figure out how people go day to day completely sober, then again I don't even really know what ""normal"" feels like as an adult. Over the past month I've done a lot of thinking and realized how many personal relationships I messed up during my using and a bunch of other things I've just been pushing away, I've kind of been forced to confront them over the last month, and it hasn't been easy. I don't feel any better like I was hoping, mentally I mean, though I'm sure that is bounce back/paws. Physically I feel quite a bit better, being able to just wake up in the morning or finally being able to sleep in. I'm sure PAWS is going to last quite a while, but I feel like my medication does help a bit? Anyways I just wanted to share with someone, there's no one I can really share this with in person. Hope everyone is having a great day though!"
29,1,"I watched a doctor online describe the best method for weaning off suboxone... 

Using his advice, I developed a ten week titration plan using 2mg subutex. Using this plan, I had VERY minimal withdrawal until I completely jumped off... then wds were tolerable. 

There were moments in that first week I had to tell myself the feelings wouldn‚Äôt last forever... and they didn‚Äôt. The worst thing was probably the RLS at night which can be mitigated with take by folic acid or getting a rx for a non-addictive muscle relaxer like Robaxin. I didn‚Äôt get this bc of pregnancy. Clonidine may have been helpful at times too for heart palpitations once quitting completely. 

Using this plan, I had no stomach upset and minimal intestinal distress. 

Here‚Äôs the plan I followed that I started in Jan. 2020 (jumped off 3/11) that went something like this: (I started on 6mg and I divided my daily dose into usually three different doses) 

The numbers are in MILLIGRAMS PER DAY- 
              Sun  M. Tue. W.  Thurs.  F.  Sat.

Week 13: 1. 0.5.  1.  0.5. 1.  0.5.  1. (The 0.5 was hard bc I liked to take it at least twice a day... had to use tweezers or my nail to pick it up)

Week 15: 0.5.  0.  0.5. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX DONE!! 

I‚Äôm 20 days clean today. 
First week was a bit rough but tolerable. 
Second and third week have been hard in terms of motivation. 
You (and I) have to know that it‚Äôs going to take your body time to repair the wreckage this drug does to all your ‚Äúget up and go‚Äù and pleasure receptors. .. knowing it‚Äôs temporary is key. 

I‚Äôve been taking folic acid and black seed oil ... now otc unisom to sleep. Making sure I keep eating and showering and staying positive, using Biblical wisdom /verses too 

30 days is supposed to be the total duration of physical withdrawals. 

I have been blessed with support from people around me.. you‚Äôll do good if you have that too if you‚Äôre doing this yourself. 

Im taking one day at a time and doing the next right thing."

31,1,"I dont have a kratom issue. I just dont. It's not compulsive for me. Its just not good enough. However, at most once or twice a week, 5 to 7 grams of kratom will get my mind off dope when I feel like I'll crack.

The PAWS symptoms just suck, so much.

I know if I did dope twice in a week it would set me back. Way back. The kratom doesn't seem to cause any worse feelings to come up on the days I haven't taken it, ie the majority.

I truly think I have no issue with it. Kratom is just barely good enough to take this often. I have a ton of suboxone I haven't touched during withdrawal or PAWS, even though 0.5 mg would probably actually get me high. My issue is dope (and normal pharma if it was around).

My question is has anyone had success scratching the itch occasionally, not daily, with kratom? 

And is it a real fact that any level of opioid use, including kratom, that provides relief of PAWS is setting the healing process back? 

I want to feel truly well some day, and even if I never do and end as a opiate lifer, I want to say I tried and I tried properly.

PS I'm 5 weeks clean with one slip up about 3 weeks ago."
32,1,I think I got the date right today
33,1,"I suffer from migraines, I used to treat these with neurophen plus (OTC medication in the UK, each pill contains 200mg ibruprophen and 12mg codeine.)

4 tablets would cure a migraine almost instantly. I fell in love with the cozy opiate high just as quick. I began to take them for any minor reason, then soon enough just for the high. 

At my peak I would take 2 packs per day (32 tabs per pack) this would be two doses for me, swallowing 32 tabs at once. A pack for breakfast and a pack for dinner. 

Of course they work a lot better on an empty stomach so I would often starve my self to achieve optimal effect. Surviving on just a small meal before bed. 

I soon realised the excessive amount of ibruprophen wasn‚Äôt great as I‚Äôd often be in great pain with stomach cramps. 

I turned to the dark web to source pure codeine. After a while it just didn‚Äôt do it for me any more. So I decided to purchase oxycodone instead.

I would scratch off the coating and crush the pills in a mortar and pestle. I would snort roughly 30mg every half an hour for a whole day, every day. (Around 400 mg per day)

Luckily, I work from home so this wasn‚Äôt a problem. I could maintain a high and get my work done. However, my habit became very expensive. So I decided it was tine to stop. 

I ordered a pack of alprazolam (Xanax) in an attempt to mask any withdrawals I might face. I thought I was being very clever and had it all figured out. 

I ran out of oxy on Friday, (27 March 2020) took my last line of oxy at around 3am

Just 6 hours later the post man unwittingly dropped of my saviour. A 20 pack of 1mg Xanax pills.

I took a couple and skipped Saturday, it felt like time travel. I‚Äôm unsure if I blacked out or passed out. 

Sunday I must of blacked out and eaten the lot. 

This sent me in to a manic episode. I plunged a screw driver through my wrist, clean in one side and out the other, narrowly missing an artery. 

Luckily, my house mate caught me just before I managed to amputate my toes with a pair of bolt cutters.

I went to the hospital and was given the all clear, I bailed before my mental examination as I was worried I would get sectioned and would be unable to work. They gave me a number to ring for methadone treatment. 

I called them the following day and was told they are no longer accepting new patients do to covid-19 and to contact my GP. My GP told me there was nothing they could do and to just go to A&amp;E if I have suicidal thoughts.

I‚Äôm currently on day 4 since my last opiate dose, it‚Äôs hell. My skin feels like a soggy jumper that I can‚Äôt take off, my bones are freezing but my skin is hot. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat. It‚Äôs extremely easy for me to simply buy more opiates. But I want to beat it. I‚Äôve just ordered some kratom. Hopefully this will offer some kind of release.

I have only been using daily for around 6 - 8 months. How much longer will I suffer? I fear the temptation to ease my pain will become to great to control."
34,1,"Well, can't believe I was able to make it through. Yesterday was honestly my hardest day. The insomnia of not sleeping for 2 days, and the extreme leg cramps were driving me crazy!! But with the support of this group and lots and lots of battle's in my head, I made it! 

Finally after being up for 2 days, I crashed at 10:30pm last night, and slept solid till 4:30am! Not to bad at all. Today I am actually feeling better. Legs still feel like they weigh 100lbs, but the extreme pain has gone down to a full ache. Still having mild episode where I get that jolt of electricity through my body. But it's dying down. A few days ago it was constant. Like fire burning through my body. 

Doing a lot of self reflection this morning. While I sit outside with my coffee and listen to the bird's chirp, it's like I have a new pair of ears. Everything seems more enhanced. I'm appreciating the little things. The things you don't care about when you're numb. 

But one thing that really hit me this morning was, as I sit drinking my coffee. I thought how great a feeling it is to not have to wake up and shove pills or kratom down my throat to start my day. For 10 Friggin years I chased that dragon. Always planning, worrying, sneaking, or lying. So much time devoted to feeding my addiction. I also think of all the vacations and events, or weekend getaways I missed out on because I couldn't last without my drugs, hard to cross a border with non prescribed oxys. And kratom requires a hand bag with a bottle, scooper, and lots of OJ. It's a really nice feeling to not have to worry about this anymore. 

Have a few questions from recovering addicts. Around what day did you start feeling better. Where you felt like you wanted to get up and actually accomplish something? I still feel so deflated to want to do anything but lay around. My body feels so heavy. Everything feels like a huge task. Even taking a bloody shower. Just no motivation to do anything."
35,1,Going to take my first Naltrexone pill in the morning to see how I react. Hopefully the Fent is out of my system. If it goes well with the Naltrexone I can get the Vivitrol shot Friday. I have a job interview in the morning for a Sawmill. I've been desperate for a job for a few months now and haven't had any luck. I might not get this job tomorrow but ya know what? I'm okay with that. I'm just going to keep pushing until I do. Wish me luck fellas. Stay safe!

37,1,"I‚Äôm at a loss and just need some advice. A family member (let‚Äôs call her Jill) has been on Methadone for 20 years. It was originally prescribed by a doctor for migraines, but the doctors office was shit down 4 years ago after being investigated for being a pill mill. Since then, Jill has been going to a methadone clinic and paying $112 per week. She has since lost her house, her job, and seemingly all motivation.

Her unemployment ran out last month and she can‚Äôt reapply until August. She has been unemployed for over a year and is not getting many call backs, especially with the COVID-19 stuff happening. She also seems to lack motivation to truly put an effort into finding a job and didn‚Äôt even start applying until a couple of months ago.

Since she lost all income, she is relying on me to pay for her methadone each week, which is putting me further and further into credit card debt.

I can‚Äôt do this anymore financially, but I don‚Äôt want to see her suffer from going cold turkey. She‚Äôs in her 50s with no health insurance. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
38,1,"I posted here maybe a month or two ago for encouragement and some kind people gave it.. i made it a couple weeks then relapsed again, hard, going back to the needle even though i swore off that ROA after getting a massive infection a few years ago that landed me in the hospital for 3 months with a Picc line getting Iv vancomycin... now i‚Äôm stuck staying with family outside the city, no good way to cop, i could finesse it but i really don‚Äôt want to, i just want to feel normal again. The withdrawal isn‚Äôt as bad as it was last time, mostly just sweating shivers rls and a bit of the GI nasties. I‚Äôm trying to take it one day at a time but it‚Äôs hard trying to act normal with my husband and his family. I have no comfort meds, just weed. I‚Äôm trying to tell myself it‚Äôs not worth it to go out, it‚Äôll just prolong the inevitable, but anyone got any tips for feeling better and getting some good sleep? Without any meds. Should i order some kratom? I‚Äôve had success with it before. Sorry for rambling, just trying to keep myself sane. Much love."
39,1,"Ive had hep c for about a year now. As of december i got labs done to start at the methadone clinic and they said you have hep c. I went in to see my doctor and they said oh ya we tried telling you but couldnt get ahold of you. Even tho i was in an affiliated inpatient rehab and had scheduled visits every 2 weeks. Either way ive had it for awhile recently found out. Since december ive been jumping through the hoops that my insurance and the gastro set up. Like staying clean for 6 months with regular u.a's and showing that your active in your recovery. Since this outbreak tho ive heard that compromised immune systems are at a higher risk had mr a little worried. I called my doctor and they told me they got the go ahead to treat me sooner. Now fingers crossed that the medication works. 

Im so happy. Today is 106 days clean as well."
40,1,"So for a little context. I am 21 years old, I‚Äôve been taking pain pills daily in high doses (so high I couldn‚Äôt even tell you) for about 6-7 years. Last year I tried to get clean, went to inpatient program and slit my throat the first night and was discharged. Tried suboxone got me off for 100 day‚Äôs but I relapsed and went back. And from June 2019-now I have been going sober, and relapsing, sober, and relapsing. It‚Äôs a cycle I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve detoxed. And I‚Äôm tired of it. I‚Äôm 3 days clean, going through hell of course. What course of action should I take if there is one? How do I build by willpower to stay off them? And simply how do I stop? I know those questions are very complex I‚Äôm just so desperate. I would appreciate input."
42,1,Every damn time i use opioids for a day or two it usually takes me like 6days to feel okay again... why does the consequences of these drugs have to be harshest of them all? I wish i could have more control over internal opioid production. Got damn boi.
43,1,"Okay, I have to be honest. I have skimmed at least one article. But, that's down from continuous news binging that would last hours. Days. Weeks. 

I would be up till the wee hours of the morning, reading the freakin news. 

Now I feel... some relief? A little sanity? Maybe even a moment of calm every once in a while. 

I can only imagine what that fear does to cortisol levels. 

Now, if you're trying to do this -- there will be challenges. Want to check your email? Whoops, there's the news! Like to watch a comedian on YouTube -- yeah, more of that. 

In every scroll, there it is. Calling to you. 

But... I try to imagine how I will feel after. Shitty. Scared. I'll start to ask myself questions like, ""Do I have enough canned beans?"" ""Should I buy that crossbow at Dick's Sporting Goods?"" ""Do crossbows even work? And what the f-ck am I going to do with a crossbow?!"" 

You get the picture. 

Just typical life in lockdown."
44,1,"Kicked a heavy heroin habit (snorting *a lot* of white powder) using kratom over a year ago. Still taking kratom 30 gpd &amp; it‚Äôs completely destroyed my life. I have set up a plan to kick this habit soon as it‚Äôs at its end with me. My SO kicked the same heroin habit the same way only kratom has never really built an addiction to her body she‚Äôs one of those who could just stop it whenever. 

I‚Äôm already setting my plan up to detox, planning to get back in school etc. 

Well my SO has had a severe toothache for weeks now, starting at the beginning of COVID lockdown. She has called &amp; called to see an emergency dentist &amp; they say they‚Äôll call back &amp; set her up but they never do. She calls back &amp; nothing ever happens. She‚Äôs resorted to her primary physician which prescribed her antibiotics, &amp; painkillers... (she was drug tested to attain the prescription, she legitimately needs them)

One reason kicking the habit has been so easy (with exception of having nasty kratom) for me is bc I‚Äôve not had access to the actual drugs. I don‚Äôt hang around anyone with them. And it doesn‚Äôt bother me until I know I *can* get them. I‚Äôve told her to keep them away from me &amp; I don‚Äôt want to know about them. But still it‚Äôs on my mind &amp; she will ultimately give me some if I ask. This is horrible bc she needs them. I shouldn‚Äôt be thinking this way, I‚Äôm a cruel horrible person &amp; it should be so easy for me not to entertain any ideas of having meds she needs....&amp; yet it‚Äôs like oh well we could just have a nice party together, it‚Äôs only one night huh? This sucks. 

I‚Äôve been closeted about my addiction the whole time, no one has ever known other than my SO. So I have no support &amp; no one other than her I can talk to."
45,1,"So I‚Äôve been trying to quit oxycodone and xanax, and i came across this stuff called kratom in my smoke shop about a month ago, and it worked great like methadone or something! But now after trying to quit kratom or lower my doses i get very sick, the symptoms are pretty much identical to opioid withdrawal, so i turned back to taking Xanax to get off of the kratom then i just ended up taking them together. Does anyone here have experience with kratom and how might you overcome this? Any answers are appreciated :-)"
46,1,"Let me first start off by saying that I've been a long time user. Almost 10 years. It's been a bloody roller coaster. This all started when I first got my wisdom teeth taken out. I was prescribed some Percs. I always told myself I would never do drugs. My father was a heroin addict and left when I was just small. So I always avoided pills up till this point. Only some weed. 

When I first got my script of Percs for the first time, I said, well can't hurt. Doctor prescribed. I remember my first opiate high. Off only 1 perc. It's was amazing. It made me feel like superman. My mind was clearer. Everything felt easy. Made me feel I was just a better person. Only if I could go back in time. 

After awhile the 1 perc didn't work. So went up to two. And then 3. Eventually my script was done. And I was back to work. I felt like I needed to find more. After talking to a few guys at work, explaining how I had Percs and loved them. I found a few contacts would were willing to sell. Back then Percs were given out like candy. Fast forward a few years I was taking them every day. Wasn't a huge habit, never took them at work. Always after work. 

Then one day my wife found out. I was forced to quit cold turkey. Luckily it was a huge habit. 15mg of Percs a day. I had to work and came home and just suffered on my couch. I managed to stay clean for about 2 years. After that a close friend of mine was going through cancer, docs where giving boat loads of pure oxycodone. My eyes just lit up when they showed my the amount of bottles they had. That they would never use. That's when shit got real quick!! 

During the next 4 years I had been taking oxys every day. Both morning and night. And at my peaks was taking about 350mg of oxycodone a day. Friggin insane. I was clouded by the warm feeling I was invincible. But great things were happening in my life at work when I was on them. I was a high functioning addict. I was climbing up the ladder at work, getting good money. Buying cars, bought houses. I put all my success on taking this devil of a pill. 

Then my supply ran out about 2 years ago. I was forced to tell my wife I had been using again and it was really bad! I had to take a leave from my job and had to tell my boss. I tried to go to rehab. Spent 3 days alone in some strange house with 20 other addicts all strung out. Just shaking and sweating like crazy in bed. Body feeling like I was breaking into a million pieces. I had to leave. I remember calling my wife telling her I can't do this in this nut house and had to come home. That I could do it at home with my families support. 

After getting home, I was in rough shape. As any person who has gone cold turkey knows. This led me to trying to find something to help as I couldn't take it. Then I found this miracle plant kratom!! Again.. bad idea. From then till now I've been on kratom taking large amounts. With a oxy dealer who would call once a month with oxys to sell so I'd jump off the kratom and on to the oxys till they ran out then back to kratom. Up till two weeks ago I was taking 200mg of oxys. Or 40 to 50grams of kratom a day. 

Then Covid-19 hit... Everything locked down. Panic everywhere. My dealer didn't want to give up his supply because of uncertainty. My kratom supplier shop shut down. Which forced me to finally get my life back. 

Any addict has always wanted to be clean. After going through many withdrawal we think of our life before we went down that road with opiates. Don't know how many times I cried wishing I never touched these. How I lost so many years of my life with my daughter because I was high. All the time wasted chasing that dragon. Never being able to go anywhere because you couldn't go without a supply. This is my time now. 

Today is day 7, I managed to spare my kratom sparingly and 2 days ago finished that with my last dose only 5grams. My mind is strong, I know I will never go back again if I make it through this. I never want to go through this torture again. Yesterday I found myself extremely emotional. I went through the first 3 days of sweats, shaking, diarrhea, and extreme leg cramps and gooseflesh. 

Today it's now 2am and I can't sleep for shit!! My legs are killing me so bad. Even on day seven!! I have a supply of gabapentin which I started on day 4. It really helped, but now not so much as I don't want to Go higher than 600mg per dose.. I wish I could just sleep and get rid of these leg pains and I'd be set. I thought it would be gone by now. 

Guess I'm just looking for some support and maybe suggestions to help push me through here as with the way the world is right now, and how I'm feeling just makes everything feel hopeless. I do have clonidine. But not sure if I can take with gabapentin. And when I took last time in rehab it made me feel like I was going to faint. 

Thanks for reading, hoping everyone else going through the Same thing right now because of shut downs is looking at this as a golden opportunity. To think when this lock down is over we're going to come out of this clean!!! Even writing that gives me chills. I've dreamed of being rid of all this! Especially that nasty kratom. That green sludge that taste like dirt and grass. Trying to gag it down without throwing it up. Or the money I'm going to save. 

Thanks!"
47,1,"Listen, what if, I mean what if here.... Your doctor closes? What if the pharmacy runs out? What if manufacturing stops it slows? You want to have more than a one month supply. Just my thoughts"

49,1,"Just started. Need support

Hi all. I just started suboxone maintenance on Thursday (16 mg/day). I was living in transitional housing and had 6 months clean, I was doing really well. Last Friday, I got a Xan from a fellow coworker and was off and running from there. I hit the streets and had a 30 hour binge using all the dope and hardware that I could get my hands on. I blew through my whole bank account and only stopped the binge because I got arrested and have a pending charge for possession of Heroin, crack, paraphernalia, and prescriptions that were my buddies (my first offense). I have gone through the whole Vivitrol thing many times but always skip my shot; so I am now giving suboxone MAT a try. I can‚Äôt move into any transitional houses while on this treatment so I‚Äôm staying at my parents until further notice. I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôm worried, I want to get sober but I haven‚Äôt been able to because I can‚Äôt help but always have reservations in my head to use. The Subs seem to have been helping the cravings since I started but I still crave that euphoria I get from dope. Anyways, I appreciate this forum and would like to congratulate you all for getting sober. Thanks and wish all of you a happy and joyous life."
50,1,My wife has been wanting to drink wine in the house the past few weeks.  We have fought about this in the past and I need some help explaining to her why this is not good for me and why it bothers me so much.  She is not an addict and only drinks a couple glasses.  Any help would be appreciated
52,1,"So I‚Äôve been clean from heroin for 5 years now. I used for 6 years. I won‚Äôt get into all the details of that  I just want to see if anyone else has ever felt this ...possibly strange feeling that I have. I feel myself missing who I was on drugs. Well parts of who I was. I know that sounds...unusual but hear me out. I am a naturally dependent person. I don‚Äôt like going anywhere alone. I‚Äôm shy, I have the worst anxiety. When I was on drugs, most of my time was spent alone. Copping in a dangerous city. At night, alone. All the time. Stealing to support my habit....it was horrible, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Being a raging thief for sure sucked. But there were aspects of my personality that I wish stayed. I was so independent. And bold. And I could talk to anyone. I was completely different. Nothing else has ever brought that out of me and I don‚Äôt think anything ever will."

55,1,"A big part of what helped me stay sober was going out hiking and making new friends. All of that came to a screeching halt 3 weeks ago as I am in one of the hardest hit corona regions of the country (NYC metro area). Everything is (understandably) closed, even parks in my area.

I‚Äôve been in a constant drug induced haze and stuffing my face snacking due to endless anxiety and social isolation. I need to stop. 

It‚Äôs so hard for me to find motivation to do so as there‚Äôs nowhere for me to go anyway right now, but I am sick of piling on weight. Also, the few friends I have are becoming suspicious as I‚Äôm asleep a huge portion of the day. 

I can‚Äôt keep spending 90% of my life high or in bed sleeping. When this corona mess finally ends I am going to regret that I wasted all of this time.

What is out there to help people stop? How can I get more motivated to stop when there‚Äôs nowhere else for me to go now anyway even if I do get sober?"
56,1,"Hi everyone this is my first post!  I only just found the courage and strength to admit and ask for help a couple weeks ago, I went from a 200mg a day heroin habit to 11 days cold turkey using ibogaine to interrupt my addiction and give me a chance to fight it. It interrupted the first 4 days of withdrawal after which i woke up with 70% of the withdrawal symptoms gone. I also feel that it has helped my brains dopamine levels to go back to normal and greatly lowered my feelings of depression and anxiety. I would like to hear from anyone else here who has tried it or has successfully stayed opiate free long term after using it. Stay strong everyone I believe in you! Edit: this is in no way meant to advocate a medication or meant as an offer of medical advice, please seek advice from a professional if you need help!"
57,1,"I'm 22. Started using 2 years ago and have been on and off. I will use for a week to a month, and then quit cold turkey for 1-2 months,then relapse. My life is pretty shitty right now. I've lost everything but hey it happens. I'm 5 days clean off a 2 month opiate binge. My vivitrol shot is Friday, I know I'll make it till then. I was prescribed Naltrexone last friday but I'm waiting to start (making sure my system is flushed). I've never came at my addiction with anything other than cutting toes to the people in that life and just going cold turkey. For the first time I feel like I've got ammunition for this battle with my addiction. My biggest concern is what will I do after the shot? I know that some people do the 12 step, some people go to NA, others just try to heal on their own. I'll be going to a NA meeting Weekley anyhow, but I know I have a lot of mental  recovering ahead of me and that's what worries me. I need a plan I can stick to with goals. Just dont know how to go about doing that. I'd like to hear how any of you stayed clean after getting the shot."
58,1,"The anhedonia is the one making me relapse every time. The act of not being able to feel pleasure. I hate it.

59,1,"Morning y'all. Another beautiful day in quarantine üòë I'm soooo stoked for my school to start back up online on Tuesday. Finally something to give me more of a sense of purpose, thank fuck. Yesterday I did an hour of yoga, did some fun colorful makeup, walked the dogs, did some drawing + podcast listening, made really good roast chicken  n potatoes with asparagus, and gave myself a lil spa hour in the bathroom again (ie doing face masks, listening to more podcasts, and smoking a joint while laying on the bathroom floor with my yoga mat and neck pillow lmao). Slightly better than other days in terms of productivity but still not great and real fucking far from my normal standards.  

I actually had a legitimate craving last night while I was sitting in bed it was fucking weird. Not enough to actually make me contemplate attempting to go cop or anything, but definitely like a sharp kinda spike in my brain that was like ""you know what would make this antsy pent up feeling go away? Heroin would make it go away"". I shook it off and got over it but man it's been a long ass time since anything of that nature has happened to me, at least that strongly. This quarantine im guessing just hits close to home for a lot of us, as in being reminiscent of the days we used to spend isolated inside away from the world focused on nothing but getting high.  

I dunno. Im hoping I can use the motivation from school as momentum to get other shit done. I've always been pretty all or nothing about life in general (def not always a good thing, more often than not a bad thing, lol) so hopefully this can shift me out of the nothing into the all. Tbh I'm hoping there will be some type of video conferencing involved just so I have a better excuse to actually get dressed and do my makeup!  

On another note. My home city of NYC, my motherland, the place I love most in the world and is an integral part of my identity, is getting absolutely ravaged right now. As well as a huge number of laymen, doctors, nurses and nursing assistants, orderlies and paramedics are getting diagnosed in huge numbers, sometimes having to return to work despite a positive test due to sheer lack of personnel. My heart fucking hurts for our brothers and sisters on the front line, going into battle with this virus without the protection they need. They did not sign up for this. No one in their right mind would sign up for this. Sure, they knew if (when) a pandemic came they'd be busting their asses, but not with a disgustingly callous (on the part of government and hospital admins) lack of PPE.  

NYC is really in the trenches right now and I wish I could do something but I don't know what so in true desperation I've been praying for them, as well as all the healthcare workers across this nation and world, every morning when I wake up. I pray for everyone else on the front line without PPE too- grocery store workers, janitors and sanitation workers, infrastructure workers, even police- despite the typical hatred I reserve for them, they have done and are doing a lot to help deal with this situation, at least around my neck of the woods, and many of them are interacting closely with sick people and the general public with no PPE. I only pray when it's fucking dire straits. I am a nihilist in the true sense of the word but due to my religious upbringing my brain will default and start praying in really severe situations. Never did I think I'd live through a time so severe that I'd wake up and pray every morning.  

Well, I hope everyone is hanging in there. To those who have been trying to avoid news etc of the virus, understandably so, sorry for my rant. It's just really been weighing on me- no human should have to be in the position that we, apparently the richest and ""most developed"" industrialized nation in the world, have put our front line workers in and it just kills me that there's nothing I can really do. If y'all would prefer to keep the virus talk to a minimum (as in news about or relating to it, not the effects of it like shutdown and quarantine,seeing as that pervades all of our daily lives to the extent where it would be near impossible to avoid mentioning it) let me know and I will try not to mention it, if there's a wide enough consensus maybe we can make a few loose ground rules or make a covid related questions/ venting weekly or daily sticky post like some other subs have done if the other mods think that might be a good idea. Im always down to keep this sub as minimally regulated as possible which historically has been fine but if y'all do feel a type of way please let me know!  

Man this was way longer than it was supposed to be. Ah well y'all know me by now it always is. 20 days until im a full year clean, yay! Love y'all, hang in there, and have a good one. üíú"
62,1,"I just got a year sober. I honestly can‚Äôt really believe it. Like most of us, I had it rough. I worked as a prostitute, stripper, lived in a tent on the side of a freeway, lived in a car for a year and a half and finally went to jail for grand theft. I‚Äôm from Santa Barbara and moved to Santa Monica to get sober. My life today is beautiful, I live in a small studio four blocks from the beach, I have the dopest pet cat, I speak with my family everyday and I am able to show up for the people I care about. I‚Äôm in school and employed - or was before this pandemic hit.  Most importantly, I love myself. I no longer look in the mirror and hate what I see.

63,1,So this is a crazy question. Friends BF OD and is no longer with us unfortunately. I‚Äôm questioning her story she says they did their last dose in her car when she dropped him off. Together for safety (injection H) and he was found in his bed the next day. If they were in the car and blood takes about a minute to cycle through your whole body how did the OD happen on the fifth floor in his bed? You can‚Äôt go to bed and they your body shut down is she lying? Did he lie and have more and did it his self? Is it possible 15 minutes later it hit him fully?
64,1,It probably won't show up in pee but can it interfere with the Suboxones effects?
65,1,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm not a huge thread maker kinda person but I need to vent this out somewhere and hopefully hear some encouraging words from you beautiful people. Hoping I don‚Äôt break any rules. I apologize if this post is all over the place. 

So I had almost 2 years heroin free with the help of a suboxone maintenance plan. It was a blessing and a curse to be honest. I ended up losing my health insurance about 3 weeks ago and was forced to wd cold turkey from 6mg of Suboxone (was previously on 12mg/daily)

I live with my father who I love so much. He‚Äôs currently undergoing chemo treatments for stage-4 non small cell lung cancer. This disease will unfortunately probably kill him soon. He is also an addict who had about 3 years up until recently.

Long story kind of short, after being prescribed a heavy amount of Oxycodone because of pain due to his cancer and chemo treatments, my father ended up relapsing on heroin and crack cocaine. While undergoing chemo. While self quarantined because of his weakened immune system...

You guys, I lost it. I was so upset he relapsed. Mainly because I love him so much and seeing him hurting himself while going through this incredibly difficult time broke my heart.
I was also upset because we don‚Äôt have much money and I got laid off from my job because of COVID 19 while he‚Äôs buying drugs and I‚Äôm scrambling to keep us afloat.
While simultaneously enduring horrific acute withdrawals from a 2 year suboxone prescription. I‚Äôve been craving really badly to say the least, this pushed me over the edge.

I relapsed a little over a week ago. My dad and gf, currently staying with us, don‚Äôt know this. It‚Äôs been I believe 4 days since I last used. I‚Äôve been taking kratom to help ease the worst of it which has been a blessing. (Though I know this too is physically addictive and I will need to stop)

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don‚Äôt want to use anymore, you guys. I know all of us, all over the world are struggling right now and to those of you who have been strong enough to stay clean through this difficult time, I have infinite respect and admiration for you.

If anyone has any advice or even just some encouragement, it‚Äôd mean the world to me. Sending love to all of you. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
66,1,"Hey y'all, I took my last dose of Suboxone on the morning of the 20th, so I'm just over 8 days out. Before that I was on about 0.5 (some days more like 0.75 and 0.25 the last two days before I stopped). Mentally I feel pretty decent! A lil bit anxious and emotional but nothing too bad. I am usually only sleeping 3-6hrs a night though. The physical symptoms are what's bothering me the most right now. I still have very little energy, I'm sweating more than usual, and I often feel like I have a chill. Before detoxing I would run pretty much every day. Now I get exhausted almost immediately. I'm still making sure to walk at least a few miles a day though. I'm wondering how long for you guys it was until you regained a sense of normalcy? On Wednesday or Thursday I really started to feel better, but the symptoms described above have not been subsiding as quickly as I expected. On a side note I was prescribed Lucemyra and Gabapentin to help. I've been taking 1-300mg Gabapentin per day but i'm stopping that now too because I don't want to become dependent on that, and I'll be reducing my dosage of the Lucemyra over the coming days as well. Any thoughts appreciated!"
67,1,"So, at the beginning of this outbreak, I consumed and read everything I could. 

Then took a 10 day break with no news

That break was peaceful and I felt okay. Not wonderful, but okay. 

Then... I felt the need to check on things, and went down a rabbit hole. I was checking the news constantly. Read article after article. My anxiety and stress went through the roof. 

Yesterday, I finally decided f-ck this, and disabled Google. I don't want the constant headlines. I don't want to waste hours upon hours scaring myself. 

So, I'm taking a 7 day break. 

If you're reading the news, and feeling anxiety, you may want to do the same. DuckDuckGo is an alternative search app, and you can still get real time directions using mapquest. Plus, DuckDuckGo doesn't collect your data or track you. 

I needed this. 

Day 1."
68,1,"Morning y'all. Ugh woke up all nauseous but only because I made really good brownies from scratch last night and ate like 5 of them and since I barely eat sugar my body was like WHOA what did you do lol. Oh well hopefully if I drink a bunch of water it'll go away.  

Had therapy over this video chat app yesterday.. was difficult to convey to my therapist the kind of stuck, deer in headlights way I've been feeling, but I think I managed to get it across and she explained to me this certain way to look at the things im doing to mitigate my need to constantly feel productive, like don't get down on myself if I'm not doing something that results in output all of the time; but as long as whatever I'm doing somehow furthers me towards a value or priority of mine, don't get down on myself. Dunno if I described it in the best way but I think it's a good middle ground and a realistic way to go about things for me.  

Also finally wrote out a daily routine with times and set alarms on my phone for it and everything so im hoping my self discipline can pick itself up a lil bit. How is everyone else doing? The new season of Ozark came out on Netflix!! Its so rare that I actually get into a drama type TV show but Rs brother and his gf recommended this to us a while ago and we figured why not try it, ended up being one of my favorite tv shows. Definitely a great show to binge if you haven't watched it at all and are in the mood for that kinda thing. Well hope y'all are hanging in there on this rainy ass weekend! Not that weekends even mean that much anymore lol. Love y'all stay safe everyone! üíú"
70,1,"I‚Äôm currently tapering down my methadone and I can‚Äôt sleep, so I thought I would write a little inspirational monologue of sorts, a TLDR autobiography of my addiction which will probably be way too long for any of you to want to read - or just ramble on my innermost thoughts for everyone to see and judge me for; but I am two years clean after over a decade of addiction, and I never thought I would be here in 2020. I‚Äôm not a religious person, but there had to be some kind of divine intervention to get me here, to this point, and I have a weird need inside to help someone, or try to stop people from ending up in the same place I did, so if anyone can learn anything from my years of mistakes that would be great. 

I‚Äôve probably always been an addict, from a long long line of addicts (perks of being from a native family plagued by residential schools amirite) but for me I think it all started when I was just 12/13; and like majority of people it started with stealing liquor from my mom, and then her weed, and then her pills, and then at 16 I tried coke for the first time and would casually do it at parties with friends when I was drinking, I remember (well not really) blacking out on my 17th birthday. 

In college I lived with a drug dealer, so that was great, we used to go to this college bar in a really shady downtown area and party all night, and I would drink every single day of college until I failed out after my first semester and was forced to go back home, in debt and a shame to my whole family. 

After months of living with my family again I set off to give it the good ol‚Äô college try for the second time, and the first day I was there I made some new friends and we would all go to the campus bar pretty much daily. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I showed up to my ethics class drunk (oh the irony) this is when I also started playing with benzos while I would drink, as well as the coke and pills. At some point I went to get my wisdom teeth removed and knew they would normally just give out t3‚Äôs and just lied to the doctor about not being able to have codeine and managed to get some oxy out of it, and then when I was almost done with that prescription a quick trip to the emergency room got me a refill on it. Just kept at this for the full two years and got through college one credit short (it‚Äôs a longer story than I‚Äôm already telling so let‚Äôs just skip that spiral) 

So now I‚Äôm 22, finished with college and moving into a place of my own, I got a dog, I bought my first vehicle (a brand new Jeep), I had a decent job, some new friends, and I would go out to the bar every week with them. I was always the ‚ÄúDD‚Äù because I would only have a drink or two the whole night and much preferred substances to alcohol at this point (please learn from my mistakes and don‚Äôt use and drive) and I used to drive everyone around, and one night I drove a girl home I had just met who gave me some speed in exchange for the ride. Coke was just all right to me, it mostly just allowed me to party longer but I never got the hype. But speed - damn from the first time I tried it I was hooked. It quickly turned into a habit that used up all the money I had, I drove an hour away to pick up and an hour back, I would go to the bathroom just to use at work, I didn‚Äôt eat, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I was just tweaking out all the damn time. 

Now, after about a week of no sleep I came to the conclusion that benzos were a great aid to sleeping, so now not only was I getting sped up all day, I was now adding in a come down habit on top of it. Eventually, after quite a long time of this, my connect got forced into rehab, I had a couple other connects that ended up fucking off and leaving me high and dry so now I‚Äôm in withdrawal, in a deep dark pit of despair with absolutely no end in sight. I started eating shrooms on the regular just to escape it, and then eventually I turned back to good ol‚Äô Oxy, or occasionally Vicodin whichever was easier to get on any given day. I ended up taking a road trip to see my old college buddies, where I would end up getting arrested for the first time. A night in jail, and thousands of dollars in lawyers fees later I managed to get out of it with no jail time. 

I move on with my life, learning nothing, and eventually I buy the wrong shit from the wrong guy and I end up OD‚Äôing on the same couch that I‚Äôm sitting on right now, but that somehow still wasn‚Äôt rock bottom for me and I just keep going about life. I lived in a constant cycle of trying to fight off withdrawals, there were times when I would just try to chug OTC codeine cough syrup to try to feel not so shitty, or CWE T1‚Äôs and T2‚Äôs and drink it at work to get me through when they said I was taking too many breaks to the bathroom to use. No, it took another arrest, the high probability of jail time, losing my Jeep, losing my job, multiple suicide attempts (I swear this body just won‚Äôt quit) losing my ability to pick up anything, and a perfectly timed new friendship to a recovering addict, to finally decide to get clean, and eventually I walked into my local methadone clinic in the middle of withdrawals and was able to get on methadone and get my life together. 

I‚Äôm two years clean now, I‚Äôm a team lead at my new job (well I got laid off because of this virus shit but I‚Äôm guaranteed the job back when we re-open) I‚Äôve got a house, two dogs, I‚Äôm going to be getting a vehicle within the next couple months, I‚Äôm actually happy, not just flooding my brain with chemicals that make me think I‚Äôm happy, and if you would have told me a few years ago that I would be here I would not believe you. Seriously, if I can do it I truly believe that anyone can if they just want it enough, I NEVER thought that I would get clean. I‚Äôm sorry this post was so crazy long, but I really don‚Äôt talk to anyone about this stuff and it was kind of nice just to get it off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my story, and I hope you‚Äôre staying safe."
71,1,"I‚Äôve really been struggling the past few days, being stuck at home and just wanting to use so I could escape reality again even just for a night and I never thought this milestone would happen for me. Grateful I got to get the fuck outta my house for a few hours and spend the afternoon at the beach and my night on a Zoom meeting with my home group."
72,1,"My 30th bday was a couple weeks ago and I decided to quit everything and try to start living. Vaping, the occasional coke, but mostly my 300+mg a day oxy habit I‚Äôve been growing for five years. I‚Äôve quit the pills a couple times, but never for more than a couple weeks, and used a HEAVY amount of Kratom in between. So I was never actually free.


Last night was my first night without restless legs. Today was the first day I could move around the house. I think I actually made it to the other side of the acute stage. I‚Äôve never made it before. What a fucking feeling. I still have insomnia but hell I can deal with that after what I‚Äôve just been through. I got myself Disney+ and I‚Äôm just up all night watching comfort movies. 

Just sharing because I‚Äôm honestly proud. Which is a feeling some addicts like myself don‚Äôt come across often. I know I have PAWS ahead of me and a lot of work. I thought some shared celebration might help keep me going. Even though I gotta say at the moment the only way I want to go is forward. 

I‚Äôve gotten so much support reading through this sub while working myself up to quitting. Thank you all. 

If you need to hear this, it‚Äôs possible to get to the other side. Just Keep Going."
73,1,"To be honest I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this because I know what I'm supposed to do... but I think I just need some support and advice, especially during this strange time. So to keep a long story short I am an addict. It started 6-7 years ago with hydrocodone and then eventually graduated into taking oxycodone. I got up to taking between 4-7 30 mg oxycodones every day. Then it turned into mixing the oxys with cocaine. I heard voices in my head for 2 years straight. I also did a lot of things that I was not proud of. I was homeless, I stole, and I lied.. alot. I went through hell trying to get off of that shit and lost so so much. Just like I'm sure many of you have I lost my whole life savings, my friends, and my gf of 8 years which I was planning to marry, Somehow I got clean and managed to get most of my friends back. I even got accepted into medical school and am supposed to start this fall. So everything sounds like its going amazing right? A comeback story for the books.. so I thought.

About 2 months ago I had a dental procedure and was given 12 5 mg hydrocodones. I figured since it had been 2 years since I used any opiates that I would be ok taking them. I ended up taking all 12 within 2 days. After that prescription was finished, I felt fine and had no cravings at all. I was in the clear. Right? I don't know why but  I thought since I was able to successfully take those 12 without any problems that I could take them again recreationally. What a dumbass... So after that I started getting hydrocodones from my boss. He has a shit ton of them and will give them to me for free basically whenever I want. So I started taking those 1-2 times a week, taking at most 30 mg each dose. I also found a kratom shop near me and would substitute that for the hydrocodone. Still I would only take either/or twice per week. Everything was great until one day I experienced  a very familiar feeling that I hadn't felt in years. It was the FUCKING DREADED OPIATE CRAVINGS. The ones where your brain will not shut up... even if you have no desire to take anything. Ugh

This was about 3 weeks ago and now I can't stop. I can go about 3 days but I haven't successfully made it past that day 3. Well, now I am back in this cycle and I don't know what to do. I have no physical symptoms but the mental cravings are SO STRONG. I don't remember them being this strong even back in the day. It's like I woke up a sleeping giant. I really don't want to tell any of my friends or family out of fear of losing them again so I have no support really or anyone to talk to. I am also scared shitless because I am supposed to start medical school in 4 months. I have so much to lose, and yet I still crave them. I know I can't go back to how I was but its so hard. This whole lockdown with the corona virus is also not making it any easier. Keeping busy is tough as my outlets have always been the gym, playing basketball, socializing, and work. There are also no in person meetings to attend at the moment. I've considered telling my parents and checking back into rehab but I'm not even sure if that is running right now. Man, I am just so disappointed in myself and what has happened. All of that hard work just down the drains. I haven't spent a single dime on anything or lost really anything at all YET. But I know what can happen with this addiction and I just can't let it happen again. Anyways thanks for letting me share and I would love to hear from anyone that has any insight or wisdom they can shed upon me."
74,1,"So I just did my last little bit of fentanyl about 12 hours ago and I feel like shit. I‚Äôve been through detox before where they used suboxone to taper me down but once I was off I relapsed and have been snorting about a gram a day of fent down which may have some H in it but is almost all fentanyl. I have some leftover subs very low dose, a script of klonipin, clonidine, ropinirole, and seroquel and trazadone to help with sleep. Wondering what I should do and how I should do it. Also have some ice which I‚Äôve heard can help. But then I hear others saying I should get oxy or blues to taper off of. Just want to know what might be my best course of action."
75,1,"Tuesday morning was my last dose of fentanyl. I started immediate withdrawals within 6 hours, full blown by 12 hours. As of today, most  symptoms have depleted. I still have slight rls, would it he safe to start my naltrexone tomorrow morning? Is it going to bring back withdrawl symptoms? Or intensify them?"
76,1,"Like many of you here I‚Äôm dependant on prescription painkillers. I‚Äôm prescribed codeine for a herniated disk in my lower back( I‚Äôm 23M). I‚Äôve been on them for coming up to 4 years. I fell head first in love. Everything was warm and I‚Äôve never felt so safe. I went downhill fast. Very fast. I excused my behaviour by telling myself I‚Äôm prescribed them, it‚Äôs okay, a few more won‚Äôt hurt... You all know the story. 

Yet I‚Äôm full of excitement, and I feel strong. Im finally ready to go that last stretch. I‚Äôm working out again, I‚Äôm playing guitar and writing again. I‚Äôve maintained a steady 90mg dose for a while which I take when I wake up and a 90mg dose just after lunch. Down from, at my worst, 240mg doses whenever I felt like it. 

I know It‚Äôs going to be hard and I know every day wont be like this. I am scared. Really fucking scared, to be honest. This has been a crutch for a very long time but I need to throw away the crutch and learn to walk again, otherwise this will be me for the rest of my life and I can‚Äôt do that.

I‚Äôm sick of wasting my life, for fuck sake.  

Just finding this sub and being able to say how I‚Äôm feeling to people who understand opiate addiction, who won‚Äôt judge and have been or are in the exact same position as me feels so freeing, like I‚Äôve stopped drowning and finally able to come up for air. 

Good luck to everyone here, whether your on 1 day or 1 year. Stay safe in these uncertain times. Know that someone loves you and you are beautiful even if you think you aren‚Äôt."
77,1,"I kicked the habit about 3 years ago but recently had cosmetic surgery. They prescribed 5mg norcos - which I thought would be nothing. I was wrong. I get the same familiar rush from just one pill. I hear lots of non addicts say that these pills just make them feel sick or tired, but to me (and from what I‚Äôve heard, other addicts as well) the feeling is more like MDMA.

Idk why but my impulse was to hoard the pills even though I stopped using them 4 days post op because I wanted to be cautious about forming a habit. Right now they‚Äôre in a jewelry box in my closet.

The other day I took out one pill, wanting to take it to ease the anxiety caused by this pandemic and worrying for disabled and immune compromised family and friends. I know taking it would make my body feel good but also make me feel like shit about myself. I put it on my desk and for the past two days I haven‚Äôt touched it. I keep asking myself, do you need to do this or can you do something else? So far I‚Äôve decided to do something else.

I just wish I had a valium or xanax scrip. The only thing making me want to use right now is this horrible anxiety. What are some coping mechanisms you guys have tried?"
78,1,I'm literally getting lab work done right now to check my liver for the vivitrol shot scheduled a week from today. They are also giving me Naltrexone to take until then. I can't believe this is actually happening. Damn I dont wanna mess this up. Anybody have any advice?
79,1,"Y'all watched that Tiger King documentary on Netflix yet? I'm two episodes in. It's reminding me a lot of the S-Town podcast from a few years ago. Crazy stuff man. The memes are starting to make sense.

Check in here."
80,1,"Hey guys,

I've never even posted here before but I thought I might find some like-minded people. To be clear I'm not asking for financial assistance, just some words of encouragement. 

I am an addict in recovery, I have been clean for over 3 years at this point, and just based on where I was at my lowest I'm truly blessed to have the life I have now. This pandemic and quarantine has been tough. I was laid off this week with rent and bills looming, and a young daughter who I need to care for and feed. I'm pretty scared about not having medical coverage for us anymore. I've been extremely stressed and not sure how I'm going to be able to manage financially. I applied for unemployment as soon as I got laid off but who knows how quickly that will be here, and I doubt it will be enough anyway. 

I posted on r/Assistance yesterday because I figured it was worth a shot. I was in a much more emotional place yesterday and wrote a pretty heartfelt and vulnerable post detailing my life, my struggles with addiction, how I was at my lowest, and how I've since then made amends and gotten my life together. I figured even if no one could help me I could at least talk to some people going through a similar situation and commiserate. 

As soon as I posted I got a couple DMs of people with brand new accounts phishing for my bank info. Fine. Scummy thing to do but scammers are scummy and this isn't my first time on the internet. No harm no foul. But after that I just received vitriolic message after vitriolic message. Messages telling me I deserved to lose my job, that I didn't deserve to even have a child, fuck junkies. Again, it's nothing I haven't heard at one point in my life or another but just the amount of hate on a sub dedicated to assisting people really shocked me. I'll be the first to admit that I was selfish and hurt those closest to me during active addiction, but my relationship with most of those people is better than it has ever been right now. I've made amends and it's frankly no one else's business. 

I thought that public perception was starting to shift a bit, at least on Reddit which seems to flaunt it's liberalism and acceptance. But I guess not. I've had a hard week, I'm stressed about how I'm going to get through the next couple months, and I haven't really been able to make it to any meetings lately because of everything going on. It's just really not what I wanted to hear yesterday especially after opening myself up and getting vulnerable asking stranger's for assistance which isn't something I've ever been super comfortable doing.

&amp;#x200B;

And as I write this I can't help but think that there are still so many people who have it worse off than me right now. If you're struggling right now just know that your life is always worth it, and it's amazing how it can change. Someone always loves you. Hang in there everyone"
81,1,"Hey everyone,
     I really wanted to stop my 80mg/day hydro habit. I figured that quarantine would be the best time tbh. I bit the bullet and hopped off cold turkey. Made it to 26 hours and have left over subs in my drawer from before. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I relapsed.

    I am aware that I am an addict. I will not go back to rehab. Again, I do have some subs left over. Can someone please give a definitive answer from experience when to take subs and not have precipitated withdrawals. I read online and here it‚Äôs 24 hours, but then some people say 48 hours. If 24 is doable, but 48 is highly recommended. I‚Äôd be happy with doable. Kratom barely helped me to the 26 hour mark."
82,1,"I know 15 days isn‚Äôt much. 
But I couldn‚Äôt have done it without the shot. 

I don‚Äôt want to get overconfident; but I can see myself hitting the 1 year mark. 

The goal is complete abstinence. I still smoke very little weed. 
Cutting ALL mind-altering substances is the way to go; that‚Äôs when the magic happened."
83,1,"I was on a waiting list before their COVID-19 stuff started. I was going to be on Suboxone sometime around now had things not shut down. My counseller is not able to take phone calls, my social worker is shut down too, and I am facing things that take my breathe away.

My son was born on the 25th which happens to be my birthday as well. My wife and I knew this might happen, but child services will be taking our child today. I don't know when we will see him again because of the virus shutting things down. Well have court next week and I have to find a lawyer so quickly that I don't know if it's possible.

I'm also facing withdrawal anytime soon and angry that it has to take so long to get into treatment. I don't know what I am going to do with all this time.for my anxeity to go through the roof during this lock-down.

I haven't cried yet. I think I have gotten how. So many years of numbing myself and developing a defense mechanism based on pushing emotions down as deep as I can."
84,1,"Preface: yeah I‚Äôve searched for other threads. Didn‚Äôt find anything too new or updated (or with decent info). Granted, considering how long I‚Äôve been on Reddit, I kind of suck at mobile search. 

So...using Nomo. It‚Äôs ok. Nothing more nothing less. 

What are y‚Äôall using? What do you recommend?

Would love an app that has the option for an iPhone/iOS widget. 

Thanks guys and girls :)"
86,1,"Feeling like Rick in the beginning of walking dead when he wakes up in the Hospital and it is deserted lol. 

I have been home a week at my moms(super thankful), and my entire aftercare plan fell apart due to the virus. I had outpatient scheduled, but it was canceled, and obviously AA meetings are canceled as well. 

I had a high tolerance before i went in, about 3g of tar, 2g of powder, or ~1400mg of oxy daily to stay well, with 8-10mg of xanax daily. trying to get clean for the past 10 years, had 1.5 years clean in 2018-mid 2019. 

i did a 5 day sub taper at detox, and was planning to not be on MAT, but been struggling at home, so been taking 1mg of subutex every other day(dose in morning, skip next day, and redose, basically 48 hours apart). 

i know i am basically getting dependent on the subs again, but with 1mg every 48 hours, will that be a hard habit to kick after the virus? 

I have a bunch more questions, but my mind is so very confused right now, with my aftercare plan in shambles. just looking for any advice or support, thank y‚Äôall üôè"

88,1,"A little back story..  I'm 38f with 13 years alcohol sobriety as of  March 5 2020. After my csection in 2012 I got hooked on pain meds. 3 months later,  caught my exhusband involved in a soft porn shoot and he blamed my pain pill use. Went to rehab voluntarily to save our marriage, checked out 30 days later, felt renewed.. but reality set in again. He was a nightly whiskey drinker.. and after a hernia surgery I had 6 months later I thought I could hide my pain pill use. I received positive reinforcement at first for being a better wife and mom, coworker, happy to do it .. focused.. but 8 months later I got sloppy .. I couldn't maintAin it. I had needed more and more y'all know the story. I signed up at a pain clinic to get suboxone b4 I was found out but it was too late. Nodding off at my exhusbands family get together and the next day he took my 1 year old away. Since his family is well known ... later my story short, despite my follicle tests to prove myself clean, the at litem said I was still on an opiAte since I took suboxone and my ex got physical custody /I have to pY support although we do have my son almost the same aMount of time. 

Fast forward 7 years and I've met a man I never believe existed for me. A man of God and integrity. 
Ive quit vaping (nicotine) dec 27.. and was working out b4 I got pregnant. We can't get married yet bc he's on parole. He slept w a 17 yo in Idaho in 2016 and spent 2.5 years in prison. 

I've been on subutex and/or suboxone since the end of 2013. My teeth were already bad but I had to get dentures. My hair is thinner. Overall I look like I e aged gen years in the 7.. 
Doctors need to encourage a slow taper plan after a couple years max.. while offering other meds to temporally offset wd symptoms. My doctor would have just let me stay on it Forever I guess.. going on 7 years 

Hpwever I'm 6 mo pregnant and finally had the umption to do a taper over ten weeks off subutex down to 1/2 mg per day (each drop was a little difficult here and there) but now by the Grace of God Yeshua Jesus it's been 15 days
W nothing but black seed oil, folic acid, and some expired klonipin (1mg) to sleep... Wd symptoms are not bad after first few days (rls was terrible and general discomfort feeling) except for now this .. profound lack of motivation,, problem feeling pleasure (o have gestational diabetes so o can't even eat chocolate and ice cream lol) just SO lethargic it's unreal, shortness of breath.. general depression. Someone tell me this stuff will get better.. I've heard it can take a month and I was on it a lot mg time."

90,1,"How is everyone doing? Im losing my damn mind. Thankfully I don't have a desire to use but this isolation is killing me. I thrive on pressure, I need pressure to be motivated and get shit done. Probably one of the reasons I got good grades and was one of the ~best employees~ at my job. But now that it's just me and all the time in the world, I feel utterly useless. I feel like I don't even exist if I'm just cooped up in my house. Like what's the fucking point. This year was the year I fell in love with the world and realized how much cool shit was out there that I could just enjoy by myself; without the companionship of a subculture or partner. And now that's all out the window for now and the unforeseen future.  

 What is something you're grateful for during this shitty time? Im grateful for my dogs, for my job actively trying to help us laid off employees, and for an apartment with multiple rooms and no roommates. What are some fun/ funny things you've done that prob wouldn't have happened without the quarantine? (CW CANNABIS) Last night I rolled myself a joint, took my neck pillow, my yoga mat, and a low lamp light into my tiny bathroom, lit some incense and put a podcast on my speakers and did a face mask and shaved my legs while laying on the floor pretending I was at a spa, then took a nice long hot shower afterwards. As I was gathering all the stuff to bring into the bathroom I was laughing my ass off like ""girrlll this some quarantine ass shit right here"" üòÇ I'm sure im not the only one finding creative ways to ""repurpose"" rooms of the house!!  

Well, I hope everyone is hanging in there. The weather today is nice so I'll prob take dogs on a long walk. Only thing is they get aggressive pack mentality towards other dogs when they're together (which is 99.9% of the time) and I know mad other ppl gon have the same idea as me and have their dogs out too. Oh well. Holding them is a good arm workout üòÇ lemme wrap up my essay, love you guys hope everyone has a good day! üíú"

96,1,"Hi! I am new to Reddit, just created my account today thanks to a lovely person I met in the land of the internet. After sharing a little of my story with her, she highly suggested I join this group. Here‚Äôs my post hun, I hope you see this! ‚ô•Ô∏èüåª"
97,1,"Hey guys, I haven‚Äôt posted here in a while, but I really gotta get something off my chest because I‚Äôm really frustrated and pretty fucking angry right now. I‚Äôm coming up on nine months clean and I got a sponsor about three or four months into my recovery. I‚Äôll admit, I kind of jumped in and just asked someone to sponsor me without really knowing her. I realized it wasn‚Äôt a good fit about two or three weeks into sponsorship, but I‚Äôm bad at ending relationships, whether it be friendships, romantic relationships, or in this case, a sponsorship.

One of the first things that I noticed was that we only ever talk about her and her issues. We‚Äôre five months into this, and I don‚Äôt think she knows a damn thing about me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve managed to tell her some details about myself, my life, and what led me to seek recovery, but she doesn‚Äôt remember anything I tell her. I dread talking to her on the phone because she talks about her problems for over an hour, complains about the people in the NA groups we attend together, and then hangs up. She also doesn‚Äôt respect my time. She‚Äôll call me at work and I‚Äôll tell her I only have a couple minutes, but she traps me on the phone. Short of hanging up on her, I can‚Äôt end the conversation. I‚Äôll say I have to go, and she‚Äôll just keep talking.

Anyway, a few months back, we had a business meeting after our regular NA meeting. I won‚Äôt go into details, but she had a verbal altercation with the other members. Usually after this particular meeting, we would all go out to eat. It was one of the only things I looked forward to at the time. She seemed to have made up with the group members and said we could still go out to eat, but then she held me back as everyone else left and started ranting about how everyone in the group was out to get her. She kept me there for forty-five minutes and we missed the after-meeting hangout. I drove her home, went to a fast food restaurant, and ugly cried alone in the parking lot while stuffing my face with a cheeseburger. It felt like I was robbed of the only thing that was keeping me sane at the time.

A couple months later, the same thing happened again. She got into another argument with the group members, she kept me from hanging out with them, and she complained about them to me for about an hour. These people are my friends, my fucking life lines. And she shits on them constantly. Saying shit like ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs not how NA is supposed to work‚Äù, like she works a perfect program and no one else does.

And tonight was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. Because of COVID-19, one of the groups I attend has been holding Zoom meetings. It was going great until it was my sponsor‚Äôs turn to share. Something on her end wasn‚Äôt working properly, so we couldn‚Äôt see or hear her. The woman chairing the meeting said that we would come back to her and let someone else share so my sponsor could figure out her technical difficulties. She got pissed off and left. Then came the tidal wave of angry texts. She was texting me saying ‚Äúfuck these people, they cut me off, they wouldn‚Äôt have done that if it was someone else‚Äù. I understood why she was upset, I know she had something she wanted to share because she had told me all about it when I called her this afternoon. I was on the phone with her for an hour and a half and that was the only thing we talked about. And I‚Äôll say it again, I called her. Not once did she ask how I was doing or say anything involving me or my recovery, other than to say ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt called in a few days, you worried me‚Äù. Anyway, I tell her that we couldn‚Äôt see or hear her, and that I understood her frustrations. I was going to tell her that I would attend another meeting with her that night so she could share. But before I could, she started getting angry with me. The person who has listened to her rants and to her talking about her problems for months. The person who drives her to meetings multiple times a week, every week. The person who helps her cool down when she‚Äôs having problems with someone else. And she was fucking giving ME attitude? She was angry at ME? Fucking really? What the fuck did I do? Plus, I‚Äôm her SPONSEE. I‚Äôm not her sponsor, though most of the time it feels that way. And despite her getting mad at me, I still tried to talk to her. She cut me off and told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all good, have a good night‚Äù.

I was on the verge of a panic attack while she was texting me, and I still tried to mitigate the situation, like the idiot I am. This isn‚Äôt what sponsorship should be. She makes me feel guilty about not ‚Äúdoing more‚Äù for my recovery. I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt make seven meetings a week. I have a job (had a job? this whole COVID-19 thing is a terrifying mess) and I‚Äôm a full time graduate student. I have family members who are knocking on death‚Äôs door. I have a lot of shit in my life that I don‚Äôt want to deal with, but I have to deal with anyway. But I still talk to people in recovery, I still have NA commitments, I have regular meetings I go to every week, and I‚Äôm doing step work. But it‚Äôs not enough, according to her.

I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôm done putting up with this shit. I may not deserve much, but I sure as hell deserve better than this. The amount of times I wanted to use because of this whole situation is fucking ridiculous. I should have cut the cord as soon as I realized it wasn‚Äôt working. And she wonders why none of her other sponsees have stayed. I‚Äôm sorry for the long post, and I‚Äôm sorry for ranting, but I have been simmering in my anger for too long. I can‚Äôt share about this at meetings because she‚Äôs always there. I am so fucking upset and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm even going to go about ending this. And she just texted me saying that I should have done something to fix her technical difficulties tonight. Fuck man. I don‚Äôt know what to do."
98,1,So just stumbled across this and have never heard of it was wondering if anyone has and has any knowledge of it at all [accuepuncure](http://elevationrecovery.com/alliance/)
99,1,"I was wondering what the consensus was for post withdrawal paws? I have tried kratom while using regular opiates and never felt anything. One thing I have learned is that I will either abuse a substance or not. Alcohol is safe from me, as is any kind of stimulant, or kratom, I simply hate the stuff. But I would be happy to use it to prevent all the depression and dragged out crap that comes with paws. In the past, when I have taken it, I have never gotten past 2 grams. So would be happy for opinions."
100,1,"I haven't been on in a little while, but just wanted to let everyone I'm still sticking with it! 21 days today off of subs! Longest I've ever made it! Feeling like a new man and every day is getting better! I def could not have done it without the support and encouragement I received from everyone on here, so thank you all! I will continue to check in so I hold myself accountable!"

102,1,"So yesterday I was 13 days clean from subs. Feeling bored but not terrible. I was doing good, not seeking any drugs, not even attempting too. Which I‚Äôm still not, to that I am proud. 

BUT. I have legitimate back pain and last night asked my mom for something non-narcotic, still though she realized how bad I was hurting and handed me two Oxys.

First I said I don‚Äôt want those, but then I took them anyway because I was in pain. Now I feel bad that I messed up and feel like I let myself down, even though it wasn‚Äôt something I was trying to do initially.

I feel ok-ish today, but I‚Äôm paranoid that I will have to start over withdrawal wise physically. Surely not though from just 10mg of oxy right?

Anyway, sorry for the rant. Just feeling like I screwed up, and don‚Äôt want to lose all the progress I made. :("
103,1,Listening on people on Reddit It seems like tapering OxyContin down to nothing  is just about impossible. Is there anyone out there who has done it. What was it like? Comfort meds? I would like to give it a shot. My habit is 300 mg/day and has been going for 1 1/2 years.

105,1,"The amount of people giving medical advice in the comments is incredibly inappropriate.  It's dangerous, and definitely against reddit rules. Every post I've read has someone being incredibly rude or condescending about the use of Suboxone or other medications. Even things like weed. Recovery is about support, this whole community was about the sense of community. Talking and helping each other, not playing doctor. It's a huge issue withing all addiction communities, someone found something that works for them and they wan't to share. Just stop trying to force and ""help"" people who aren't asking for it. If someone is getting on Subs, good for them. Positive people need more of a place in this subreddit, not armchair AODA clinicians. Sorry for the rant, just came back here for the first time in 4 months or so and was appalled."
106,1,"I've been on and off pills to suboxone many times and day 2 is usually good. Yet I got home from the clinic after taking 16mg of suboxone-the most I've ever taken at once. I came home to lay down cuz it was 6am and I was on about 5 hours sleep for last 2 nights. I thought I felt better. Then all of a sudden I'm freezing and I have the runs. I cant sleep.

Wtf?! Look I dont feel horrible, but I do feel shitty. 

Oh yeah so I was taking more methadone then ever. Like 60-90 mgs plus and few blues a day. But the last few days I only took a out 10-20mg of meth and more blues. 

Does anyone know why I'm not feeling better. 

Last info check. I went to clinic yesterday morning and got 12mg of sub of 1 hour and a half in 3 pills. But today I got 16mg at once."
107,1,https://youtu.be/_AzR05IjdCo
108,1,"I have been addicted to kratom for a little over 3 years, and I've been using it *very* heavily. I found a really great suboxone program, they require NA or AA meetings, which is fine with me, that's probably a really good idea. They also work on addressing the root causes of addiction rather than simply treating the addiction itself. Also incredible and exactly what I'm looking for. The only problem is that it requires *complete abstinence* from everything besides nicotine. The problem with that is that I use ADD medication (I have ADD) and I use CBD flower for my chronic insomnia I've had since I was a kid, and my CPTSD when it gets really... bad and traumatic. It's also just nice to unwind after a huge work load, it relaxes my body and mind but I don't get high at all. I've never had a problem with CBD or regular weed, or with my ADD medicine. I use both pretty damn sparingly. I use them purely as medicine, and give myself rules so I don't overuse them, because I know what I am like with opiates. The only drugs I've ever been addicted to are benzos and opiates (both for numbing emotional pain). 

I guess I just wanted to see someone else's opinion. Should I look for a program that is a little more lenient? I wouldn't mind going without these psychiatric drugs for a while because I've had many months where I just don't need them and don't feel any urges to use them like I do with opiates and benzos. But at the same time, when I'm having a hard time, they help me in a similar level as my antidepressant.

I understand the idea that being an addict means you just want to abuse the shit out of everything, but there genuinely are some things I have never had that urge for."
109,1,"So in this time of anarchy with this virus and everything. Is anyone out there detoxing or planning on detoxing in the next few days? I‚Äôve been trying for a long time but now have seemed to back myself into a corner in a pretty bad spot. I don‚Äôt think I would be able to use the next week or so even if I still wanted to. Everyone know the anxiety they face before the real sickness actually sets in. How sick am I going to be? Is it going to be different this time than any of the others? Are the few different meds I have going to work better than other cocktails I‚Äôve took in the past? You know the normal shit we all go through when we know we are going to be looking at a detox. 

My question however now is.... anyone out there wiper super worried about a possible infection while going through detox. I mean idk about everyone else but when I‚Äôm dope sick I‚Äôm not leaving my room let alone my house. So the chances are very low. However it is still possible. So if found myself a few times already before using for the day sitting here with some symptoms and just absolutely freaking out because it‚Äôs going to not only be hard to tell if anything extra is going on through detox. But if it is I mean would you really know? Or would you chalk it up to detox symptoms. Also with a full blown opiate detox going on. If one does have the virus I would have to imagine your chances of not being able to fight
It off have to be 10 fold compared to others who aren‚Äôt dealing with any other outside issues and are healthy. Because everyone knows when your an addict and have been for a while. Your immune system is trash. You don‚Äôt have a proper diet at all. You typical are going to be way way malnourished. So idk. Was just wondering if others out there were thinking about this or if it was just me being overly worried like I‚Äôve seem to grow that way about every god damn thing since I‚Äôve been battling this opiate detox issue. I‚Äôm 33 years old. I‚Äôve went through my entire life with little to no anxiety. This detox shit and being sick and trying to quit now for the last year and a half at least once or twice a week has caused the worse anxiety I‚Äôve ever imagined having. Even when I first felt it the first few times I remember being like ahhh this is what pretty bad anxiety is like. Well it wasn‚Äôt to bad until I dealt with it for a year and a half. Now when it hits it literally stops my entire world and makes me have these thoughts and feelings that I just don‚Äôt know what to do with. Until I use of course then I‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôm 99% sure that it‚Äôs basically massive fear of getting sick and going through
Withdrawal for a week or 2 depend on your use
How often how much you were doing.  

That‚Äôs how my anxiousness continues to be I mean I really don‚Äôt think anything is going to change that until I just man the fuck up and go through it. Anyone with the same experience or similar that has gotten through or anything that maybe made things easier for them to get through feel free to let me know. Thanks ahead of time. Everyone try and stay safe out there in these insanely crazy times. It will get better."
110,1,Hello everyone i just now joined this group/ community through a recommendation from a friend. I have been addicted to fentanyl for quite a long time now and i really want to stop using for the concern of my health and my family. I want to avoid having a serious cold turkey (last time i had one i was puking and shitting diarreah at the same time. Also time to time would be puking out blood. Thid lasted for over a week) but it is not easy tapering down at this point. Any suggestions or methods where i can avoid having a serious withdraw and quitting?
111,1,"Anyone else feel this way? At the moment I run from 15 to 20 minutes twice a day. But even doing alot less than that and working up a sweat once a day seems to do the trick. 
It keeps my demons at bay and seriously suppresses any cravings. It's like a drug in itself to me.
I really can't recommend this enough for any of you who are struggling to stay clean right now. Not to mention you will look and feel fantastic, your sleep will return + an endless list of benefits.

I know getting the motivation to exercise is tough sometimes especially if you are feeling depressed, but you know yourself the fight isn't easy. You have to try. I really had to force myself when I started (and it sucks sometimes while you are doing it) but once I did it afterwards it was instant relief. 
Let me know if anyone else found peace through exercise and self improvement, instead of all the 12 steps and higher power stuff. Stay safe and thanks for reading! :)"
112,1,"Anyone who's been through NA or AA will know how essential the higher power part is, for turning recovery into long-term sobriety. Non-Christians often find a way to God (the individual Creator) via a different face, same substance, like faith in an unknowable omnipresence, a creative universal spirit, benign transcendent Gaia, etc.

So I'm asking anyone out there who's been through NA or AA - or gotten clean other ways - how do you deal with the God / higher power step?

My father is going through the steps (some version of NA/AA) but he talks about this divine higher power as if it's a problem. You know, like he can't get his brain around it. I don't know what to say to help give him what this concept is there to provide. Does anyone out there have a brilliant persuasive angle on the whole faith in a higher power thing?

He has relapsed before but maybe a sincere line of thinking that reconciles reality with the higher power will help make it stick this time around. That's what I'm hoping.

Any thoughts, any advice, any cosmic flash of insight, I'll be very grateful. Thanks for reading."
113,1,I feel really helpless I‚Äôm trying to use coping skills but why am I struggling so hard? Sometimes I just don‚Äôt even feel like getting clean on all these days I take my suboxone. I skipped my dose just that day and used :c
114,1,"So I‚Äòm trying to quit heroin for the millionth time. I went cold turkey with the help of pregabalin. I made it to exactly 60 hours before I couldn't take it anymore. So day 3, that‚Äôs pretty far I think. But today withdrawals got too bad. So I did heroin, but only a small amount. Just enough to handle the withdrawals. 

After this fuck up, will I start at zero in terms of withdrawals or does the progress I already made kinda count and the withdrawals will come back milder tomorrow? I heard people say that breaking up the withdrawal in the middle is a strategy that can work, but I am not to sure about that... But than again, I must have made some kind of progress by going 60 hours without any opiate, right?

Thanks."
115,1,"Hello everyone, 

I dont post very often so sorry in advance.

I am 7 days clean cold turkey and I just need to vent my mind.

A little background: I have been addicted to diacetylmorphine for About 2 years now, which started with my mother disappearing voluntary, because of her being heavely manic depressed/bipolar.

Since then I fucked up a lot.
-school was going to shit, so now I have a year off.
-Was fired from work.
-And obviously financial troubles because of the addiction. 

I have been to rehab 3 times now And was given suboxone afterwards, which I tried to taper, but giving me very long withdrawel on seizing.

I have been clean for nog longer than 3 months in a row, and this fucking life has been tough.I have been so consumed by this escaping of reality.

And now being taken in by people I met in rehab, giving me a home when my dad kicked me out. I just have to say, I am so Done with this way of life.

I decided enough is enough. But I was Scared shitless having to withdraw for 2 weeks.

This time was different since it wasnt the long suboxone withdrawel.

I am currently 7 days in. Slept good for the first time in this what feels like a way longer time. 

I Thank whoever is watching over me or has a good heart to me, giving me the strenth to endure what I havent been able for over a year.

I Also want to Thank everyones post, giving me perspective, appriciation And sympathy of emotions.

I am determined to conquer, no matter how Many times I have to do it all over again. Failure is part of the journey, And I keep failure close to me, as I do not want to have it overthrow my vision.

Have a good day, And to all: Nothing is impossible if you start believing in yourself, And set goals for yourself."

122,1,"So, I have a bunch of 5mg Methadone tabs and I was wondering the smallest effective dose that can be taken in order to keep away withdrawal. The person in question has been on Oxy for 3 years now at daily doses of 30-40mg. Is it fine to provide a decent first dose of methadone, like 20mg, and then maintain at 5mg per day for 10 days? Since the half life is so long will 2.5mg in the AM and 2.5mg in the PM work the the next 10 days?

I also am wondering how much methadone I will need for myself. My oxy habit was 200mg a day for about 1 year and recently dropped down to about 60mg/day. 

I only need this to work for 10 days until I get my new script for #120 10mg Oxy. I have other things to help in the process like Weed, Temazepam, Gabapentin, and Adderall for the lethargy. 

 Any info with specific details would be greatly appreciated, if you know the best way to help with what I have. Thanks!"
123,1,"I've been taking opiates for around 8 years. Started when I was 17, took random pills from family and friend's medicine cupboards mainly tramadol and codeine. I also took many other drugs during that time such as ketamine, MDMA, cocaine, LCD and countless others but I always preferred the warm comfortable feeling of an opiate. 

As I got older I managed to get a small monthly prescription for codeine due to a ""chronic"" issue, where I live codeine is available OTC and I had friends with genuine problems who were more than happy to give me whatever they had, tramadol, oramorph. 

Eventually I weaned off of tramadol and oramorph, have been taking codeine every day for the last 4 years (besides some breaks for holidays to places where opiates are incredibly illegal and ending absolutely hating my entire trip because I've felt so ill). I have managed to stop cold turkey for these holidays but have always gone back to it. 

My country is in lockdown, I have around 10 tablets left from my prescription and can't really buy anything over the counter with the lockdown. Fed up of driving round to pharmacies to buy more medication and hoping that they don't recognise me and fed up of being so dependant on something. I can't even calculate how much I was taking a day, way over the ceiling dose and it no longer has any effect on me other than making me not feel like shit. What's the point?

I took one tablet this morning, 30mg, which is probably less than a tenth of what I have taken most other days and I'm doing this. I don't have much to help me with this other than vitamins, paracetamol and ibuprofen but I'm going to do this. I've had chills and sweats all day as prior to this morning at 9am I hadn't taken any since 1pm the day before and I have a gnarly headache but this is nothing compared to the rest of my life free of this. I don't want to move on to something stronger and I physically cannot take any more codeine and I do not wish to move back on to tramadol or anything stronger.

I know this isn't anything compared to what some of you have gone through, are going through and hopefully will not have to go through again but I'm posting this to reaffirm my decision and for any tips or tricks people might have."

For those of you still on the grind, good luck to you. If you‚Äôre struggling, I hope you‚Äôre able to make it through, and maybe able to use this as an opportunity to gauge if it‚Äôs still worth it. I don‚Äôt mean to preach or lecture, but I‚Äôm rooting for you.

125,1,"I am taking methadone and staying clean, and not having to lie anymore is such a huge weight off my shoulders, but every goal seems so distant. If you could only see ten feet in every direction, every step would feel like a great success, propelling you to your desired destination in no time. But if you can see you're surrounded by a vast desert, walking feels futile. Thats how I feel about recovery. I share these thoughts in my latest video.

126,1,"Anyone notice when you sleep and wake up you actually feel super super cold at first. Stomach feels super weird. Usually have. A fair amount of anxiety right away.

I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong. If I get something the day before that‚Äôs not very good. Sometimes it may still carry me through the night ok but I‚Äôll be sick by the time morning comes around for sure. I was just wondering if others go through this and why?

127,1,"So I‚Äôm on Day 8 off opes. It might not sound like much but it‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve been sober from any kind of opiate in over 8 years. I was always either getting ahold of pills, dope, subs, methadone, and finally decided it was time to free myself from opiates. After 2.5 years of methadone treatment, I took my last dose (1mg) last Sunday. Day 3-6 were rough, and then yesterday was the first day I started feeling better.. not as much pain, and for the first time in a long time I felt hopeful, happy, and like I can‚Äôt wait to be myself again.

Masturbation is destroying my mind and body. I cannot continue to watch this negative material and think that I will be mentally intact. It is self-abuse not self love. 

Food, you are an old nemesis. I know you will do nothing but stretch my being. You will only offer fleeting comfort and you are unworthy to control my life.

I am committed to being content with less. All of America is in correction so why not follow suit. I don't need that new car, house, clothes on credit. My worth is measured in how much I earn not how much I can borrow.

This too shall pass."
129,1,"Day 7 of being clean. And by clean I mean...I‚Äôm on bupe patches - MAT - but I‚Äôm 100% \*done\* taking almost 2200mg of codeine phosphate per day for 3 years (and 500USD oxy habit for the 10 years before that). 

I know I can‚Äôt be alone here. 

Opiates to me were never about fading out. I hate the nod. I didn‚Äôt want the relaxation effect. Didn‚Äôt care for the passing out with the cig burns on my sofa. I don‚Äôt say this looking down on those who were after the nod. I‚Äôve had my fair share of experiences. But to me, if I wanted a nod, benzos would have been my drug of choice.  

To me, opiates (oxy and norco and percs and roxy you name it - never fent nor H, always pills for me) were my ADDERALL. 

Like when my college roommates took amphetamine salts to pull an all nighter and study, or to get interested in a project....I took a few hydros for the same affect. 

Which leads me here....

Bupe patches have helped me feel like a normal person. And that's great. No cravings at all, which is also great. I have a taper plan...great again.

What's not great? I'm under quarantine until April 12 at the earliest. Stuck inside. And I'm really, really bored. 

Detoxing - even on bupe - brings about lack of motivation issues. And boredom issues. 

SO....while I'd normally pull out 20 codeine pills, or a few Oxynorms...and get hella motivated to do a project or read a book...and sitting here staring at a wall. 

All I've heard is - to combat the boredom/lack of motivation - is some version of the following:

1. Find a hobby
2. Keep yourself busy

The thing is...I have tons of hobbies. My biggest right now - one I actually have a passion about - is continuing to learn Spanish to a fluency level. But without that oxy/codeine ¬¥kick¬¥, I'm finding it so, so, so hard to care enough to write a notecard, let alone lift up a pen. 

As for keeping myself busy, I can only clean my apartment so many times.

So - for those who used opiates as their ""adderall""...how do you get the motivation to CARE about real life things again? How do you fight the boredom?

This is hard enough in real life, but doing it during a quarantine....wow. 

Any and all advice appreciated. And here's to day 8 coming up - small victories, yeah?

Thanks for any help - love y'all"
130,1,"Today is day 56 and I was just denied my second vivitrol injection. Have been through the most hoops over this bullshit. My initial shot was delayed until day 26 or something because I tested positive for fent until day 18 and fent metabolites at a level of 1.2 nanograms per ML up until last test before my shot(day 22). At that appointment (which was my third scheduled one to get the initial shot) the Doctor finally just agreed to give me the oral dose and see how I reacted, everything was fine and they went ahead with the shot. Now this morning my lab tests came back from March 18th and my fent test was negative (haven't used since January 27th so duh) but my fent metabolite level went UP by .1 to 1.3 nanograms per ML!!!!!!! Are these tests even that accurate at that low of levels?!?!? And this time they denied giving me the shot, want me to repiss Friday and schedule shot appt for next Wednesday (9 days). Frustrating is an understatement. Not to mention everytime I have to do the screens it costs me $150 out of pocket since they have to be sent to a special lab. Now I'm also worried that even though I didn't get the shot today it may count as one of my 3 free internal medicine visits, after which are used up in liable for $2800 out of pocket for the vivitrol injection. Currently out of work for 8 weeks because corona virus situation. Vivutrol has completely resolved me of any cravings but now I'm worried that going at least 9 days past my 30 days on the shot for the next appointment cravings may come back with a vengeance. Trying to stay strong and keep the positive outlook I've had thus far but to say this is maddening and a serious black cloud over my mental state is an understatement. Joked last post about this in Feb after going through the 3 appointments and rounds of piss tests that I felt like Jon Jones and the picogram scandal but now that my results went UP by .1 nanograms I LITERALLY feel like that situation and its a nightmare. Ugh."

134,1,"Hey guys. Hope everyone's doing well (&amp; inside) and not outside licking doorknobs and coughing on old folks. Just thought i'd post about my short term recovery and how i feel on day 14 of my withdrawal. 

A bit about my background - I've been psychologically tied to opiates for about three years (used sparingly back then), and physically dependent for about a year. I've been snorting pressed 30's for the past 8 months, and in totality, i've spent 3 of the past 12 months sober. Went 28 days clean in november 2019 but relapsed. I don't think i was really ready to quit then.  

I've quit and relapsed probably 10 times over the past year and a half. Each successive time withdrawing feels exponentially worse. This attempt at stopping, however, feels different. Using did make everything interesting and allowed me to do well in my grad program as well as land a cool internship that i'm currently working at now, but the negatives so heavily outweigh the benefits. I'm tired of constantly thinking about using and i'm tired of being dull and lifeless. I won't pretend that everything was rosy and beautiful before i started my self destructive behavior, but i had more life to give back then. My girlfriend, my friends, and my family all deserve to have the real me back. 

My rough timeline:
‚Ä¢ Day 1's are always pretty easy for me- a bit frustrating but not debilitating 
‚Ä¢ Days 2-5 are horrific. Sweats, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, RLS, insomnia, anxiety, you name it. I've used benzos in the past to knock myself out for this part. It is highly effective, but i figured it was ultimately hindering my long term progress, so i decided to do this kick clean
‚Ä¢ Day 6-9 i started improving very slowly, but i could feel some emotions and physicality/energy return. Started walking/jogging again daily. Still having RLS, weird bowel issues, and riding on about 3-4 hrs of sleep a night
‚Ä¢ I had a blip of depressive tendency on day 10 and 11 and felt that life was hopeless. These two days were incredibly difficult to get over, but the thought of letting everyone down kept me from copping
‚Ä¢ Day 12-14 i keep feeling better every day despite still struggling with sleep. Been getting about 4 hours each day. It's driving me nuts, but hopefully there'll be a light at the end of this tunnel. Physical symptoms have more or less dissipated. 

Three less common things i've learned: 
1. Adderall can help your energy levels in the day 2-5 window (if you have obligations that need tending to). It's not something i recommend for more than a day or two max because ultimately, it is another drug your system doesn't need 
2. Walking, cleaning your place, and running errands helped tremendously with cravings. It sucks to have to get out of bed, but the sooner you force yourself to get up and about, the sooner your brain will heal
3. Recovery is not linear. Every day will not necessarily be better than the last. Detox/withdrawal/recovery is a marathon and it's likely that a few days here and there will be seem terrible. But each week will see vast improvement and it's worth it just to see how each new week feels on the body

Thanks for listening and I hope everyone has a wonderful day. Stay strong!"

144,1,"Hi, everyone!

I am a graduate student researcher conducting a study on attitudes related to using opioid drugs. The study is specifically looking at ways to discourage people from abusing/misusing opiates. My goal with doing this is to help as many people as I can. The opioid epidemic has been ongoing for nearly thirty years and has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

I'm looking to recruit participants for the study and wanted to post a link to the survey here for anyone who was willing or wanting to take it. Your participation is completely voluntary and you may choose to skip any questions you don't feel comfortable answering or stop taking the study at any point in time. In total, the survey should only take 5-10 minutes of your time.

Here is the link to the survey: https://purdue.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4N2Ghz1wBKCEggB

If you have questions, please reply to this thread or send me a DM. I will try to answer any questions as quickly as I can! Thank you very much in advance to anyone willing to participate!"

I‚Äôm listening to music now and the day is going by quite fast, it‚Äôs 7pm and in two days it‚Äôll be one week already. I can‚Äôt wait to hit 2 weeks and then a month after that.

The downside is this quarantine is exacerbating my moodiness I think, I‚Äôm already down mentally from the withdrawal and staying stuck inside doesn‚Äôt help. I went shopping today because my family needed some stuff so I got to stretch my legs a bit.

I try not to leave because I fear that my parents will get infected if I am, don‚Äôt care much for my own well-being but I would kill for them.

I‚Äôve downloaded a couple movies to watch tonight to make time go by faster, and hopefully a couple more tomorrow. I‚Äôll try to do something productive on Sunday if my body and mind let me.

Thanks for answering to my previous posts, I appreciate you all. To those who are struggling (from COVID-19, withdrawal or for whatever reason).... this shitty life is out to get us all and we need to fight to survive.

Have a good remainder of the day and please stay safe."
146,1,"Which prescription meds work well for RLS, restless legs"
148,1,"And it's not all sunshine and roses. For those of you just getting clean, I'm going to be very real with you: in my experience, sobriety is going to suck. For a while. Especially if you had a long habit. I had been on and off opiates since the oxy epidemic, but on various drugs for more than half my life. Learning to deal with sobriety is *not fun.* 

That said, the real payoff for me hasn't really been my own happiness, but that of those around me. People like being around me more now, and my family isn't constantly worrying that I'm going to die. 

Here's what's gotten me through:

\-No MAT. I tried Suboxone for a year in the past and it just made me feel bad being stuck on a substance every day. I don't really believe it allows your brain chemistry to recover properly until you're actually off of it. **Note: this is what worked for me, not you. If suboxone keeps you from killing yourself shooting fentanyl, I support it 110%!!**

\-As close to 100% sobriety as possible, with a few caveats. First off: I find things like caffeine and nicotine to actually be harmful to the process. They're really both crutches and while I'm back on the coffee train right now, I find it to be a step back in how I feel every day. Second caveat: psychedelics. **Again, this is my personal experience**. I find microdosing psilocybin with the occasional macrodose helps me a lot. It gives me perspective on what I find important and just helps sort my head out. To be clear, however, I would never recommend anyone do any drug they've abused in the past. If you were someone who couldn't stop dropping acid every weekend, find a different way.

\-Daily meditation, yoga, workouts, cardio. Go to bed early, wake up early and do these things. I'm not saying to never make an exception, but I prioritize these things above anything else as much as possible. I'd rather sacrifice my social life than not do the things that keep me sober.

\-Detox and long term recovery program. I did a week detox and a 3 month program. I highly recommend it if you can. Just about everyone can - you have to put sobriety first though. Since you're essentially not good for anything when you're high, there's no ifs ands or buts about whether you can do it. That job is not an excuse. If there's an option for your kids short of foster care, they're not an excuse. 

\-NA/AA, etc - I did these for a while, when I was in my program. They were ok. I imagine some people would find them very helpful. **The most important part of their program: acknowledging a higher power, which is just a spiritual way of giving up control. Stop grasping. Stop clenching. Realize that regardless of what you do, your life is going in a direction that you may not be able to direct.** The only group that I would still attend is Refuge Recovery, when I can find a good group in my area.

\-Counseling. Find a good counselor you connect with that you can go to long term. I still go twice a month. He keeps me in check and makes sure I'm on the right track. I'm 100% honest with him.

I still get cravings. At least once a week, sometimes more. Sometimes they're intense, sometimes they're fleeting, sometimes they're nearly unbearable. They will pass. Life gets better every day. It's a sloooooow climb, but it will happen. 

Hang in there."
149,1,"Hey guys I was wondering if anyone had links to any evening and/or midnight online meetings?

 My area is on lockdown thanks to corona and all local meetings are cancelled"
150,1,"COVID was a blessing in disguise. Forced detox combined with the WILL to detox. Where I am, you can be arrested for being outdoors. 

Not gonna lie - started using bupe patches on day 4 (MAT)....so maybe that‚Äôs not sober to many. But it‚Äôs sober to ME, and it‚Äôs definitely better than finding excuses to go pharmacy hopping to ingest over 2k mg in codeine phosphate per day. 

Guys and girls - you can quit this shit - bupe or not. I was doing it with just clonidine and gaba. The bupe was just a lil blessing ;) 

Happy Saturday y‚Äôall."
151,1,"On March 18th I officially made 5 months sober. I have struggled with heroin and really anything I could stick In a needle starting around 16. I did pills before that but that is beside the point. I do go to meetings. But most importantly I have learned better ways to cope with my feelings. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie and say I never think about getting high. Because that wouldn‚Äôt be true. I can however tell you that it is a fleeting thought, but then I quickly remember all the pain that came along with the high. And I don‚Äôt want that for myself anymore. One thing that has worked for me is leaving my old life behind. Before my relapse in October, (I had 3 months before that) I didn‚Äôt stop hanging out with all of my friends that still use. And it‚Äôs very hard to say no if it‚Äôs right in front of my face. I just want to let everyone know that it is possible. You‚Äôve just gotta believe that you are worth recovery. I believe everyone is. I love you."
152,1,"(Long rant) Wish I could post the picture here, but my girlfriend has 3 AA chips and I have 2 NA keychains. I used to use the white 24 hr keychain daily because, well, I was getting high.

I only got the 30 day chip in rehab anyway. It didn't feel fake though. The first 3 rehabs I went too I was forced. I didn't give a shit. Getting high was who I was. I knew I'd be back and hung with the crowd that was court ordered and always talked about getting high. 

My last rehab, I was bad off. Homeless, jobless...I had nothing. I decided to go all in. The first week meetings were optional. I went to every one. I loved the program. Previously, I had never spoken. Now I was always speaking. But someone told me I was just a baby in sobriety and I should listen more and not focus on speaking. I took it to heart.

A lot of vets talk about there struggles nonchalantly because they have years under there belt. I talked about the raging fire of anger I felt that came from my deep seated fear. I wondered, who am I without drugs? What will I do? My whole life has to change, and it was scary as all hell. 

I'll admit. A woman distracted me from sobriety. She had lots of money, and whispered dreams of getting high in her beach house mansion if we escaped rehab. But I've lived this life. She was looking for anyone. I wasnt special. I distanced myself and eventually transferred to a long term facility from that detox center. 

It was amazing. I lived in the gym. The staff were mostly ex addicts and my best friends. Nearly everyone there was committed to getting clean. Those that were resistant were secluded or constantly lectured or given advice. 

I told people things that I never thought I'd share. In a meeting I talked about the time a dealer drove me and my friend at gunpoint to a bank. Thinks o thought didn't really impact me made me cried. I cried so much there. 

Upon release, I kept going to meetings. After only a week though I began drinking again. Smoking weed. You guys know the deal. I felt like a fraud, because I was one. I stopped going to meetings.

I've been clean from hard drugs for almost 5 months, and I still keep the chips. We have to keep stiving to be better. I can be clean. I cam stay clean for a week or two at a time. But addiction isn't always physical. It's the mental side that I've been battling. The chips are a reminder that I have to keep fighting.

On a side note, I've struggled recently with even more abstract concepts that come along with addiction. I have guns, bulletproof vests, I'm paranoid... it really is a lifestyle. I'll never need this stuff I dont think. Bit at the same time it's hard to get rid of. Spending a good chunk of your life looking over your shoulder takes its toll. I work on boat docks, and still I have thoughts like ""this house has no cameras and all these boats, grills, ect....

I just want to move on. I sick of all the fear."
153,1,"I relapsed this month after 9 years off heroin. Shits not like it used to be. I overdosed. Twice. Scary shit.

165,1,"***Methadone withdrawal was the worst experience of my life.***  I thought I had found a solution for my addiction back in the 1990's.  Never again will I trot down that path.  With this said, I have kicked $200-500 a day heroin habit and was not comparable to the methadone kick.   I did not sleep for 20 something days, with the exception of dropping my head for minutes at a time due to complete exhaustion.   I have talked to other dopers who have experienced similar episodes due to kicking methadone.  For me, it is the same for all opiate withdrawal with a week or two of sweats, kicking the sheets, throwing up, and diarrhea.  But the sleeplessness that comes with the kicking methadone will take you to the edge of insanity like nothing I have experienced.   ***Does anyone else have the same experience?***  It is so much easier to be clean and sober.  I have to remind myself daily that there is no such thing as a ""casual or recreational heroin user.  I would really like a shot to take the edge off, but ""1 shot"" is a lie.  It is you are in the game out.  The middle does not exist.  I have not had a shot of dope since April 2, 2003, an for that I am grateful."
166,1,"After a really serious injury 2 years ago, I ended up getting really buried with pills on pain management, and been trying to pull myself out from under that. Before that I would periodically abuse if I had been prescribed them, taking more than prescribed  


I had a steady once a month prescription of Norco for the last year. As much as I'm in legit pain, I would also abuse and take more than prescribed, end up in withdrawals etc.  I got to a place where I just wanted to be off this crap. My last script 2 weeks ago, I picked them up from the pharmacy, kept about 20, tapered off and flushed the rest.  


Today I went back to my doc. To be completely honest, I was looking for more, trying to see if they could change the script to some extended release oxy or some crap. They said no, and piss tested me. There's no opiates in my system for the last 2 weeks, so it's going to look like I've been giving them away or something. Needless to say they'll deny my next refill.  


My addictive voice is throwing a big tantrum right now, but I'm ok with that. It's time to get off this train, it's already going far too fast and i've way too much to lose. I've a lot of shame, guilt right now in this moment, anxiety over the call that's coming from my doc (hey, you tested negative, wtf). Prob not helpful thoughts. This is better in the long run, and this too shall pass. I can deal with the physical pain from the injuries through more holistic methods.

168,1,"Hi everyone, I am an opiate addict who has struggled with addiction for around 8 years now and I've begun taking the steps, yet again, to get clean again. The problem I've had each time I get clean is that I don't commit to or even ever join any sort of treatment/counseling/therapy group(s)/programs. It's never been because I don't want to. It's actually all that I've ever wanted; however, it's never really been financially viable for me and the MAT clinics here don't offer any sort of worthwhile programs and all of the typical programs around here just aren't well suited for me (or really anyone younger (i'm 25)). Luckily, I was accepted onto a grant program for MAT treatment at my local clinic. But I need to take this further and actually start with counseling or therapy or something to do it right this time because enough is enough and I just want to do what's right once and for all.

So, long story short, I was hoping that some people here might know of any sort of online programs, whether it's drug counseling/therapy specific, even just broad therapy/psychiatry, outpatient, etc... I've always wanted to find an online option for things like this, especially now with the whole mess that our country and the world is in with covid... So yeah, please share with me any and all suggestions, experiences, resources, etc. for any sort of online treatment programs, apps, etc. that you might know about. It would be incredibly helpful and I'll be immensely grateful! 

  
Thank you so much for your time, your consideration, and your help."
169,1,"I go to BAART and they presented me with a 6 month bill of $1800. No warning or anything. I have been going for 8 years. 

I was able to get a month of take homes and have been tapering myself. I have dropped 5 mg a month since 60mg. I took home 28 15mg doses. I have been tapering myself so the last 5 days I have been down to 2.5mg roughly. 

My head feels like it's hot and I got the nasty Mudd butt. How bad has been your experience coming off methadone. 

I have gotten meds from the doctors. Honestly the only reason I was in methadone clinic was my doctor gave me naltrexone and I took it 5 days after doing methadone it was horrible. Both ends, ending up in the shower with Jean luc Picard and Jordi both coaching me to inhale the steam and hyperventilate so I could pass out and do it again. This scared me so bad I went and got into the clinic.

They aren‚Äôt doing extended takeaways or carries for anybody‚òπÔ∏èbut are taking the necessary hygienic precautions to be safe. Maybe because I was working in healthcare full time before, I am pretty much used to daily hygiene and sanitizing or washing my hands before and after most things I do anyways. But oh man, is the world changing quick everyday.. If anything.. I think now, more than ever, is the time we need to be supportive  and help one another-not turn against one another!

But yeah I suffered and struggled with my opiate addiction for almost a year before getting help in NA. Working towards getting into my rehab in Toronto now. My rehab center luckily is still taking admissions but have strict rules about no visitors and about cleanliness and respiratory hand hygiene care for all residents and staff and taken numerous precautions to keep everyone safe and prevent any transmission into the facility. They‚Äôve even substituted their preplanned outings for the residents with virtual reality exposure therapy and group therapy is in the biggest gymnasium possible with chairs all spread out etc. So I‚Äôm very impressed! 

Problem is that even though my out of province funds for the 7 weeks of rehab have been approved there, I still need to wait for the ministry of health of Toronto to finalise it all and then there is the issue, will I be allowed on the plane to fly there, from Vancouver BC, Canada.. anyhow all my upcoming doctor visits have been put on hold for now, my treatment at my rehab, a lot of meetings have been stopped, and other appointments for therapy including my physio and acupuncture and cupping (to help with my quite painful and daily aches and pains I get as a side effect from my methadone-I may be a rapid metaboliser!) have all temporarily shut down and yeah I know, not the end of the world but still sucks.. also many other things have been put on hold now for me but that‚Äôs my blurb for now. There‚Äôs others who are in less fortunate circumstances and although I‚Äôd love to be able to help those individuals I can‚Äôt, so.. 

Trying to stay positive and grateful for the things I do have and the change I can make-by focusing on my mental health and calling and supporting friends in NA. Ultimately, am now taking time to cherish the little things-taking time to make all my meals homemade, journaling, working on my organization, making my speciality coffee with my nespresso machine and reading!

I didn‚Äôt want to do the methadone thing again due to how it ended for me last time. So they put me on morphine. I‚Äôm supposed to taper down from there and transition to the suboxone. Has anyone had experience with this before? If so how did it work out? I‚Äôm afraid to even take anything right now. By best friend of 25 years died today from an overdose. Part of me just wants to suffer through this. I want to be successful though and not relapse due to the pain of withdrawals. Any help or advice is much appreciated"
176,1,"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this, maybe just looking for some people to talk me off the ledge. When a bed becomes available, I‚Äôm going to check into detox. I am so scared. I don‚Äôt know how I am going to get through this. My drug has been fentanyl and my tolerance has ballooned. About a bundle a day. I can feel withdrawal starting in as little as 2-3 hours, but I‚Äôll have to wait at least 24 to take my first sub. That‚Äôs just the facilities rules. My own experience says that I should be waiting 48-72 hours at least to avoid precipitated withdrawal because of fents high receptor affinity. They give you clonidine and robaxin, but that isn‚Äôt going to help. I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm thinking a bullet to my head would be better then what I‚Äôm about to go through. I can‚Äôt believe I did this to myself."
177,1,"Hey all I‚Äôm 688 days clean here. Currently living with my brother while I pursue a new job. We‚Äôre under quarantine as everything is shutting down and we don‚Äôt want to be stupid. 

This time has been rough on me and my anxiety. If I even think about Corvid-19 I start thinking I have symptoms.  I spent most of the day today shut in my room and just chilling and trying not to have a full blown panic attack. If the pandemic wasn‚Äôt enough I have a high profile interview via Skype tomorrow that has me more than a little nervous. It‚Äôs a big boy job that can lead to making real money and a real career and I‚Äôm scared to death of fucking it up. I had a panel interview last Friday that I was sure I did horrible at, so when I got the call for this upcoming interview I broke down and cried in the grocery store. 

Other than that I‚Äôve been reading, gaming on my Xbox, drawing, walking the neighborhood (with social distancing), bathing, and switching pajamas. That‚Äôs pretty much it. I‚Äôm taking a couple prescriptions for my anxiety and taking my Suboxone for cravings and just trying to make it through this one day at a time. As I like to say it‚Äôs far from the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. That title goes to breaking a 20+ year cycle of addiction. If I can do that I can do this."
178,1,"Just having one of those days where I‚Äôm really fuckin struggling. I hear people say all the time that they just ride out cravings and that they get less intense over time but I‚Äôm 9 1/2 months in and this shit is still so fucking hard. Like today I caught myself in DEEP on the DW looking for dope, it was like snapping out of a daydream realizing what I was doing. It‚Äôs just so soul crushing feeling so fucking alone all of the time, especially in crowded rooms. I just feel empty. Like I don‚Äôt even know how to have real emotions anymore besides profoundly negative ones. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about being alive, so what‚Äôs the point in giving a fuck about staying clean? Everything is so monotonous and I know how pathetically whiny this whole post sounds but I am just having a decade-long bout of existential dread and I don‚Äôt want to do any of this anymore and needed to send this out into the void"
179,1,"So I am 101 days sober today and staying in a sober living house that includes a required IOP program with residency. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the center our groups are held at have been closed down unril further notice. It's also becoming ridiculously difficult to find meetings around the area that are still going on. I know online meetings are still an option but I'm still trying to think of other things to do in order to enrich my spiritual life that are possible with this crisis going on and was wondering if any fellow friends of Bill had any ideas."
180,1,"I am worried that if we go on a 2 week shutdown how will I get my next weeks script? Will I have no choice but to withdrawl? Is the government even considering this? I feel worse for the daily methadone patients, how will they survive? With most at my clinic being homeless as well as on methadone. This seems like a serious issue that needs to be addressed or maybe it has and I  wasn't aware of it. I also read, if you take suboxone the Covid-19 will cause worse respiratory symptoms than if you do not. Any comments or links to articles referring to this situation?"
181,1,"Made it to Day 50. Seems more like six months since the days go by so slow. Most of the withdrawal symptoms are gone except for being lethargic some days an occasionally a little anxiety. But not taking any meds for comfort. Going to gym every day helped so much. Have had a few ‚ÄòI can take one pill for pain‚Äô days but just remembered how I felt that first week and it went away. Had many mental days where you can‚Äôt stop thinking about things from the past. Those are basically gone. 
The biggest obstacle now is this lockdown for Coronavirus. Can‚Äôt go to gym, can‚Äôt watch sports (my best diversion through this ordeal), can go out to eat. It can get kind of depressing. But this will pass!
So many people have helped me through this first phase and I thank you. I really wondered if I‚Äôd be able to do it because my back condition (lumbar fusion, 3 disk replacements, stenosis) is so bad that the pain can really affect the quality of life. But after 50 days with no opiates I can say the pain is no different then when I was gobbling down pain pills. It‚Äôs still bad but manageable. The big difference is that my head is clear now. My thinking is so much better and I know it will continue to improve as the brain rehabilitates. 
If I can do this you can too! A 13-year run taking 4-5 Norco EVERY SINGLE DAY! Seriously never missed ONE day. Was just a way of life. When you get to the point when you know you need to quit it‚Äôs scary. No one wants to go through intense withdrawals, especially while working.
Take a week vacation or week off from work. Get the comfort meds in advance and go for it. It‚Äôs brutal but knowing it‚Äôs temporary is the light at end of tunnel. My biggest fear was wondering if I‚Äôd ever feel good again without pain pills after taking them for so long. And I do! Actually even better and it‚Äôs only been 50 days. 
It‚Äôs hard for people (family, friends etc) who haven‚Äôt gone thru this to really understand what it‚Äôs like. You can tell them and they can see the suffering through withdrawals, but they just don‚Äôt get the full scope of whats going on. So you got to find it within yourself and lean on people who have been through the mental and physical WD‚Äôs."
182,1,"so i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôm in the right place. after googling I think maybe. my SO has been nodding out. Monday he was sitting upright and his eyes shut I had to say his name to wake him up. then i‚Äôm washing dishes he‚Äôs on the couch and it happens again. he is usually sleepy so I took it as not a lot of sleep. then yesterday we‚Äôre in the car, he‚Äôs driving. we started going into the wrong lane and he didn‚Äôt know what I was freaking out about. his eyes kept closing and he appeared to be nodding off. i kept worrying we were going to get into a crash. he also was saying stuff that didn‚Äôt make sense. like he forgot where it was that we were going several times. when we pulled over he started to eat his lunch and was again nodding off. at one point he swore he saw someone and was trying to show me but there wasn‚Äôt anyone. again today this morning he is nodding off. eating food it‚Äôs hanging out of his mouth that‚Äôs how bad he‚Äôs nodding out. we‚Äôre currently going through a rough patch and he says he‚Äôs disoriented from lack of sleep because of our fight. I don‚Äôt want to say anything and offend him if i‚Äôm totally in the wrong. but i‚Äôm worried about him someone anyone please let me know what you think is going on. is he taking something?"
183,1,"I celebrated 6 months yesterday and I know thoughts wont ever go away permanently and thoughts are normal and everything but my job is so frustrating. Like I'm not powerless anymore, I can look for a new job but wont be able to get one til this virus is done being a epidemic. I get to work from home but like they just added more shit and I was like I need to get fucking high.  When we first started working from home my first thought was ohh that's cool if I still got high I could just get high at my desk, but I shoved that thought away.
 I'm on vivitrol so I cant even get high right now and that knowledge is definitely saving me right now. I also have a good support system and I have some good praying habits in my life.
I just needed to tell on myself about how fucked up my thoughts have been today.
I'll hit an online meeting and listen to a speaker tape and hopefully I'll get through today. My next vivitrol shot is in a week and a half too so I'm grateful for that.
Thanks for letting me ramble."
184,1,"Irony can bring attention to a situation. I find it ironic how the nation dealt with, heck allowed, the opioid crises to unfold. How greedy we are as a nation when it comes to consumables even toilet paper. We have no internal care for everyday citizens of America any longer, not that I have ever truly experienced it before.

The machine that was my scholarly upbringing was streamlined to create direct servants of the state. New doctors, lawyers, nurses and scientists to help solve all the world's problems. We were meant to compete against each other with possessions so burdensome that one must spend the entirety of their life at work.

Then came the insurance policy to recoup funds, dim minds, and punish those that weren't doing their capitalistic duty to the fullest. The pharmaceutical companies that were truly languishing needed a guaranteed sell and the overpaid doctors needed something to keep patients in the offices. Opioids and anti-depressants were born of this situation.

How could a nation be truly happy when the entire family unit was disbanded. Men were told they needed to work their entire lives for a home and truck. Women were told the weren't needed in the household and needed to enter the workforce and quit caring for their children. Children were being bred up for the sole purpose of serving a broken state.

This opioid crises in comparison to this virus engulfs the death toll. Just take a look at this chart of America's opioid deaths  [https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) . The people in power flirted with the idea of a middle class and then looked for a complete and sweeping way to gut it when they realized it was unsustainable. Their favorite choice of drugs impeded hormone production and the natural urge to reproduce many different types including opioids.

Now that the market is all tumbling down, although it wasn't a strong one to begin with due to China's extreme power over manufacturing and debt, they are trying to bait us back in with zero interest debt and free money. I feel like I'm at a fucking circus.

They didn't care when they extended you that line of credit for that car/house/credit card that you would fail to pay. They didn't care when they knew you couldn't make the payments. They most certainly didn't care when China was flooding our streets with deadly fentanyl killing our peers. They don't care now."
185,1,"Got 14 days today off the dope! With the help of 2 sub strips and weed the withdrawals weren‚Äôt too bad. I‚Äôve been off the subs for 4 days now. Still smoking weed,
don‚Äôt think I need to be fully sober right now. Feeling good tho, I‚Äôm really happy to have these 14 days not doing H. I relapsed after being clean for two years about 2-3 months ago and just can‚Äôt seem to drop it completely again. This 14 days will have been the longest I‚Äôve stopped since my relapse. So I‚Äôm proud of that"
186,1,So basically I was on day two of opiate detox yesterday and found 20 of the 30mg codeine with 500 paracetamol in. I took 10 at midnight last night and ten this morning at 10am. I'm 17stone and used to hard drugs but should I be worried about that much paracetamol in my system?
187,1,"First off, mad respect and gratitude to the community for having my back. It really helped. I value this forum so much. How beautiful is it that this rare demographic of people suffering a particular problem can all get together to encourage each other and share advice! Even once I get clean long term I intend to frequent here to offer anything I can if I feel I could be of service :)  


ANYWAY. Thank you everyone who wrote back to my last post. Legends! I found great encouragement and advice and it means the world to me. It's made me convinced that this is a forum that is very beneficial to us all. &lt;3  


Got some good news and some bad news. Bad news is I picked up on day 6. Good news is for the first time in my life(which is kind of weird I haven't before) I dropped the spoon and the liquid became unattainable. I ended up having only 10mg of morph. Which is obviously nothing and I didn't even notice it. At first I was devastated. but now I feel like it's the biggest stroke of luck I've had in a long time! I highly doubt that miniscule amount will noticeably affect my withdrawal for I didn't stop withdrawing for a second. My weakness and stupidity was saved by a most fortuitous occurrence.   


 Then, to further increase my chances of success, a friend came and gave me a very decent amount of benzos to help me through the rest of withdrawal.  


Despite loving humans and all other beings, For a long time now I am often focusing on how much negativity we bring into this world. Maybe that's because I'm a semi-depressed addict who is focused on his own problems, but after reading/writing on this forum for the past few days and my friend helping me out of the blue it's a true pleasure to return to noticing the beauty of humanity.  


I've got a long way to go. I know that. But I'm not craving anymore. And I'm so glad I failed to lapse!!!!  
A few of you wonderful folk literally stopped me from lapsing the past few days. That's just so fucking amazing and beautiful. I cannot wait to return to the position to do the same for someone else.  


I'm rambling. I've had a lot of benzos. The intention behind this post is basically to express my gratitude and just share the story of my lucky slip of the spoon. Obviously at the time I was like ""FUUUUCK!"" but after a minute or two I just smiled and felt so lucky.  


I hope you're all feeling well and if not I hope you are sticking through the hard shit. I know you know it, we all do, but it passes. Everything does. Good times and bad. Impermanence is one of the only objective truths about reality as far as this eccentric man can garner.  


Thanks again for the beautiful welcome into this community. Without it I'd likely not have developed a positive enough view of it to continue. But am so glad I have!!!  


My one question - Do you think that extremely miniscule amount of morph (roughly 10mg IV when I'm used to either decent doses of smack or 180mg morph) after 6 days clean will have a noticeable effect on my withdrawal or do you think I'll get off scott free? I'm thinking I'll be fine but just curious what you guys think?

&lt;3"
188,1,I am 5 days in detoxing at home from heroin and coke here and there. I don't shoot it and although the symptoms have been minimal I cant fucking sleep for anything. I've tried melatonin.... advice???
189,1,Is there any kind of plan out there that anyone knows of that I can get coverage without the 30+ day waiting period for coverage??? I need to go get help like tomorrow.
190,1,"Throwaway as family and friends know my normal username. So here I am again. After 2 and a half years clean of a 6 year suboxone addiction and a many year before that pill and heroin addiction. I swore I would never be in this in position again. Then a couple months ago I got hurt and ended up having surgery and thought I was strong enough now to just take them as I needed them. Yeah, that obviously didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm not taking large amounts, and I‚Äôm avoiding needles (so far), taking maybe less than 20mgs of oxycodone a day or 30mgs of morphine a day and it‚Äôs been much lower amounts this week. That‚Äôs no where near where I use to be, maybe 1/10th of how I used to be, and I guess this is definitely not a horrible detox (so far)compared to how I know it can be. I took the very tiny last little piece I had this morning and it‚Äôs now the middle of the night. I can‚Äôt sleep and my legs hurt which are the two things that drive me the most crazy. I‚Äôm out of work since this weekend bc my state is basically locked down bc of Coronavirus and I have no money to buy any comfort meds. I have benedryl, but I swear that always makes the restless legs worse for me. I thought about maybe entering a sub program again but that would take weeks to even get an appointment and I don‚Äôt know if I want to open that can of worms again. Subs were so hard for me to detox from and took months before I felt even kinda normal. I‚Äôm just so furious with myself. I really thought this was all behind me.  Sorry if this sounds like I‚Äôm rambling. I‚Äôm sooo tired, emotional and my thoughts are all over the place. I hate feeling like this."
191,1,"50 days clean today, stuck in quarantine till the end of March at least, work completely cut my hours as of today so now I‚Äôm stuck at home with family that I do not get along with and stressing about bills. I just want to relapse so bad. I keep thinking about how to get heroin or even drink, which would be bad considering the meds I‚Äôm on. I don‚Äôt know how to keep distracting myself."
192,1,"I was in rehab for the second time, and relapsed the day I got kicked out a couple months ago (I let my emotions &amp; impulse get a hold of me). Since then, i‚Äôve been using multiple times a week, but not daily like I used to. And it‚Äôs always spread out, so I don‚Äôt have much of a physical withdrawal besides some insomnia, restless legs, and headaches. 

But the mental withdrawals and the cravings are insane! I don‚Äôt have any suboxone left because I stupidly stopped seeing my psych when I relapsed because my brain just pushed the idea into my brain ‚Äúyou relapsed, there‚Äôs no going back‚Äù

Well, I‚Äôm in the middle of looking at some more rehabs (I can‚Äôt imagine how embarrassing it would be to show up to the same rehab for a third time, all times within 3 months of each other. And I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôd take me back if they kicked me out of their IOP program for a dumb decision I made) and I can‚Äôt seem to gain the nerve to call my psych or the one who helped me while inpatient. 

Not sure if I‚Äôm complaining or asking for advice about what to do in the mean time, but hell, I‚Äôll take any advice you guys can give. How do you guys help the cravings you get without subs?! I don‚Äôt know how to distract myself well enough! I‚Äôm trying not to go out of my way to find money somehow to buy and use, but the cravings are killing me and I‚Äôm at that stage where I feel like I cannot be without fent right now. I feel emotionless and crazy depressed at the same time."
193,1,"I'm a very petite person so usually any substance would be peed out, We I went to a sub dr he said pee I was in ok. So I peed and while tested it I was talking to dr and right off the bat offer  24mg of buprenorphine I was like thanks:) So the test comes back the nurse gave me a weird look and whispers to dr. He says um what do you take again?? Just kratom dr he says ok baffles. Tests showed dextroamphetamine methadone Tramadol research chemical called diclazepam and some kind of antidepressant. I like what the fuc!? He said yes look go come back next week  go pick up your strips. So of course I did repeat again so I peed showed up for morphine and also hydrocodone? I stopped the Kratom that I was using and it still has some kind of weird s*** in it I haven't taken any real opioid since last year. I get one more chance I hope I don't pee some f****** weird s*** please I need advice get back PS sorry about my text to speech"
194,1,"Hello everyone, Day 13. 

So, I am feeling better today, although I still have fatigue and a kind of middle of the road mood. 

I don't feel depressed, but I don't feel happy either. And when I watch comedy shows that normally have me laughing, I just feel... ""eh"" 

So, I looked into protracted withdrawals, to give myself an idea of what to expect. I watched a video by this addiction doctor -- and basically it confirmed what I had been suspecting. 

This is a race, a long distance one. 

I wanted it to be a sprint. I wanted to feel great and wonderful a few weeks in... but the reality is, my body's systems are being rebuilt. 

My brain is being rewired. My hormone systems geared up again. Everything from the ground up, is being worked on. 

So, I think I have more of an idea of what I'm dealing with now. 

I just want to encourage anyone in Protracted Withdrawals to think of it long term. Think of things you can do for your body, and do them. Your body is doing its job. 

Today, it was sunny. I got some sun. I'm going to do laundry, and some exercise right now. 

I wish everyone the best. 

-Honey"
195,1,"So far I‚Äôve only got the fatigue, anxiety and suicidal ideation... On top of the general feeling like shit and wanting to jump out of my body, also no appetite whatsoever yet...

I took some benzos to help me sleep. I have some phenibut at home, and ketamine which I never use. Also some bud... My tolerance to the latter is pretty high though.

What should I expect tomorrow? I guess the diarrhea and other GI issues will hit plus I‚Äôll get crazy RLS. I‚Äôve been using for about a week-10 days straight, at night only, and I know from past experience it is making me withdraw.

Pray that I don‚Äôt do anything retarded. The day went by so slow... But at least it‚Äôs night now, and it seems like I‚Äôll be able to sleep...

Good night"
196,1,"Hey Guys, I finally made the move to stop with the blues last week and can't wait for this to end. I've been doing about 8-9 30's a day (so 240-270 mgs) for the last year and half. Tried to stop multiple times, would get off them with subs for 3-6 days but always resulted to going back. Convinced myself every time that I can get high one last time and then actually be done, of course it never worked out like that. 

Started off with Perc 10s back in 2017 with a few friends to feel good. Went back upstate to school and moved up to 15's , 20's , etc. It wasn't until I graduated college and started making real money that the problem became clear. To make things worse I started dating this amazing girl and got her on them about year ago. For the last 14 months I've been spending $10k/mo on these fucking pills. At first I wanted to quit because of the money, but it has gone far beyond that.

Finally took a stand last Monday and have been doing around 4mg of subs/day since then. Most of the severe withdrawals have passed but I still find myself extremely unmotivated, fatigued, can't sleep, etc. I'm in sales so my whole job is calling people all day and I can't seem to pick up the phone. I want to make sure I don't become dependent on the subs now, so I'm not sure if I should continue taking them even though I feel like shit. Had some people tell me the withdrawals from subs aren't bad and others who say they're worse than opiates.

Really appreciate everything you guys are doing in this group. I just wanted to hear from others who have been through this and can give another perspective on when it will finally end."
197,1,"Between work, family, and this covid craziness I'm feeling pulled in every direction, but I think it's good for me as far as distracting me from cravings! Energy, motivation, and my awful mood are the only things still bothering me, just taking it 1 day at a time."
198,1,I've been using oxy and then pressed 30s and heroin for about a year now. I'm down to doing 1 maybe 2 pressed pills a day. And I got my hands on one 8mg strip of suboxone. How should I go about dosing the sub and gettin off everything for good. Acutes have always just kicked my ass and I cannot miss work so  any advice is welcomed.
200,1,"*Guys, I*'m stuck in a particular position and I need help. Any input or comments would be appreciated. 

Basically I need to find a rehab that will help me maintain my dose of methadone, taper me off benzos, and then either start to taper me down on methadone, or just help me get off the benzos so that I can just taper off on my own when I get out. 

The benzos are raising my anxiety I believe, and preventing me from reaching stabilization on methadone. 

So far I have found two treatment facilities that would be willing to do this as long as my clinic faxes them my last 30 days of treatment documentation. 

My main focus is to get off benzos right now, and then go from there. I don't know if I want to continue taking methadone, because of the side effects, and well long term we all know it's not true sobriety and hell to get off of. 

Ideally I would be able to find a long term detox like 90 days that would taper me off both.

The two I found so far are:

*Recovery Centers of America. 10 day benzo detox, and continue 30-40 days after for treatment (require fax of 30 days treatment from methadone clinic to continue MAT medication)*

*Good Samaritan Hospital. 10 day benzo detox, and continue MAT. (only needs phone call documentation)* 

If you guys know of any way I can taper of Benzos, though an inpatient rehab you know of that would help maintain my MAT please comment or let me know. I've found several other rehabs that said they would take me and get me off everything in 7-10 days, and I just don't know how the hell that's possible. All they will do is just make me wait 72 hours, and then do a Subutex taper. Which leaves me feeling good the last day, and then two days later I get hit with crippling PAWS or whatever. 

Please help me any advice is appreciated."
201,1,"I recently did a video about Safe Injection Sites. It is quite surprising to me just how varied each city is, and how there are so many perspectives on this issue.

203,1,"I've been on subs since 2005. Over the last year I have slowly tapered from 16 mg to 1mg. I'm almost completely out and I feel pretty awful, albeit not as bad as when I have tried to jump from higher doses. 

1mg, or even just .5mg makes me feel pretty good, which tells me I have made some worthwhile progress as I consider those to be basically a threshold dose in myself. I can also take a couple grams of kratom and truly FEEL them, which tells me I have some receptors still available to occupy. This, honestly, is strange territory for me.

I'm not sleeping well at all, although I am getting about 6 hours. This is in contrast to earlier attempts to jump from higher doses where I would only get one or two hours. So again, I can see some progress.

But my inner impatient addict voice wants to know when I will start feeling 100 percent? I'm about to cut my dose in half, or skip days, and due to supply issues I will be completely dry soon after that. Although I'm disabled and work isn't an issue, I still value my fully functioning time very much! To be honest, if this is going to be a long fight I'm not sure I will make it.

For some reason on sunday i convinced my self i could just use for a few days, no one would know and id go back to normal after. Monday i went to work and oded in my van. Woke up in the ambulance when they narcanned me. Cop showed up to the hospital and informed i was being charged for possession. Then went back to work to grab my stuff and was told to clean out my van. Its alot to process right now but i think im in a place where ive just accepted what happened and just have to start over.

And then on day 7, off methadone (yesterday) I was awkward being interviewed on Real Talk Recovery‚Äôs youtube.

Check out her channel, she has nightly( MARA ?) meetings. She is much better at the whole recovery talk / channel than me. (I don‚Äôt consider myself a recovery channel or youtuber, just someone who talks about that stuff sometimes.)

[One week off methadone interview  !](https://youtu.be/t9Tqr9Tzvg4) link.

Anyway, if someone wants to get off methadone, they totally can. But pleas, it isn‚Äôt a rush, it isn‚Äôt a race. There is nothing morally wrong with being on methadone. I largely got off it to show people on the internet it can be done, as it seemed helpful...and I know I‚Äôm not at risk of using dope now. (Very thankful for internet friends giving the support and inspiration to even care to get off.)

Note - I am fairly young, at 30, and in a comfortable home situation now, with no underlying health conditions, so will be up front I have some advantages others may not, in terms of tapering off.

But please, if you have any urge to use opiates still, or aren‚Äôt in a happy place, don‚Äôt get off methadone too early.
Can mean the difference between life and death for ya.

207,1,"I love my hubby with every ounce of my being...we have been together 23 years and I can honestly say these last 64 days of him getting sober have been the toughest. Dont get me wrong, I'm no where near close to throwing in the towel cause I know in my heart that if he doesnt stay sober I will end up planning his funeral.  We have 3 amazing kids and a beautiful grandbaby for him to live for. Our 3 kids are teenagers and are terrified of losing their dad..and I keep telling them to pray.  My hubby decided to get clean after long time on his own.  Some days are GREAT then we have the days where he is verbally downright cruel. I've never been addicted to drugs so I have no clue what he is going thru...only what I read on here and the internet. I know when his mental state gets bad and he says he hates us and it's our fault he did drugs and this is what we asked for since wanting him sober..I know in my heart this isn't the real him..he wouldn't say these horrible cruel things to us. I tried to get him to get sober in past but I learned til he wanted it wasnt going to happen and this time he said he was ready. I talk to the kids and tell them please try to understand that your dad is going thru a living hell right now but in the end it will be worth it. The last couple days have been back to being bad and he says he is going to go back to the drugs today no matter what. I'm so terrified and no idea what to say or do to try and help him cause when he is in this state it seems no matter how I try to help it sets him off even more. He is sleeping now while I'm writing this and I'm hoping the ""dope sick"" and craving he is having will pass when he gets up later. Please any advice on how I can help him..right things to say or do..I'd really appreciate it cause I'm at a loss. I love my hubby with every breath I take and I refuse to give up on him and lose him in this battle."
209,1,"Some of you might know me from my post about counselling and waiting on Suboxone. In the meantime I have been told to just keep doing the same old thing.

Well last week I felt like complete shit from Monday until Thursday(re-up.) I wake up today and I'm barley feeling anything from withdrawal. 

I usually take between 10mg and 30mg hydromorphone continue(Diluadid) each day. I always keep some 2mg pills as back-up as sometimes that's enough to knock me slightly out of withdrawal enough to not be a miserable pos to my very-pregnant wife.

So, any ideas why sometimes withdrawal kicks in earlier, harder, sometimes easier,less bad, slower? And any idea why such a low dose as 2mg can be enough to help get me through the day? I mean 2mg compared to 10-30mg seems so....small."
210,1,"Hey guys, thanks for all your previous support - I am at day 21 off fentanyl and doing wayyyyy better than a week ago when I was posting about how depressed I was and how I hated everything lol. Absolutely insane how much a few days of finally sleeping can do to improve mindset and help ameliorate withdrawal symptoms. 

Tldr; I abused benzos for the first ~two weeks to cope with opiate withdrawal, and used Gabapentin in tandem at doses avg'ing 900mg the entire last three weeks of withdrawal. I feel I don't need my GABA crutch to get thru withdrawals as I am finally feeling stable and consistently normal. Although it might not be fun, would cold turkey off Gabapentin at these time periods/doses potentially give me seizures? 

More detail: I used to be hooked on benzos for years, so I figured I'd use my old favorite drug to get off my year long affair with fentanyl. Well, I ended up hating the way benzos made me feel because the inebriated state came with no euphoria like I was used to with opiates. Darn. And worse off, they didn't even help me sleep. Still, that didn't stop me from abusing all the bars I had to mask withdrawal pain over the first ~17 days (maybe a total of 7 times off and on using about 2-4mg Alprazolam each time). During this period I consumed a total of 20mg of Xanax, a real unfortunate bit for someone with no tolerance. All while being on 600-1200mg of Gabapentin a day, depending on how bad withdrawals were. These past three days I've taken no benzos but continued the 900mg of Gabapentin a day. I have been feeling amazing, mostly because I am happy the physical opiate withdrawals are finally subsiding. Today (day 21) I took 600mg Gabapentin and felt fine all day, just a few of the same old chills - but nothing like it was a few weeks ago. 

At this point, can I just stop taking the Gabapentin completely? A lot of people online say they can't even get off 100mg of Gabapentin a day lol. Seems kinda silly to me given what I just went through. I want to just up and quit so I don't have to deal with more GABAergic withdrawals setting in from a longer period of use (at least more so than the three weeks I've set myself up for). I can mentally tough out being uncomfortable, but should I be worried about seizures? 

Also, please guys, don't tell me I can't do it and that I'll be too uncomfortable. It seems nearly everyone in previous posts like to make a point to tell me that I need to go to rehab and that I can't fight opiate withdrawal given my high pattern of abuse. I understand your guy's concern cause withdrawals suck, but still, here I am three weeks later clean off the fent with no intention or craving to use any opiate. I don't want suboxone/kratom/rehab/etc or to be told I can't do something when I have support here and at home, and a mentality to quit. None of this shit ever feels good or is easy. Even though I might complain because I am a lil baby, I am confident in my ability to get sober (granted I can do it safely). I am determined to be off these damn support meds so I can be off everything by the end of the month.

If I should be worried about seizures, would my best option be 600mg over next week, then 300mg for a week and then nada? I'm worried by doing this I'll be adding two more weeks of GABA inhibition, thus exacerbating the GABA withdrawals by extending the period I am on them. What sounds more ideal to me is quitting now and suffering more intensely over a shorter period. Gonna ask my doctor next week, but I don't want to wait that long if it means extending my GABA usage by 25% longer if I don't have to...what do you guys think? 

As always, I appreciate your guys concerns and help. Venting here and hearing others experiences has made this process a lot more pleasant for me. So thank you if you made it this far. I know I have a tendency to write too much."
211,1,"I ask for the lurkers and because I have never been any angel myself. One has to quit or get on subs at the very least right now, am I wrong?"
212,1,"I done fucked myself again. Going on 36 hours without subs and honestly I‚Äôm not sure what to expect. 

I‚Äôve been through all this before but never with subs, only shorter acting opiates. I was using about 3-4mg sub for the past 6 months. For the first few months it was more like 1-2mg 2-3 times a week with kratom use between. Only the last 3 months has it been 4mg pretty much every day. I‚Äôm not prescribed I get them off a friend. 

I‚Äôm so done with the bullshit and I‚Äôm ready to get clean again. I just have no idea what to expect for withdrawals. I‚Äôm broke as fuck and all I have is about 20 grams of kratom left and I‚Äôm trying to do this low key. 

I guess I‚Äôm just posting this because you guys are a pretty cool sub and I find inspiration here. I need to tell someone what‚Äôs going on so that I‚Äôm held accountable. It‚Äôs worked for me in the past so I need to do it again"
213,1,"I know some people look down on others on subs. Im just looking fo some advice. I'm clean from IV dope/ice and have been on subs for about 6 months. Started off great, did what it was supposed to do, and it really helped with the cravings. Now, six months later, the cravings are starting to come back, and pretty strongly. I'm not sure if it's that 4-8 month mark where they get bad again, and you just need to push through and it will go away, or if there's something more. Should I up my sub dose? Half of the reason I'm on a maintenance med is because of the supposed alleviation of cravings. But now that's kind of fading away, and I'm not sure what to do. I can't keep this up if the cravings stay this strong. I'm having drug dreams almost every night."
214,1,"So god damn sick of this fuckin emotional rollercoaster. Thanks everyone who commented on any of my rambling ass posts. I am going to relapse, no doubt about it. My fuckin mental state can't be helped, I have tried, god damn it i tried but I'm so god damn suck of being a fucking prisoner in my own mind and body. No god damn energy, I have to go back to work I can't be off anymore. 64 days and it's been fuckin horrible. Hope the first dose fuckin kills me, damn sure gonna give it one hell of a shot."
215,1,"I've been on Suboxone for a little over a year and worked my way down to 2mg per day. I'm really struggling to take the final jump as the restless legs, anxiety and sleepless nights are pretty brutal when you have a young family.

I'll be honest- I've worked out that if I take 4mg, I get a nice little buzz. This obviously worries me.

I don't have great self discipline but I've been planning to AND want to be completely Suboxone free.

How do you suggest I go about coming off? Or, is now not the right time with everything that's happening in the world?

Thanks in advance."
216,1,"I am trying to speak with any women who have experience being on Suboxone during pregnancy. Specifically, anyone who was on a particularly high dose of 16MG like I am. 

I'm literally terrified. 

My suboxone doctor thinks it's perfectly fine to be on 16 MG throughout it all, but I also don't necessarily trust him to have patients best interest in mind. (only doctor who accepted my insurance so)

My OBGYN is going solely off what my sub doctor says as they have no experience with subs during pregnancy until me."
217,1,"I'm about 6 months pregnant. I take subutex and have been told not to stop taking it until after my baby is born as it can cause miscarriage to stop. But the requirement for the subutex program I'm in is group therapy meetings for an hour and a half, twice a week. The group has about 15 people in it, in a small room, in a close circle. I am very hesitant to go tomorrow due to coronavirus. Everyone is saying avoid public interaction as much as possible, but no one in my area takes it seriously, no precautionary measures are being taken. This virus could lead to me being hospitalized and possibly hurt my baby and me, but not attending meetings is considered not working towards treatment and complying. I'm not sure what to do?"
218,1,"Hey all. Day 12. 

So, I was sick the past few days, but now that I'm better I feel stuck inside my place. 

Work has been cancelled, which normally I would be relieved about... but I am getting cabin fever. Lots of anxiety from being inside. 

I need to get out... but it's raining and I can't even go for a pleasant walk! 

Gah! 

I hate the rain so much right now..."
220,1,"Hello, 

I saw an article saying that many addicts are at an increased risk of complications arising after contracting COVID-19. I realize that a large part of this is because of homelessness, lack of hygiene, lack of health care, weakened immune systems, etc. 

But my question is, since one of the biggest dangers of COVID-19 is respiratory issues, and since Suboxone/Methadone and other opiate-based medications cause respiratory depression, does that mean that current Suboxone/Methadone patients are also at a higher risk than others?

Thanks!"
221,1,"So, day one of h and morphine withdrawal today. Any help or home remedies you guys can suggest to make this shit easier would be awesome. Thanks guys stay strong"
222,1,"I had my wisdom teeth out this past weekend. I was 265 days clean when I went in for the procedure. They gave me a Valium to calm my nerves down, and it didn‚Äôt work too well but I survived. I was sitting in the chair when the doctor recommended a script for an antibiotic, as well as Tylenol-3.  I thought to myself ‚Äúgood, that shit is useless to me as an opioid...‚Äù I hate Tylenol 3, I always have. It was never enough, but I knew I needed it this time for real.  
  
I filled my prescription and immediately gave it to my girlfriend to dispense it appropriately to me. Which she did. After the first dose, about 8 hours after surgery, I felt it. I liked that I could feel it. You see, when I was just 35 days clean, I had to have my gall bladder out (I‚Äôve been a mess since starting the whole sober train. Ailments left and right, including a kidney stone as well. It‚Äôs been a rough 8 months) and they gave me 3 rounds of fentanyl and it wouldn‚Äôt even touch the pain, thanks to my tolerance at the time. So the fact that I could feel the codeine told me I had come back down to baseline at least some. 
  
Except there was one small problem - it wasn‚Äôt enough.  I wanted more. The familiarity of it came back, the feelings I had before when I would get Vicodin or Percocet and it would send me to the streets running to heroin as fast as I could get it, just to get higher. Nothing was ever enough, I would spend thousands of dollars just to get a legit legal script only to turn to H anyways. There was no way she was going to give it to me, and I didn‚Äôt want to let her down, or break any trust, so sneaking and was out of the question. I knew I didn‚Äôt want either of those things again anymore. The fact that I gave them to her and made her dispense them was a safety measure in and of itself. For me and for her/us. She‚Äôs smart, she‚Äôs tracking this for me because I told her all my secrets and sneaky ways. So I took what I needed, and now she still has the rest, and they‚Äôll be flushed or disposed of before I get back to her place. So essentially, I made it.  And I know better than to go hit the streets. 
  
267 days today. And still strong. Just be careful, and if you need them, have someone help you. I doubt I would‚Äôve been responsible with them had I had to manage it on my own. But I did make it."
223,1,"Quit my job and went cold turkey from a three month fent pressed m30 binge. Its been real rough, and I‚Äôve only been able to sleep maybe two hours every night so far. I think I got through the worst of the physical withdrawals though. I been eating clean, taking vitamins, taking baths, taking a bit of kratom during the worst of it, doing everything I can for a quick recovery. I can‚Äôt seem to shake the goosebumps or body aches though. :( Also the anxiety has been hell.  

But I‚Äôm so tired of being controlled by a drug and not to mention how much money I‚Äôve wasted on those pills. If anyone has some tips like foods I should eat or supplements to take or something to help with sleep please let me know!! I need all the help I can get."

225,1,At work. Ready for this microbiological warfare to rip through my organs
228,1,"Yo I hope you are all well :)  


I've been browsing this subreddit for a long time but only just joined and am making this post because I am day 4 of admittedly only mild-moderate withdrawal but am so close to picking up.  


I want to nearly as much as I don't want to. I fear the former desire is going to outgrow the latter.  


Just managed to leave the porcelain prison to head to the bottleshop and bought a few strong cans to hopefully take the edge off. I also fear that despite the edge being taken off, it will also reduce my inhibitions to a point that I'll fuck up!  


Fear seems to be the predominant force in my mind presently. I suppose that's the human condition's predominant force.  


I've been struggling with addiction for the majority of my life. A few years back I was nearly two years clean of everything and my life was proper juicy. Alas, I lapsed and here I am. I'm 29 and living with my mother again. Constantly switching between off my face or withdrawal. I reflected on how I got clean last time; a mixture of being fed up with the pain, some skillful psychedelic use, rehab, hope and determination.  
I've obviously tried all those things these past few years but unfortunately to no avail.  


I suppose the intention behind this post is to both vent and also to hopefully receive some encouragement or at least something that will help me ensure that I don't want to use more than I do!  


This is a good forum.   


Hope you're all doing better than I! I've got to go to the toilet lol"
229,1,"Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 1 full year off opiates, no cravings, got the car I always wanted, making more money, saving money, my baby nephews know their uncle now , I have a family who can actually trust me .. I‚Äôm still fixing minor things like my credit lol just happy I made it this far !!"
230,1,"I don't really have anyone to tell. My family and close friends never knew so I can't really tell them of this and they would freak if they knew. I just want someone to tell, I'm glad how my life has changed. I'm in school now and going in for a job interview this week."
231,1,"Last Tuesday I had my first telemedicine appointment with the detox psychiatrist. We agreed I would do my ‚Äòconversion‚Äô (stop taking oxy and wait 24 hours to start suboxone) last Friday; I took the day off at work and mentally tried to prepare. once I did the ‚Äòconversion‚Äô I was eligible to start group therapy. Well apparently his ‚Äòsystem wasn‚Äôt working‚Äô according to the patient coordinators I kept bugging, and he only sent in the scripts today. Clonidine, suboxone and zofran. Therefore, I missed the opportunity to feel like massive shit over the weekend and maybe, maybe be able to work tomorrow and pretend like none of this is happening. I was already super pissed about the whole situation and my supply is dwindling.        

So I get to CVS today at about 2:30 and they won‚Äôt let me have my prescriptions because the bitch pharmacist ‚Äòwent for lunch‚Äô and they need to ‚Äòconsult‚Äô before I start the meds. I have all the information sheets necessary for my ‚Äòconversion‚Äô from the detox clinic, I don‚Äôt need to talk to fucking CVS. This is humiliating enough. They wouldn‚Äôt even give me my thyroid meds that I‚Äôve been taking for the past 6 years or my fucking ibuprofen. Nope. Go fuck yourself and come back later when we feel like giving them to you. I can‚Äôt come back later because my husband needs the car to go pick up some stupid bookshelves at ikea 40 miles away and the pharmacy will be closed by the time he gets back.     

I‚Äôm really trying, guys. Last night I had a mental breakdown and was just screaming my head off in my bedroom. I can‚Äôt stand the constant pain anymore. I tried upping the gabapentin and it doesn‚Äôt work. I probably need a much higher dose but I‚Äôm terrified of becoming dependent on that as well, apparently it‚Äôs a bitch to wean off of. I was thinking of going to get detoxed at the hospital until surprise surprise, bitch psychiatrist decided to do his job and send in the scripts today. Now I have to figure out when I can go through with the conversion, and it probably won‚Äôt be until next Friday :-/ fuck fuck fuck"

244,1,"Tsup guys, really admire the sub.

I'm on day 7 of getting clean after about 6 years of on and off use. Most recent binge was about 6 months and it went as usual. From I have to stop using to why did I stop using again? Hate that shit. Anyway after many failed attempts of getting clean and bitching out at the 2 or 3 day mark, I am finally feeling like myself again. I can't tell you what did it this time other than like mortal concern for myself if this is the apocalypse. Cant really protect myself or loved one's if I'm shaking in bed. Idk im just happy. 

I guess all I can say to those currently or about to be in withdrawal is just prepare yourself as best as possible. Lots of fluids and lots of easy to make food. Just 5 days and you'll be okay. 2 more after that and you'll start to feel like you again.

God bless"
246,1,Hey guys ive been doing some h for almost a year now today is my first day! Hope you all tacle your own stuff and keep going on much strength and guts!
247,1,"Everytime i have applied for rehab i have discharged myself while i was at the detox facility, always some excuses about drama on the outside and the feeling of being locked up and my freedom taken away from me, doctors who doesn‚Äôt have the proper knowledge about detox and thus make the patients there suffer nearly cold turkey. Im going to rehab 1.april, one month of detox from 6mg subutex, however im planning on going down to 4mg before i go there. 

There are so many things i need to get fixed in my life, first and foremost is my debt, i have stacks of bills and not enough money to pay for it all. I have heard that if u go to rehab, the goverment will cover your rent for three months (this is in norway), that way i will be able to pay off some debt and eventually freeze it for one year and save up money for a deposit since im planning on moving to a better place after rehab, im also getting planning on getting a dog and hoping it doesnt take long until i get my disability benefit. Im going to try some new and exciting activities when i get clean which include yoga, meditation and traditional boxing. Im just stressed out since its not long till i have to go there. I don‚Äôt know what to do if i relapse again.. and i have come to the conclusion that i will not tell my grandmother that im leaving until i know i can pull this off, i dont want to dissapoint her with yet another relapse. Im planning on staying there for six months even though i can stay there for a whole year if i want to."
248,1,"So one of my biggest takeaways from my recovery so far is that rehab isn't for everyone, AND you're not doomed to screw up just because you've decided it isn't the right atmosphere for you to heal. I personally found that the really intensive schedule, while for some works really great and instills that sense of self through repetition, just did NOT suit my temperament. I could hear my body screaming at me to slow down and just be still and heal along a more natural timeline.  
The only things I regret missing out on are the therapy sessions I had only just begun working in. The facility I went to did CPT/CBT along with Schema therapy, which I undoubtedly need. But, so far I have no regrets for deciding to take myself out of an environment that wasn't working for me.  
Has anyone else opted out of rehab and went on to have a successful recovery? I'll be doing a lot of the leg work myself now, so any tips on creating my own support system would be wonderful. Oh, and I'm not a fan of the 12-steps for personal/spiritual reasons. The one NA meeting I went to left me with a really uncomfortable feeling, so that may not work for me. It could've just been that one group though. I'm open to try another. I'm open to anything!  
Tell me what you think. Tell me about your recovery, rehab and life after.  
Thank you :)"

She just broke down again yesterday after 3 days.  Her honesty is astounding, she always tells me the truth.  I know it's been a tough road.  Im sad for her and miss my old friend.  

Thanks in advance"
250,1,Had a relapse yesterday afyer 72 days off all drugs. How far do you think this will put me back as far as recovery goes? The relapse was not fun and obviously I regret it.
251,1,"I remember, when I was a kid, I was surprised how long it took me to get addicted. I was doing some pretty high quality heroin iv and several weeks in, I still was not physically dependent. 

Years later, I tried tapering down. What I failed to think about was the original time frame for my addiction. So I tried to taper quickly and it failed. I mean, like ten days.

Now I wonder, if I used the same time frame as my first experience with opiates, would that make the difference? I mean getting to the point where I am taking less than what would normally be considered a therapeutic dose? Say something like 3 mg. of oxy every 6 hours?

I will probably never find out because I think I am going to taper off with kratom and a little xanax. But I sort of think it would work."
252,1,"**I'm on suboxone 8mg daily for past 1 year 2 months**
Prior to that, I used heroin for approx. 3 years
Prior to that, I had my first bf, long-term relationship, 5 years ago we broke up due to bad circumstances and long-distance.

My problem is my sex drive, I'm beginning to think my sex drive is done and I'm asexual. I'm 24, straight white female. Don't like porn.

As time went by, I'm beginning to get concerned. I feel out of the place socially. I can't relate with anyone, I don't have a sex drive, I don't feel like having sex at all. I also don't feel like finding a new relationship. I didn't want to accept any new relationships. I turned down the relationships. I never had any a ""small"" spark of love for anyone new. I only felt romantic to my ex. Shits depressing."
253,1,"At the hospital about to watch my third child and first boy be born. What an incredible gift. Been a rough week, operating in 0 sleep at this moment. This will be the first child I have had where I was no on opiates. Life is good and getting better."
254,1,"Good morning, friends! I made it! This is the longest I've ever made it through wd! Honestly couldn't have done it without all of you! The outpouring of encouragement and support has been so great here I can't even keep up with the comments! (Sorry btw, busy busy yesterday, and in the process of getting all new furniture this weekend so I'll be super busy all weekend!) I'm sorry if I haven't responded your comment, I've def been reading them all though!&lt;3

So I woke up again last night after about 4 hours but I was able to fall back asleep so I actually got more than 3 hours for the first time on 10 days! Whew! I'm feeling a little unmotivated today, but just that fact that I could sleep should help me push through!

Currently waiting on my gf to get out of the shower so I can get in, and blast some music to get me up and moving! Were taking our daughter to see her grandparents today, then off to get our new furniture! 

Even just two weeks ago, I would've been here in bed, counting my suboxone, seeing how I could dose to stretch my high through the weekend, just to get my ass out of bed! Crazy that I'm just now realizing that the drugs that I thought I needed to get out of bed, were actually making me lazier and more unmotivated than I have ever been in my life! I've always been super high energy, always the hardest worker, but man the last 3-4 years I became a shell of myself. Staying high all day to make it through my work day, just to come hone and lay in bed all night. Sheesh wtf was I doing?!

It's a new day, and I'm optimistic about my new life! Once again, thank you for all the support and sorry if I haven't responded to you, I will try to get to everyone today between chores lol I love you all and have a great day!"
255,1,"In the spirit of recovery and the difficulties associated with it, I‚Äôm sharing a survey to be completed by anyone who is/is not yet sure whether they want to address their addiction. It‚Äôs meant to hopefully clarify one‚Äôs goals and steps that would be required.

257,1,"Fucking hate waking up in the morning and having to do the whole work thing, talk to people, and not being alone in my room or bed. I hate going to bed alone and waking up alone, no SO and no friends. It's just me and my dog. One good thing I thought about today was my blood line ends with me. I'm a single child with no kids and will NEVER have any. I would hate to bring a kid into this world being the worthelss POS I am. Fuck all that shit!!! Well I'm off to go asleep only to wake up to another shitty day but at least it's the weekend so I'm off and not on call!!"
258,1,"I've been in an opiate haze for the last 7 years. Waking up from this dream like state is like coming out of a coma; I've been sleeping for the last 7 years and only waking up now. I am 31 years old. I had an amazing career which I started early, great friends, great family, loving boyfriend. In the last 2 years of my addiction I've lost all of that. I am on the brink of being homeless, no friends, family is gone, lost my job, and my loving partner. How far does one have to sink into this coma in order to fully lose oneself? 

I've been sober for only a week now and through the worst of the withdrawals I find myself to be a completely different person. My kindness has turned completely off and my apathy towards everything and everyone is scary. I don't recognize myself. My question...from a psychological standpoint, will I gain my old personality back? Please pray for me."
259,1,"Hey guys, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Whether today is your first, or 10,000th day sober, you‚Äôre amazing, and you matter to this world.   
  
Today I am 265 days sober from opiates, cocaine, and alcohol addiction. To make it so this is not a novel, I will say I am still suffering from some relatively minor PAWS, including some physical side effects.  Some of which may be permanent. Most notably, sleep issues, and some weakness, coordination/balance issues.  
  
It‚Äôs pretty common knowledge that heroin, and other opiates can suppress the immune system. I for one can almost always count on a rash/hives, and a relatively severe cold sore outbreak both when I start using, and when I stop. These can go on for quite some time afterwards. My last outbreak was around the 6 month mark.  
  
I work in a large sales office. My company is required to allow me to work from home if my immune system is compromised, or otherwise leaves me vulnerable to COVID-19. So, I am here asking the community what your opinions are on that?  My work knows I had a substance abuse problem - they gave me 90 days off last year to get myself through rehab. They‚Äôre incredibly supportive. For that reason, I don‚Äôt want to take advantage of them, but I do want to protect myself in the event that I would be considered immunocompromised. Anyone have insight on that??   
   
Thanks!"
260,1,"Ok so heads up, this post is about what's going on in my life in relation to COVID-19. If you don't want to hear about it, I totally understand, here's your out. Take it.

I live very near to Richmond, Virginia. There are currently 30 presumptive positive cases in my state. We went into a state of emergency yesterday and quickly after that K-12 schools started closing for two weeks to start. Yesterday and today I made trips to get everything food-wise we may need, fresh stuff for at least a week and lots of cold/frozen foods and nonperishables. I made sure we had a normal amount of your normal on-hand cleaning supplies and soap. I'm not stocking up on toilet paper.

I have a middle-school-aged step kid who spends 50% of his time with us, the other half with his mom and step dad. He's with us this weekend. He's gonna be out of school for two weeks. He's so excited, and that's great, but I am worried that this isn't going to feel exciting fourteen days from now. His dad and I both have to keep going to work. His step dad works out of town and is currently gone for work, mom works from home. His mom suggested that because dad and I have to go to work, kiddo should stay with her where they can better practice social distancing. I totally get it. But that doesn't mean I won't miss that kid like crazy. 

It's all together been a REALLY stressful situation. Sure, maybe I'm being overly cautious. But you know what? I'd much rather play it safe and self-distance as much as possible and be okay, than end up getting sick - or being asymptomatic and getting someone else sick. Call me crazy. Regardless, I'm trying really hard to keep my anxiety in check. 

The last time I felt this intensely anxious for an extended period of time was my most recent relapse on heroin. It's fucking hard keeping deception up 24/7. I had to get money, pick up, get works, use, and keep the cycle going - and I had to hide it all from the people I live with and everybody else. It was work, lots of calculating and pre-planning and sneaking around. I hated it. It was awful. I don't ever want to do it again, and I try to remind myself of that anytime I get a thought about using being a possibility. 

With the real possibility of people in my community dying looming over my head, anxiety's never been higher besides my relapse. Which brings me to my point. I am *so fucking grateful* that I'm not using right now. That I don't have to hide using when I can't go anywhere but work and home. It makes life that much easier in this super crazy time. 

I just wanted to express that. Thanks for reading."

262,1,"Weird thought...

Not trying to offend anyone who's died/been sick/will get sick...but seems like this is an ironically good opportunity for anyone who has to stay home to get clean. I know I could never get clean while working. Plus staying home will help our potentially immunocompromised asses stay virus-free. I know forced recovery doesn't work, but seems better than jail.

I'm not sure how this will affect the street supply but I can't imagine it will help. Dealers might run out/I've heard in Italy they're forbidding people from going outside. Not trying to make anyone panic if they're gonna run out. But ive heard methadone clinics are staying open? For now? Maybe get to one if you're worried. 

Thoughts? So much misinformation and panic out there. Maybe I'm wrong."
263,1,"I was told many many times that i have addictive personality, because i took percocets for years. I used it as a medicine. But i didn't had any problem with addiction. I had dependency. and that dependency its happening in the brain, not in my personality or in my behaviors.

I heard a podcast today that taught me a lot about myself and about the opioid epidemic that is going on. I really wish i heard this 2 or 3 years ago.  
 [https://www.buzzsprout.com/927904/episodes/2996197](https://www.buzzsprout.com/927904/episodes/2996197) 

The doctor that speaks there (Seems like he is working with addiction medicine for many years) explains the stigma and the ignorance that is all over us, our families, friends and institutions that pre-judging us.

He pointed a lot of interesting thoughts that i haven't heard before.

Give it a listen. what do you think?"
264,1,"I know I need to kick the dope habit but I hate the whole cross addiction bs that they preach in rehabs and AA. ""If you're addicted to heroin then you're automatically addicted to all mood/mind altering substances."" Even in NA they say that. I don't believe that. When I tried total abstinence before I failed and went back to dope right away. This time I feel like allowing myself to drink occasionally and smoke pot will help me not look at recovery as so black and white. They say in AA how they can't believe that anyone would put down a half full beer and how they can't just have one. Well I have done both. Same thing with pot. When it comes to dope though I can definitely get carried away. My problem is how do I find support in groups like AA and NA while still partaking in certain substances just not heroin? Any body have a similar view point?

TL;DR: I have a problem with heroin. Why should that mean I can't smoke pot and drink a beer on occasion?"
265,1,"I am still not sure, whether I gonna finish this or just delete, like many times before ‚Äî the same with addiction: I have tried so many times, but it just became a part of me, the worst part and today I want to start erasing it from pages of novel called my life.

I am 25 ‚Äî feels like I am already went halfway through, and that I will not gonna make it more than 50 years.

Of course, it's started with H. In fact, many thing was before, but after him was only one thing ‚Äî methadone. Damn..

You can either drink or sniff it, but I've chosen worst option ‚Äî IV, which hurts you and kill your veins after couple injections.

I am using it about 3 years, and olny once I was almost clean: when I tried to stop using it IV and begin to use smaller dosages.. It almost worked, but I relapsed. Today it is not an option.

I have so much to say.. But I already taken last dose and begin to feel drowsy.

268,1,"Hello everyone üëã

So, I'm on Day 9. 

So far, feeling pretty good. My mood has improved, especially with taking a multivitamin. I still have low energy, and I still have to consume caffeine to get out of bed. But, I'm improving. 

Yesterday, I was experiencing cravings, and started to contemplate relapse. That lead me to question why people relapse. Which lead me to do a Google search :) 

Basically, I decided to start this thread for people to post what they know about the science of addiction, and to post questions if they have any. 

There's a lot of science out there, and a lot of theories, but I tend to focus on brain recovery through neuroplasticity. 

There are a lot of factors that influence neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to heal), but I like to focus on the factors a person can control. Lifestyle choices - including diet, exercise, getting enough sunlight, having social support, counseling etc. And other factors such as learning a new skill -- which has been shown to greatly impact brain healing. 

I think the science is really the key to overcoming addiction and prevention for future generations. 

Here's a video I watched yesterday. I thought it was informative. 

https://youtu.be/p0lL1MN2yCs"
269,1,"So like many of us have done before, I‚Äôve dug myself into a hole that I‚Äôm trying to claw out of.  Relapsed summer 18 mostly due to losing a really good career out of the blue, so I just said fuck it and next time I was close to any opioid I did it. Anyway off to the races.. eventually after a few weeks I used 5/7 days out of the week or daily fentanyl heroin (snorting).  Struggling I was able to not fully stop but prob by spring 2019 was about to string together a week, relapse once get another week, repeat, sometimes twice a week, but not daily use. Fast forward to end of summer fall 2019, I‚Äôm finally getting 2 weeks, relapse, than 3 weeks, maybe a month once. Since near xmas, my use has slowly ramped up and now it‚Äôs at about once every 5-6 days split between fent and opioids... the last 30 days I‚Äôve used 7 times. I‚Äôm at 6 days clean now.  Usually never any physical withdrawal symptoms. 

My big question is my social anxiety is at an all time high, like I have a good career where I am the youngest guy in a union shop with a lot of responsibility.  Nowadays especially the few days after using I can barely hold a convo with a coworker or supe or anyone I‚Äôve known without my face turning beat red, starting to sweat, feeling just that dread of anxiety.  

I‚Äôm kinda asking for some reassurance, my confidence is super low currently due to this infrequent use and not being able to control anything really right now other than finances. 

Does anyone have experience with this kind of intermittent use, if it will have you constantly in a state of feeling low and anxious, basically permanent PAWS? I am aware that if I can stay sober it will probably diminish but I wanna hear some testimonies if so, possibly for some motivation.

Thanks guys.. much love"
270,1,"I posted this on r/opiates but I figured it fits here too and I don't know how to crosspost as I suck at computers, lol.

I made a similar post about this a month or so ago, but a lot of things have changed as I've slipped further down the opiate slope. To catch you all up, my girlfriend and I have been doing various opiates every day for the past five months or so. That includes dilaudid, oxy, xr morphines, even snorting some ""H"" once, and most recently; fent patches. Oh how those fuck you over. The fent patches were the last straw.

To put it simply, I'm over it. I can't do this anymore. I can't take the cold sweats when I wake up, I can't take the mood swings when I don't have my pills, and I definitely can't take the lying, manipulating, and stealing from my family members who just want the best for me.

I've been to 12 step, rehab, therapy, psychiatrists, I've even spent 13 months in a residential treatment center when I was 14 and yet I still set myself up to fail. I'm only 19 and I've done pretty much every drug you can think of. Almost my entire high school experience is covered in a xanax, meth haze. For a while, I was proud of this. I almost got pleasure out of telling people I've tried everything, but now I see this is not the case. 

Now I see that this makes me a loser. I had no friends in high school and up until now I blamed that on the world, the other kids, and the teachers. But now I see that there is no one to blame but myself. I chose drugs over people.

Anyways, sorry for the rant I just needed to get my feelings out. My question is: what are the best tips you can give for someone who wants to quit opiates? I'm planning on using both prescription and otc drugs to ease the symptoms. So far I'm stockpiling benzos, gabapentin, kratom, clonidine, and maybe some muscle relaxers. What other medications help?

Besides medication, what are some tips to help with the mental/emotional aspects of withdrawal? I have very little willpower and know that no matter how much medication I load up on, my thoughts will be my biggest demon. Any and all tips are appreciated. 

Thank you for reading my long ass post and sorry for any spelling mistakes as I took a xanax earlier."
271,1,"Went to the exchange today and they were checking everyone's temp with a forehead thermometer for coronavirus risk. This exchange serves lots of sex workers as well so obviously people coming into close contact at a higher risk, might not have healthcare, yada yada.

Anyway, my temp was 95.something, then I asked him to take it again because I was like, do I have the inverse coronavirus? The good beer virus (ha.)) ? And it was 96.0 .

Note: I recently did a quick methadone taper off a pretty bad (but tapered) H habit (this has worked for me in the past, but I have to warn anyone else considering it the PAWS hits immediately and the cravings are right there and your tolerance is down and you are at risk for OD if you relapse). Have extended it a little longer than I'd like. Did maybe 7 days, jumping off at 10mg. Felt fine then three days later BAD cravings and couldn't sleep. Took 20mg yesterday and then had the weird temp thing today. I wasn't feeling cold sweats or even cold and it was about 55 degrees out so I was stumped. Then I slowly started to feel shitty...ive been working out hardcore because that's the best thing that helps PAWS for me...but had my coat on the whole time I did 40 min of decently intense cardio. Was so cold. Plus I've been walking everywhere. Took 10mg of juice when I got home a few hrs ago and feel better but don't have a thermometer.

Of course my paranoid ass searched the internet and low body temp can be a sign of particularly bad sepsis. But I don't think I have any other signs of that???

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it the slight withdrawal from the extra days of my meth taper? I always thought acute withdrawal made you feel HOT, but with chills. Or is it just PAWS and the dreaded temperature deregulation already starting? Then of course I read Opiates themselves lower body temp so I'm just totally confused. Is it the tiny bit of methadone?

This time I'm looking into supplements and food to repair my dopamine system, btw. Tryptophan and all that. I'm already committed to the exercise and human connection. But my dumb ass ALSO read PAWS can last 18 months??? I'm sure that's with longer and stronger habits (mine was 5 yrs with like 4 months of good clean time in the middle?) which mine was. But I was lucky enough to support my habit which means i haven't had much of the dreaded kindling effect. I know I'm psyching myself out with the 18 months PAWS thing. I'm feeling alternately great and shitty. I just know last time I still felt bad at 4 months, but I realize now there was a big emotional component. I have more support now but am still terrified of the physical symptoms that really aren't talked about enough. Worst flu for 7 days? Try that plus months of a mild flu.

Sorry for the long post. I can't be the only one who gets chatty in recovery. Thanks to anyone who reads and/or responds to this. I have supportive (pothead - I'm jealous, it gives me major anxiety) friends who I'm just recently opening up to (they always knew, I think) but it helps to talk to people who've been there."
272,1,"Hey guys, I am on day 8 here. 

I have looked into meetings, and at first I thought Celebrate Recovery would be okay... but then I looked at their website and immediately was not feeling it. Ironically, I AM Christian. But, I feel that my belief and faith is something very personal to me, and I don't like it when people seem to force things on me. 

So... Then I looked up SMART Recovery which I had seen mentioned on here, and that also lead me to LifeRing. Has anyone heard of these other recovery groups? 

I like the idea of secular, evidence based recovery. I am a spiritual person -- but I do believe that God gave me a mind. And my mind wants to understand the science of addiction. I want to understand the psychology, and the physiology. I want to know what I can do on a practical level to stay sober and avoid relapse. 

So, anyone with thoughts? Opinions? 

What has your experience with group therapy/recovery been like?"

275,1,"I began an outpatient counselling program alongside a MAT(Suboxone) program recently. The latter part of the outpatient program has yet to begin since they've had a surge in people wanting to get clean.

 This is good because that means more people who are suffering are seeing help getting clean, but I cannot help but feel a bit bitter since it's causing me to need to wait "" four to six weeks"" before getting into the MAT ""go to the pharmacy at the same time each day ti get your dose"" program.

The thing I am struggling with the most has been the counseling aspect. The women doing this is very friendly and I feel comfortable with her since I have now and my first entry session with her and my second/first follow-up. We spoke about many things and she let me get things off my chest, but there is no actual program to follow she claims. She doesn't have a specific method of helping me explore why I started using drugs or anything else. She is just there to listen to me and give her feedback.

What I want to know is what I could do to get the most out of this counselling. Should I be trying to create my own structure to the counselling? Should I just wing-it and talk about whatever comes to mind during our sessions?

Basically I don't see how this counselling will benefit me in the long-run the way that it is setup at the moment. I want this counselling to be an effective part of this whole recovery thing...but I was expecting more of a structured program where this ""expert/counseller""would be guiding me on exploring things?

I apologize if I am not making alot of sense right now. I jsut want to get the most out of this counselling that has been offered to me, but I have never been good at structuring things myself or anything...in the last I have ALWAYS required the psychologist or whoever to guide me, ask me certain questions, basically like a school class. I have never been great at self-learning myself things I am interested in learning about and I NEED formal education wirna teacher, progeam to follow,etc.

Please help me succeed by getting the most out of this counselling while I wait and suffer through withdrawal on a weekly basis before getting the green light on the Suboxone treatment

Slept about 3 hours, not having a hard time falling asleep, just can't stay asleep.

Started my day with a bottle of water, a smoothie, 500mg of dlpa, and 2g of yellow borneo.

Not really feeling the boost from the kratom as I cut my dose in half, but that's what I'm going for. I feel as if I have this need to escape my feelings and that's what led me to opiates in the first place, so I kind of want to stop the kratom, and stay away from anything that makes me feel ""high"", if that makes sense. 

Working 9 hours today, but I feel great, just a little tired but I'm just so excited about this new life I have that I have all the motivation in the world right now! I got home yesterday, and actually took my 5 year old girl out to play some soccer and we went and rode bikes. It doesn't sound like a lot, but the whole time I was on opiates/subs, I would be high all day at work and come home and get straight in bed because I just had mo energy, always felt like shit, and was just all around feeling awful about myself. So to be able to do that with her felt SO GOOD! Man the way her face lit up when  I asked her if she wanted to play! I'm crying as I'm typing this, just thinking about that makes me realize just how much I was missing out on bc of my addiction. Never again though!

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone on here, I honestly wouldn't have made it this far without you all. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this, so being able to talk to all of you, and get all of this off my chest, has helped immensely! I will check in with you guys every day, just bc I feel like it makes meaccountable! Thanks for listening and have a great day everyone!"
280,1,"so i moved to houston, and obviously it wasn‚Äôt working how i wanted it too. i‚Äôm not even worried about being tempted when i get back to mi tho! i‚Äôm so proud and mindful about it too. and low key i keep breaking all the rules at ne he airport so.. well lol. wish me luck hahaha. vaping, smuggling my perfume and just swallowed the last 5 xanax i had so i wouldn‚Äôt get a charge cause texas ain‚Äôt playing lol."
281,1,"i think you can make the context out, but just incase here it is.
I met this girl a few months ago, she wasn't using as much back then and was much more coherent. This is when I fell for her and she shared things with me about her past and said things about me to make me feel that she genuinely liked me. Too bad I can't say for certain if its true or not. She suffered severe trauma and i would say she's overall a good person who had a bad roll of the dice.

She's been smoking heroin pretty much daily since i've known her and i've been trying to help her get her life on track. Things like getting her ID and drivers license back, opening up a bank account, helping her book hotels, and since her love language is gifts, I've spent thousands of dollars on her. Even offered to buy her a used car if she got clean. 

She had made me a promise that made me feel for the first time that she cared about me and knew what I wanted from her (quality time spent together where she's not nodding off). This was the highest high of our relationship. Followed immediately by ghosting me for a week and claiming to have forgotten about said promise. I confronted her about it recently and we cleared some things up and she said she'd deliver this time. Fast forward to today where she basically goes back on her word again and tries to make it seem like im the asshole...


Here's the letter

&gt; You know that I care about you so much; Why do you still try to paint me as a bad guy? 
&gt; 
&gt; yea its probably not worth it for _you_. But after everything we've been through; after all I've done for you, isn't it worth it so that just once, you can make _me_ happy? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  I'm tired though. Whenever we're together in person you are usually relaxed and I'd go as far as to say you would rather have my company than be alone. I'm slowly getting you to laugh more as well. But whenever you msg me, you're always so aggressive and hostile. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I could do this forever.
&gt; I thought I wanted to..
&gt; I thought If I was persistent enough you'd eventually be mine. I never thought I'd give up.... 
&gt; I hate the idea of giving up on anything. It's totally off brand for me, and I think that's whats fucking with my self-identity right now.

&gt; as much as It kills me to keep trying to make this work, I think the pain is even worse knowing that I don't want to do this anymore. I really thought I could make things better. I really thought if I helped you get your life together that I would matter to you.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm literally losing days maybe weeks of my life because of all the stress. And what do I have to show? You were never going to end up with me. I was just someone for you to manipulate. I'm so disappointed in myself.
&gt;

283,1,"I‚Äôve been holding at .25 every day for almost 6 months. I did it on my own and ended up in the hospital with other health related issues. They wouldn‚Äôt give me the suboxone because I didn‚Äôt have a current script and told me they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cut suboxone in half‚Äù lol. So I went 50 hours without and I‚Äôm released from the hospital. 

Yesterday at 24-40 hours wasn‚Äôt so bad, honestly probably just was anxiety. Now starting to get chills, sweating, jolts, dizziness, just general feeling of like a sinus infection. Will this get worse and if so how worse? I would like to just quit but it‚Äôd be sort of dangerous as I‚Äôm supposed to be monitoring symptoms after being released from the hospital, as I might not know what symptoms are what. 

Just would like some opinions or experiences. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd be fine and I‚Äôve been told it won‚Äôt start until 72 hours and I don‚Äôt want it to end up getting worse and wasting my time by sitting here sick for no reason."
284,1,"This passage spoke to me.

285,1,"I just got past the withdrawal part, now reality is kind of hitting me in the face. It feels really overwhelming without being able to numb myself and I'm struggling with actually wanting to stay clean.

Any words of wisdom?

(Ps. I had to quit my job in order to get clean and once my tax refund money runs out I'll have to get a job again cause my wife stays home with our 6 month old baby. Thinking about going back to work while staying clean is also overwhelming)

Thanks guys."
286,1,"So after my overdose I had accrued myself a substantial amount of medical debt. Of course this was a burden on my recovery because it stressed me the hell out. Today a letter comes in the mail and informs me that I‚Äôve been approved for 100% financial assistance to cover my bills. 


Not government assistance but Upmc (hospital) assistance. I guess they decided that since the last 20 times I‚Äôve been there I hadn‚Äôt paid them so why would I pay them now? Rather than sell the debt to a debt collector they‚Äôd just write it off as a charitable donation. And like that all my medical debt (20000$) is gone. And I have free health insurance for three months too!somehow despite no matter how many times I fall in shit I always come out with diamonds. thank you capitalism."
287,1,"Prob a long shot, but does any one have any tips or anything to help with the cold sweats from sub wd? I'm taking about 3-4 gs of kratom twice a day so I don't know if that's making it worse, but I just want to be comfortable! 
Thanks in advance!"
290,1,I just took 6 mg of lope because my stomach feels like I could shit at any moment. Should I take more? Would  a higher dose of loperamide extend my withdrawals?
291,1,"Disclaimer: this is only my second day on reddit so I hope I don't get post blocked for posting/commenting too frequently!

Just want to give an update, as it helps me. 
I got about 4 hours of sleep last night, which was more than I've been getting so I'm grateful for that! 
It's also getting easier and easier to get going in the mornings, so that's a blessing. 

I did take my morning 4 gs of green vein to get me going so there's that. I really don't want to become dependent on kratom to feel normal/happy so after I'm done with the 3 ounces I have left I don't want to get any more. O e thing that scares me though is what I've read about the paws. I've been diagnosed with bipolar depression, and was getting high just to feel happy so I think that's going to be my biggest challenge. I have some 500mg dlpa 
Caps coming today so I'm hoping that will help with the depression once I get through these wds. I'm not too familiar with dlpa or the dosing, so if anyone has any tips for me I would greatly appreciate it! 

Well I've spent the first hour of my work day on reddit so I better get to it! Lol just wanted to reach out cause you all have helped me more than you know! Reddit has been so great with letting me get all this off my chest and realize I don't have to do this alone, so thank you all! I appreciate and value every one of you, and I hope everyone has a great day, thank you for listening!&lt;3"
292,1,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. About a year and a half ago my family had an intervention with me about my 55mg/day habit with hydrocodone. I was self medicating for pain I have had for a couple of years. Doctors said it was all in my head. I am in my 20‚Äôs btw so I can understand that. I really was in pain, but I will not excuse the fact that I am an addict. Anyways, I detoxed and withdrew, then went to rehab. Rehab had me put on subs for about 6 months and I suddenly stopped showing up for MAT, because I wanted off and to be free. I successfully tapered and CT‚Äôd off the subs. Finally found a doctor that found what was wrong and I had my surgery. 

After surgery I was prescribed hydrocodone for only a week because of the lovely medical records that doctors need to view to watch their own ass. I found a way to self medicate with more hydros and have been ever since the surgery because PT never brought me back to 70%. I have tried epsom salt baths and the whole sh-bang. Can‚Äôt do marijuana because any strain or breed or whatever makes me paranoid (jealous of you potheads btw). 

I hit a point where I just want to be done. Very similar to heroin addicts. I don‚Äôt even chase the high or relief. I just literally can NOT afford to get sick. I have bills to pay. I have entrapped myself and I take full responsibility for my own mistakes. It‚Äôs even harder when your job is retail and requires you to stand for hours on end throughout the day. 

I refuse to involve family or go back to rehab. And I am aware doing this solo will be 99% impossible, but I want to take on the challenge. I tried doing some research on kratom and purchased a bottle of red vein bali kratom capsules. I‚Äôm honestly afraid of how it will make me feel. I am not a fan of foreign feelings like marijuana. The idea of letting go of the wheel. Should I take the capsules whole, or dump them in a cup of water and take it. Daily dose of hydro is 55mg/day. I just need pointers and maybe some support through here so I don‚Äôt have to feel like I am doing this alone."
293,1,"Around 40-50mg of oxy a day every day for four years. I have crohn's disease that can be pretty painful so getting it prescribed wasn't a problem.

Around 8 days ago I went cold turkey because I'm tired of being a slave to this shit. I'm doing mostly okay now, but I've got a constant feeling of nausea in the back of my throat and stomach 24/7, along with a really weird static tv feeling in my head.

Will these subside in a short amount of time? I'm not sure how long I'd be okay feeling like this. I had kratom for emergencies and it's super tempting to take it to make it go away, but I've held off for now."
294,1,"Relapsed about week ago. On Sunday I did a blast in my bosses car and had a seizure, turns out my week of use landed me with rhabdomyolysis where my kidneys start to break down my muscles and I started to piss out muscle fibers. Now I'm stuck in Hospital an hour away from my hometown till my kidney levels improve. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. Well I'm back on subs till I leave and i guess I'll just keep on the stright and narrow."
295,1,"I relapsed on pills. I'm in significant pain that requires insurance I don't have to fix the source of what's causing the pain. I can't pay out of pocket for the procedures or insurance because rent needs to be paid first. It's only $250 for the insurance but I can't afford it. 

The pain pushed me over the edge. Over a year of sobriety gone. I didn't just take one or two to ease the pain either. I spent 2 weeks using daily. I don't pay for the pills either so finding reasons to stay clean isn't as easy as finding reasons to use. The pain, lack of cost, the easy access. 

My partner is *so fucking angry* with me. I deserve it. The trust that was there is completely gone. Again. He found the evidence of it, and said ""when did your sobriety end?""

This time around I *want* to be clean. Last time it was forced and I fucked off for a long time before actually stopping. I hate NA/support groups. I am unable to do inpatient or IOP. Just stopping and having the support of my partner was all I could do. 

I'm positive that I will stay clean for good after this. I'm in therapy this time around. I am working with my psych to adjust my meds to help with my deep depression and suicidal ideation. I only used fo3ur 2 weeks which is going to make this easier to kick. 

But, if I hadn't been caught, I don't know when or if I'd take the plunge to get clean again. That's a big reason why he's angry. I lied to him when he confronted me about having some on me, but after sleeping on it and thinking about what I wanted to do, I told him the whole truth the next morning and handed him not just the pills, but the medication I had been hiding to commit suicide. My suicidal ideation isn't constant, and I'm not suicidal currently, but I had it on me for the day I wanted to sue. 

I told him last night that I loved him, and he was silent in return. I deserve that. 

I asked him if he was willing to be my support system, as I literally have no one else and this will be hard some days. He said he doesn't know how much he can give me at this point. I asked if he loves me, and he said yes ""but not right now"". 

I relapsed and lied about it. He's so very upset. When I told him and our young child this morning that I loved them on the way out the door to work, he was silent again. 

I'm a piece of shit, I'm so broken. I use to relieve my pain and forget about my traumas. I have bad PTSD and struggle with my triggers daily. I can't do this without his support. He won't even look at me. I'll try having a conversation about all this and he won't put his phone down or look away from the computer. He makes it crystal clear that he doesn't care about me anymore. 

And that is why I don't want to be sober. But I can't keep using, nor do I want to if I'm being honest. 

Addiction makes me so selfish. It hurts those around me, badly. It makes me untrustworthy. It makes me easy to hate. It's completely my fault. But when the man I love so deeply has lost his love and fucks to give about me, when he won't even break his attention from his screens to discuss this, the need to use is stronger than ever. 

And I did it to myself, 100%. I don't deserve him. And he certainly shouldn't bother with me anymore. 

I'm just rambling but fuck I'm hurting. 

Day # 2. This is the last day 2 I'll ever go through again. I promise that much, even if my word means nothing anymore."
296,1,When going threw withdrawal off Hydrocodone 6 a day habit for about 4-5 years off and on... I had really bad RLS before the norco but of course it gets worse when I stopped the norco. I have Gabapentin 600mg left over from a long time ago and I finally used it last night for the Withdrawal RLS and it didn‚Äôt work at all? Has anyone else had that problem? It use to work for me and I would only take half but yesterday for the night I had to take 2 and i was still rolling all over the bed from the RLS.
297,1,"So, I thought I would make this sub for anyone that is really struggling and looking for little things they can do to feel better. 

1) Excedrin: It has tylenol and caffeine. I still have slight ongoing pain, so this really helps. Especially in the morning. 

2) A small dose of multivitamin. I take micro doses two times a day of my multivitamin. The reason I don't take a lot, is because large amounts will cause me anxiety, and nightmares. But a small amount gives me energy and makes me feel happy and energized. 

3) Warm bath or warm shower. I think because I am more sensitive after stopping the opiates, little things like this mean so much. Taking a warm shower in the morning, is extremely soothing. Especially because it is so cold where I'm at. 

4) Writing in my journal. Today I wrote down all the bad things about addiction, because I was experiencing cravings. It really helped to put a stop to them. 

5) Clonidine and alprazolam. I have about 2 pills left of each. I avoided the restless leg syndrome this time thanks to these meds. 

6) Sunshine. 

I hope this helps someone! Hang in there everyone :)"
298,1,"Hi all: Last week I was diagnosed by my pain management doc with ""opioid misuse disorder"". I've had 2 back surgeries in the last 7 months and I was on some kind of opioid (mostly oxycodone) every day. I was lying to myself in the last month as to how I'd become dependent: super anxious about making sure I ""had enough"", signs of withdrawal if I didn't take it regularly (irritable, muscle aches, flu like symptoms), taking more than prescribed because the prescribed dose wasn't as strong anymore, and so forth.

The doctor put me on suboxone and so far I'm up to 12 mg daily. I was taking at max 50 mg of oxy per day. The first day of withdrawals really sucked. The suboxone has relieved some of my back pain but I know that's not why I'm taking it; the only time I ""crave"" the oxy is right after physical therapy when my back muscles are spasming so badly that I'm shuffle stepping down the street.

Current side effects: super sleepy but also having insomnia, feeling fuzzy headed in thinking. I'm also having muscle twitching all over but I read that's a side effect/withdrawal of oxycodone. Maybe I'm still having withdrawal? I talked to my doc yesterday and she encouraged me to split the suboxone to 4mg three times daily to decrease my sleepiness (I work full time). 

Does this get better? I don't want to spend months feeling this way. I can't take any other type of pain medication due to having had weight loss surgery (can't take ibuprofen because it can cause ulcers) so all I have is a muscle relaxer. It helps but I still have spasms so bad that I yell out loud when I get out of bed.

The pain docs are very nice and they have a great substance use program; I'm seeing their addiction specialist this week. I never thought I'd be in a place like this: I've never used illegal drugs, don't drink excessively...but addiction runs in my family so I was always at higher risk. Thanks for reading."
299,1,"I‚Äôm finally getting my shot Tomorrow.

My story is no different or unique: I kept rescheduling the shot because I could stay clean for 7 damn days.

I‚Äôll get my life back. Hopefully. Put all this madness behind me!"
300,1,So I've been using opiates for about 3 years when I decided I was finally ready to quit. After trying and failing over and over I had a friend recommend suboxone to me. Long story short I am now trying to kick a year long sub habit. It's been about 6 days since my last dose and these withdrawals have me wanting to hit up everyone I know who may have suboxone. I hid my habit from my gf/family so now that I want to quit I feel like I don't have any one to lean on or talk to about this struggle. Any suggestions or tips for wd relief would be greatly appreciated! And honestly just some encouraging words would really mean a lot. First time reddit user here so bear with me please! Thank you!
302,1,"Let me clarify I dont know if I‚Äôm really using it to get clean or if I‚Äôll just go pickup some fent pressed roxies after I get paid next week and I‚Äôm just using this so I can still go to work and not be sick , but I‚Äôm playing it by year .. Anyway I‚Äôve tried to get clean multiple times I‚Äôve been to 3 different rehabs been to one 3 times , I‚Äôve tried NA/AA tried the steps but I hated it and still do and I always went back to using, I tried cold turkey no programs nothing that was a mess.. I‚Äôm an atheist I‚Äôm not spiritual unless I‚Äôm on shrooms so I dont know what to do, but I tried asking my dr for suboxone and he thought it might e a good idea so I‚Äôm tryin it out but we‚Äôll see I‚Äôve been on it all day and I‚Äôve wanted to use all day pretty much"
303,1,"Made the stupid decision to come clean and tell my doctor and tell her please I need something for my anxiety she said you have been living with it so why should u need something now?

 we agreed id come back in 1 year and she would help me if it was the same. So it is the same and now I learn my new insurance she doesn't take.

 So thanks doctor bitch, probably have addiction on my paperwork now. what should I do to find more support in my area.

 I go to AA but NEED more. I need something I feel like or I will go crazy. 

I was trying to get xanax or gabapentinor val or anything literally! (and no i didnt say any names of drugs to her) just something that works better than ibuprofen for extreme nerve pain from withdrawal.
So I'm posting to see what is available, im on the west coast in a nice city. 

oh and yeah I got back on dope that week after she told me that thinking fine, fuck you. I actually quit heroin as fucking difficult as it was and she is going to tell me, I can tell your fine. 

Like no shit I look okay because suboxone only! and I want to taper off it to not be on opiates my entire life. 

 I can see now that I deserve better but my god it is tough to even get help. Like so because the doctor wont give me a god damn benzo, 


I am so tempted to try benzos on the street but I KNOW thats how you get fentanyl and I don't want to die. But I did buy some and it wasn't fent, but each time I took one I think,

 ""Okay my anxiety is so bad I will take the risk of death to get the tiniest bit of relief from this. If I die, I die.""
 and did that 20 different times so far. 

I'm really fucking scared next time I won't be so lucky. Please anybody anything, I need advice for what is available in this f'd up system and what others that felt similar situations and what you did?? 
 Thank you sooo much if anybody was able to get through my drivel."
304,1,"Maybe it‚Äôs just me, and I‚Äôm just looking for some if any insight but I will elaborate...

I enjoy pain. I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed, hell I know I‚Äôm not. Maybe that‚Äôs just an oxymoron but I really don‚Äôt feel what constitutes as ‚Äúdepression‚Äù as I don‚Äôt want to die I want to live and have a nice healthy life. I have a great job, great friends and a loving family.

BUT...I can‚Äôt escape this feeling of just thinking pain is my motivating factor in life. Is that fucked up? 

I‚Äôll go further into why I‚Äôm currently feeling this. It‚Äôs mainly due to relationships and dating, but that‚Äôs a huge part of life. I really like this girl I have been talking to. A big part of me wants to see where it can go and maybe it can develop into something. That‚Äôs what my heart wants. My head just deep down wants her to stop responding to me. To just realize I am low key a piece of shit with a fucked up past. If she never answers me back or ghosts me then subconsciously I‚Äôm....happy...er? I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense. It‚Äôs like my mind wants me to feel this pain and numb it with something, mainly alcohol I‚Äôll never do opiates again. 

I can‚Äôt escape this feeling. I want to fuck this up before it gets too good. Because once it goes good I‚Äôm waiting for it to go bad. I think this final sentence really sums up how I feel."
305,1,"I‚Äôve made a few posts since finding this community a couple months ago when I relapsed after 2 years clean from the dope.

Haven‚Äôt gotten too bad, really been on top of managing the use, obviously I don‚Äôt want to use at all but I was managing the best I could to make sure I didn‚Äôt get to bad. I‚Äôm on day 5 right now and it‚Äôs been a  good day. I‚Äôve used a total of 4.5 mg of Suboxone and been smoking weed to help with any withdrawals trying to use as little Suboxone I used those the first two days and I haven‚Äôt dosed and Suboxone yesterday or today so far which I‚Äôm really happy about. Hoping to not have to use any from here on out. Either way I‚Äôm feeling good mentally, the withdrawals were really making me scared of trying to quit but getting the subs really helped with making me give it a shot. It hasn‚Äôt been that bad of wds so that‚Äôs good just mentally I am fucked up due to the dope and also me being off my psych meds for bipolar 1 and that was a big reason due to my relapse two months ago, I lost my insurance and haven‚Äôt been able to get my meds filled which I really need so currently mentally I am really fucked up but I‚Äôm hanging in there I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm 5 days off the dope being back on the dope made me mentally feel a million times worse I wanted to be dead even more.

I know I have everything going for me right now, that my life can be something, yet I'm still considering this offer. Would there be a price to pay for it? Yes, of course, but I can't seem to stop myself from entering into risky situations. I feel like there is a battle going on inside of me right now.

Day 32- kickin ass"
308,1,Am detoxing from oxys and a friend gave me a bottle of gabapentin. Does it have any benefit?
309,1,"7 years ago, I was a half dead junkie, in and out of jail, prison and hospitals, living in a tent by the river, and owned a backpack. Today, I'm sober, with all my legal problems taken care of. I have a decent home,  with a few nice things (I know material things aren't that important, but it's nice to have a few things that I'm not giving the dope man for collateral or pawning/selling) we have a dog that we love. My family trusts me again. No longer does anyone  automatically come to me if something is missing. Most of my nephews and nieces, thankfully, don't  remember or weren't born while I was active in my addiction. I have my kid in my life, although unfortunately he's in prison. My bonus son (I hate step) is in our lives now, and actually wants and likes to come over. 
And we finally saved up, and yesterday, 
paid cash for our brand new to me Chevy Tahoe.
I NEVER thought I'd be where I am. I'd basically  given up. My little brother had just died from an overdose. It should have been me!!!!! I decided to give the Methadone program one more chance (I don't do well on Suboxone) and I'm so thankful I did.
 I'm so thankful that I did. I'm doing it, not trying, but actually doing it! Hashtag WECANRECOVER"
310,1,"Self explanatory, 

Backstory : I was off opiates and on a suboxone taper for about a year. I got off suboxone and have been off around 9 months. 

Anyways, I had a slip and have been using oxy 30s for about a month. 

I need to stop and go through withdraw while I‚Äôm off work the next week. However it‚Äôs sucks having to play and act ‚Äúsick‚Äù when I‚Äôm really detoxing. How do I come clean and yell my wife I slipped but I‚Äôm getting back on track? I want to come clean but obviously I‚Äôm nervous.

Thanks for listening. And if you have advice I‚Äôm all ears."
311,1,"I just feel like rambling a little about this. I was doing a gram or more of fentanyl every day for years so as you can imagine, my initial withdrawal was hell on earth. The physical agony was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. Terrible, terrible time. Anyway,

In rehab they talked to me about post acute withdrawal syndrome, and I didn‚Äôt think much of it or take it that seriously. I‚Äôve had major depression since I was a young child, so the idea of being depressed was Whatever to me. Nothing I hadn‚Äôt already been dealing with my whole life. I was so certain that if I could manage to get through those first couple weeks of all the painful physical symptoms I would be golden. Surely the acute withdrawal had to be the worst part of the process. Surely. 

Well,

As I approached my two month milestone, PAWs got its claws (rhyme intended?) in me. I was so miserable and depressed...and like I said I‚Äôve always been depressed, but holy shit this was different. I won‚Äôt even try to describe it because no words can do it justice. I don‚Äôt have the words to describe how absolutely hopeless and tired and sad I was. 

And I was still experiencing physical pain on top of it all. It wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the same as the pain I felt those first few weeks clean, but it was a beast in and of itself. It was like....death by a thousand cuts. Like being slowly burned to death over a fire. I was constantly sore and aching and lethargic. All day every day. It took great effort to do even basic tasks. That pain took a devastating toll on my mental health and was, quite literally, driving me insane. 

It finally got so bad that I was becoming suicidal. Like, not just vague ideation like I‚Äôve had before, but actual vivid and detailed plans were forming in my head. I got  very scared I was going to hurt myself, and admitted myself to the hospital/psych ward. They started me on a new mood stabilizer and, thank the stars, things slowly started getting better after that. 

TLDR: I thought acute physical withdrawal was gonna be the worst part of recovery, experienced PAWs, and promptly ended up in a mental hospital for planning to kill myself. 

The good news is, this was months ago, and I‚Äôm doing SO much better now. But....yeah. Things certainly do get worse before they get better, huh?"

315,1,"Feeling a little tired this morning. The time change definitely messed with me more than it usually does but other than that I'm feeling really good. My parents rescured two older dogs and I get to see them this weekend. Looking forward to that, but in the mean time will enjoy today."
316,1,"Before me and my gf started dating she was using heroin. She was severely depressed after her mother died (also a drug user. Idk what she used), and she went into a dark place. Heroin consumed her. She got into legal trouble and cleaned up. It's been four years since she used but there was another death in her family and she has been depressed. What are some warning signs? How can I help her? What do I do?! I know addicts will find anything and talking is probably worthless. Idk. I'm lost. If she starts using again, I'm putting her back into group. Is there anything at all to keep her from using again?"
317,1,I relapsed again early today and have been taking kratom while at work to make it through. Im trying to wait a few more hours to take sub because my tolerance is high and the kratom isn't strong enough. Im imagining 3 day taper on sub and going back to kratom. I don't know if im being dumb. I just don't think ill be able to go to work if i depend on solely the kratom. I've come for support because i really don't want to use ever again and to tell my story of dealing with my withdrawal with anyone searching and hoping to kick the habit as well.
318,1,"Technically, I stopped taking hydrocodone about 3 weeks ago, but I don't count that because I was still taking tramadol. And I wasn't really feeling the affects of stopping hydro because I was still taking an opioid. 

I started the clock on the 4th, that was my last day of tramadol. 

So far, I have been struggling with the issues I knew that I would probably face (but was secretly hoping I wouldn't) -- and that is the energy sucking fatigue and the loss of joy. 

I still feel motivated to do things - but I don't have the energy. Even going up and down the stairs leaves me feeling like I need to rest, and I'm normally a very energetic person and do exercises like stairs without issue. 

Fortunately, I did have a prescription for a med that helped with anxiety, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome -- so I didn't experience that. 

But, the loss of energy is depressing. 

I have been taking some Excedrin (with caffeine) to help with energy and any issues with pain. But I took a few of them today, and just felt ""okay"". I didn't feel like I could walk very far, or run errands, or anything like that. Just generally well enough to get out of bed, and sit in the sun for a while. 

I think I'm being hard on myself, and hard on my body. I want it to bounce back right away, and I know it won't because I've read many books on addiction. I know that it will take a good 3-4 months to even feel a bit more like myself. 

How do you deal with the frustration?"
319,1,"Hello all. I'm not sure if I'm in the right place for this question, but here it goes. 

I am currently involved in a relationship with a recovering addict, and I'm afraid he's using again. From what I understand he was a high functioning heroin addict (supposedly held a Wall Street job) and he has been clean for a few years, but had one or two relapses in there. I personally have no experience with the drug, and don't have much experience with it's addicts, so I want to make sure I'm not assuming things and over-reacting. I've tried googling lots of stuff, but it just gives me information on addiction, and not what signs I should be looking for. 

There's lots of things I've noticed over the year we've being together, but sadly I just recently started putting the pieces together... It's hard for him to hold down a job. He finds excuses to go out to his car a lot while he is spending time with me. He is very secretive with things, almost to the point where I don't even feel like I know him sometimes. He will disappear for a day sometimes, and says he left his phone at home, or some other excuse. Sometimes he is so manic with so much energy,  it almost looks like he's been doing coke.. his pupils will be small and he will be bouncing off the walls talking a million miles an hour, and other times he seems so tired and delirious I feel like he's drunk, and he will just sleep the entire day. Then there is the temper, lately his temper has been so off the walls, name calling, belittling me, and then telling me that he just wants to give a taste of my own medicine, that I'm asking for it, but begging me to unblock him,. I've seen a lot of sociopathic behavior, but lately I've just felt like it's been different. He never as any money, he doesn't work out anymore and he was so into fitness when we met, I feel like I can't connect with him at all. I don't think he's using heroin again, but I haven't exactly been looking for needle marks, I'm concerned he's manipulated my elderly neighbor into giving him pain pills. He is very charming,. 

I'm aware my relationship is over. After his last freakout I blocked him, and haven't responded to his 5 emails over the past few days telling me how horrible of a girlfriend I am since then, but I am more concerned with his well-being. if I should try and contact family and let them know I think there's a problem. We both live in San Diego, and all of his family is on the East Coast. He doesn't have many friends here as he just moved here a few months ago, and I'm afraid if he's using, his using will only increase if I continue to ignore him. I don't know where else to go or who else to ask.."
320,1,"If someone is overdosing on hydrocodone can they throw up an hour after taking too many pills to stop the overdose ..or can they take suboxone to stop the overdose ?
Or is it even possible to be overdosing on the said amount of pills 7 pills in a 10 hour period all 10 mg each ??"
321,1,"I‚Äôve been reading on the use of Naltrexone in ultra low doses (10-20mcg 3 x per day) as an effective way to lower opiate tolerance.

I only have access to Naloxone, my pharmacy gives them out to prevent overdoses. I‚Äôve seen some literature online about how Naloxone &amp; naltrexone are interchangeable. Which is strange since ones an agonist &amp; the other an antagonist.

Has anyone ever used Naloxone in very low doses to lower tolerance ?
And do you use the same protocol? 10-20mcg?"

Finally made it on vivitrol about 2 weeks ago after my fiasco with 24 days of testing positive for fent and then fent metabolites.

Lifes going surprisingly well and I'm actually happy to FEEL life again, the ups and the downs. Never been big on NA but been doing meetings since I can't do IOP cause work. Need to get a sponsor to continue the lifestyle changes/weed out the addictive behaviour and get to the bottom of issues that caused me (best friends death/7 year relationship ending in flames/parental relationships etc etc) to use and try to heal but in general I have such a more positive outlook on my life and future then I did 41 days ago when I KNEW id be dead or in prison soon. Thank you so much to everyone and anyone here who gave me advice, inspired me or kept me pushing through those first 3 weeks when I was so discouraged bc fent metabolites stayed in my system so long. P.S. has vivitrol caused anyone to have acne or is that just my hormones being all out of whack and coming back? I noticed it some b4 when doing cold turkey just from not showering as much as i should and being sweaty and oily and I'm sure hormones(lol gross I know) but definitely noticing it more now since shot, not sure if that's cause for concern or not will check with my Doc asap obv was just curious if anyone else here experienced same thing.

329,1,"I'm not a doctor, but I was a heroin addict for a solid 30+ years. During that time I grew to hate my addiction beyond measure. I suffered a ton of partial detoxes, went off and on methadone (which always brings me to a very suicidal place).
I even tried URD, ultra rapid detox. I was acutely sick for 3 months after that. I don't know why. Suffice to say that like most things I'd tried it did more harm than good and wound up in another relapse.
I finally got my head ready to get off of all opiates. Yet my experience being that each time detox seemed to get harder and last longer. So I was immensely terrified. I started scouring the internet and stumbled across something that seemed laughable to me, but given all else had failed and kratom didn't work for me the way it does for some, I read the silly article on the silly seeming blog. It proclaimed a ""cure for opiate detox"" has been known for years, but the doctor who'd proclaimed that was basically made a mockery of.
I looked up that doctor, who's name escapes me now. Everything the website had said about him was a little buried on Google but I had easy luck with DDG. Only problem I had was he was giving his megadoses by IV, and though I'd shot dope for years, I had no idea how to replicate that at home.
So, I went back to the original website called calm support and looked a little closer at what it said, and in the comment section as well. Now, this site does offer a few of their own products and a coaching program by the guy who put it up
 His name is Matt Finch. And though he has videos all over youtube and offers so many different ways to detox from opiates, some of which I had tried already to no avail. Despite the myriad of literature and videos he'd put up, I could find not one review of him, his products or anything else, aside from testimonials he posted on his own site, and that increased my skepticism.
I was pretty broke at the time as are most end of the road junkies. So, I could definitely not afford his remedies or services.
Here's what I was able to do. I had a bottle of gabapentin (another tool he recommends, but only for the first few days. The worst ones). I had benzos that I take for epilepsy, but I have a tolerance, so they likely didn't do much to help. I had potassium, Benadryl and some NSAIDS. Basically, comfort meds that had done little to nothing to help in prior detox attempts.
With great skepticism, and very little cash I ordered ascorbic acid type vitamin C. As recommended by the website I began taking scheduled doses along with lower amounts of heroin for 3 days before stopping. I actually slept the first 2 days of ct. I still had a few grams in my kitchen the whole time. No need to touch it. Then I hit a hiccup. I hit what they call ""bowel tolerance"" and I wasn't going to take a large enough dose of Imodium to stop it, because I didn't want to drag out my detox.
So I broke down and did what I should have done from the start I ordered the more expensive type of vitamin C that has no bowel tolerance. It was a liquid form of liposomal vitamin c. I got the brand Matt recommended though I'm certain from other people's experience I turned on to the method, cheaper brands work just as well. During the 2 days of waiting on the new vitamin C I cut it out and detox reared its head full on. So I broke into my stash but did only like 2 points of very watery looking shots, but nothing like before. For only one day after getting my new vit c I loaded up on it while simultaneously doing my minuscule shots. I once again took about 1200mgs of gabapentin for 2 days in a row. Once again, no signs of detox whatsoever. I kept up with the mega doses of C for a few weeks. I likely could have stopped a bit sooner, but I was terrified of any detox. It was like a magic bullet for me. I never even experienced PAWS.  And definitely no relapses. The rest of my dope I never did.
Sry so long, but I hope my experience helps someone out there in dopesickland."
330,1,"Being clean off opiates is great. But experiencing life at its fullest again, is stressful. Let me explain...

I have been talking to this girl who I REALLY like these past few weeks. It happened naturally, I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlooking‚Äù for anything. 

But the games. The dating games the texting games they get to me. I don‚Äôt know how to handle them. I am a 25 year old dude, decent enough looking I think, and I can‚Äôt stop but fixating on one person when they show me interest...I will elaborate. 

Between waiting hours on end to answer me, to even the next day, it‚Äôs infuriating. It‚Äôs such a trigger for me. To the point where, I‚Äôm not using, but I started to drink tonight because it bothers me so much. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not an alcoholic. I tried, can‚Äôt do it (lol) but the stress, the anxiety it gives me is just tooooo much! My heart palpitates so fast, my mind races. The liquor just numbs it for a little and gives me the confidence to NOT be upset. 

This is the first girl I‚Äôve actually opened up to, in a while. A REALLY long time actually. And she accepts me. I can‚Äôt get over how yeah we are single and she‚Äôs probably talking to other guys. 

Why? Why can‚Äôt I deal with this? I want love. I want it to happen naturally, and this just seemed like it was working. My mind then goes to a million places and then, a day later, she will text me and apologize. 

I get it, people are BUSY, and that‚Äôs cool. But this is a pattern I‚Äôve noticed. Which makes me believe she‚Äôs just doing it on purpose. Chalk it up to playing hard to get or whatever. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just ranting.

342,1,"Hey, I'm addicted to fentanyl. I honestly have no idea how much fent i'm dosing. Been using it for about 7 and a half months now. For the last month I've been trying my best to wean myself off it and I think i've got my tolerance way down. In fact, I took my usual dose last week and then threw up all night so I think that shows it's lower than it used to be. I'm able to take 120mg - 150mg of codeine to remove about 90% of my withdrawals. Does that mean my tolerance is low or high? 120mg of codeine doesn't seem like a lot. 

The first several times I tried to cold turkey the first 2 days of withdrawals were horrible and I couldn't function at all, but now they're not too bad. It still sucks and the symptoms are still there but they're not as crippling, but day 3 is when shit gets absurd and I'm absolutely crippled. I'm guessing that's the 72 hour peak i've read about.

346,1,"Approaching six months off of fentanyl, and it just occurred to me today that my legs are no longer aching 24/7. For several months after quitting I had constant pain in my legs especially around my knees and nothing I did seemed to help. It wasn‚Äôt agony like the withdrawal was, but having that pain nonstop all day every day was driving me literally insane. I was getting to be convinced that I was doomed to hurt for the rest of my life and the thought was so depressing. 

But today it dawned on me that I haven‚Äôt been hurting the last couple of weeks. So much so that I didn‚Äôt even realize, haha. I had nearly forgotten how nice it is to simply not think about your legs!

349,1,"I'm approaching two weeks off fentanyl and I am so apathetic about everything that it's crushing me. Everyone told me it would get better after days 3-7 but I keep feeling more like a sore, depressed zombie. Just feel like a fucking loser posting all the time on the opiates sub asking for help. Had a buddy who was also abusing the fake M30s too, so we connected on here and got sober together. But now that it has been two weeks he is not suffering anymore which makes me feel like my suffering is invalidated. He's such a nice dude but I just feel like I drive everyone away. Social interactions are all forced. Takes so much energy to act normal. When I'm alone all I feel is sadness. It's like all this little shit is building up and getting me. And my girlfriend, dude...fuck. I am so depressed I can't be there for her. It's so unfair to her, she just thinks I'm hella depressed and can't sleep lately. She's super supportive about it but I'm such a piece of shit that I can't tell her. It eats me away but I don't want to tell her about abusing the pills. Everyone in my life tells me I have to tell her and there's no way around it, but I know I just can't. 

Got two more Gabapentins left, but finished all my 20mg of Xanax. The only time I felt close to normal these last 14 days was when I was numb and railed off those two GABAergics. Doctor gave me trazadone cause I haven't gotten more than 4-6hours of sleep a night, but I'm so anxious about priapism that I don't want to take it. My dick gets hard and stays like that randomly all the time without a medication that can cause that side effect. Especially more so now that I'm off the fent. I'll try some otc sleepers tonight. I just don't know if I feel so sore and out of it constantly because of lack of sleep, or just withdrawals. I hope this all ends soon, I want to be sober so bad. But when I get into funks like this I just think how nice it would he to numb myself for the next 50 years of my life with a gross constant cocktail of opiates, benzos and amphetamines. That would be nice. But I keep having to remind myself that I'm kidding myself and dependence is a bitch I have to get over. Man oh man, this sucks."
350,1,I‚Äôve been on methadone for 2 weeks now and up to 70mg. I stopped using completely thanks to methadone but I want to stop the methadone now.

I know taking kratom didn‚Äôt touch my fent withdrawals at all but I just don‚Äôt like the way the methadone is making me feel. I just want my normal life back.
351,1,"A little background. I'm 19F and have been into opiates/opioids/benzos for about 7 years now. My last run was IV meth/heroin (goofballs) multiple times a day for around 6 months.

Then I got clean for a hot minute, then started using kratom, then PST, doing up to 4 pounds a day (it was a lot). 

Jump to September 2019 and I hop onto subs and have been on them since. I've got about 5 and a half months under me and have been doing really really well. I'm pretty happy, not depressed, and putting my life back together. Got on the right meds and am excited for the future.

Yet for some reason, the past few days I can't stop thinking about using. I'm not trying to numb anything, which is the usual reason I would get cravings. No, I'm doing great, yet I can't get it out of my head. It's like I miss the good feeling, and it's getting to the point where it's almost visceral and I've tried distracting myself. But it always comes back, or it sticks in the back of my head, creeping in the background.

I've never meant anything more than when I say this: I DON'T want to use. I *know* it would just lead to devastation. I can't go back to where I was. Never. Again. This is different from before. Before, I would get a craving and I was half-hearted with my attempts to get clean so there wasn't much resistance to fight it. But now, I *hate* having these cravings. I want nothing more for them to go away. I've never had such strong cravings while being so incredibly opposed to them. It's really bewildering, especially since I'm not depressed. I heard after like 4-8 months, cravings come back. Maybe this is it for me? I just want the obsessive thoughts to stop.


I know that if they stay this strong, I'll crumble. If it doesn't end soon, I know I'll give in and mentally relapse. And then its all over. So I can't. I don't want to. I'm just so confused, why this is so hard, if I'm so against it? What do I do? What do you do? Is this normal? Has this happened to anyone else like this? How do I get through this?"
352,1,"I had been 7 months clean off dope and 3 months almost off of suboxone. This past week I relapsed on IV heroin. 

I‚Äôm ashamed of myself and I‚Äôm scared of how ashamed I‚Äôll really be once in no longer high and run out of what I have. I already spent too much money. 

It‚Äôs weird I was doing so so good and not having any problems. Then 2 weeks ago depression (which I take meds for) and anxiety came rushing back... thankfully i should be able to get back on track

354,1,"Currently at the car dealership having them replace my brakes and lights. Got plenty of stuff to entertain myself so I don't think it will be too bad. Forgot to close pornhub last night so that came up on my screen when I opened my laptop in the middle of this lobby. Not sure if anyone saw it but it gave me a good laugh. Also the guy that took all of my car information is definitely high on something. Eyes pinned really bad and hes completely sweaty even though it's not hot at all. Then I handed him my keys that have the NA key tags on them. I wonder if he knows that I know. Oh well, hope he can get help."

356,1,"On Monday I go to get my first dose of daily methadone. I'm very familiar with opiates in general (heroin, fentanyl, etc.). My question is - can methadone put you in precipitated withdrawals like suboxone or subutex (I think no, but...)? I have taken those before (I've had almost every kind, really). You have to wait to take your first dose with those  two so you don't throw yourself into precipitated withdrawals. Does the same apply for methadone? I searched and browed for this question/an answer, but I found nothing. I understand agonists and receptors, also. Can someone help shed some light on this/tell me some experiences with methadone, please?"
357,1,"Im 31 years old, i abused tramadol fotalmost 8-9 years..over the year i have tried to giving up onmy addiction but i would never actually been able to go further 7 days due to those tormenting withdrawal effects. But this time i wan end this damnation once and for all. Yet being 3 days without it, i feel like im loosing the battle. Yet im here lying on bed, convulsing, rolling, putting head beneath my pillow in sheer hope to just be able to fall asleep. needles to day day long suffering, restlessness, anxiety, chills and goosebumps, runny nose and mild diarrhea.. Seems like all hell has broke loose on me yet clinging on to hope there will be joy and light in the other side which seem promosing. Im in worst possible state of withdrawal effects. As im laying and typing my salvation here. I envy others who are lucky enough to have a normal life and sleep like babies in the night withou any dread and guild in the life. I want to be normal again, I want to feel true happiness again like everyday normal people and chase after years lost dreams and ambition. I want to make up for my parents whom i've caused so much pain and disgrace over the years, yet they arevery supportive for me.. I would like to know how others have been coping with it, struggling to stay clean. once i had read a quote ""Walk seven years into the woods it takes 7 years to walk out"". Seem so fking true now.

I want to be normal again. Thanks!"
359,1,"I never thought it was even possible to be this far along. In the past 9 weeks I went to rehab, started seeing a therapist, tried some new meds (didn‚Äôt work) and started my new job. It is a weird thing experiencing life without opiates. I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself. 

I learned I feel the need to have a substance to be happy. For example I TRIED replacing opiates with alcohol. I guess I don‚Äôt have the alcohol gene in me, after one week I was done. Just sick even thinking of it.

I realized I want love, and deserve love! But I‚Äôm rushing it. I want so badly to find someone to spend my life with now that I have ambition and desire again. I love being in love, but I‚Äôve tried to hard to rush it. I need to be more patient, which is something else I‚Äôm working on.

I learned I don‚Äôt know if I have ‚Äútrue depression‚Äù I think I was numbing myself for so long with opiates THAT was why I was upset. But I kind of like this normal, sober life without serequel or lexapro or Wellbutrin. It‚Äôs just not for me!

I learned I love work. I love being dedicated to a job I am passionate about. It gives me purpose. Getting up every morning to go to my new job that people rely on me for, it‚Äôs beyond words.

Lastly, I learned that I love myself, and I love being healthy and happy. I hope whoever sees this, no matter what stage you are in along this process of getting clean, you can do it. It gets better. Maybe not tonight or tomorrow but 6...7 weeks later you will wake up and think why you ever put yourself through that torture. Have a great weekend, ya‚Äôll."
360,1,"This Friday I start a new attempt at quiting; I should be feeling symptoms 12 hours from now. 

The last 7 times or so that I've tried to quit, I've had comfort meds. I'm lucky enough that I found a pharmacy that is willing to sell Gabapentin, Clonidine and Seroquel without prescription. In those withdrawals it was easier, yes, but the mental parts still got to me and I relapsed. Using those meds the physical symptoms were very low, but the anxiety and cravings were still there, in fact two days ago I was withdrawing before I relapsed yet again. This Friday begins a new attempt. 

Did you guys have comfort meds during WD's? What did you do during that time? Sleep, or did you manage to somehow do stuff other than lie in bed all day? I've heard of people watching TV to do something, I might try that myself."
361,1,"A little background, I‚Äôm a 22 year old male that has struggled with some sort of drug addiction since the first time I smoked weed around age 12-13 maybe earlier. I escalated very quickly to stealing pills from my friends bathroom cabinets in middle school, selling my video games to buy promethazine w/ codeine, and many more things I‚Äôd rather not share.

I very quickly fucked up my entire life up until that point and was forced to do an outpatient program which did help me to quit my 5 year opiate addiction. Since then, I have quit all hard drugs, but am a heavy weed smoker and have been using it pretty much constantly for as long as I could remember. It‚Äôs negatively effecting my mental health issues and my personal life and I really want to quit but every time I do, it makes me want to go back to popping pills and that scares the shit out of me. 

I know the person I become on opiates and I‚Äôve grown to hate that person, but I can‚Äôt help but crave it in my bones when I don‚Äôt have another substance to keep my mind busy. It‚Äôs been 3 years since I‚Äôve gotten off any hard drugs besides marijuana but it still feels like I just quit pills less than a week ago. Ive been realIy struggling with my depression/suicidal tendencies as I always knew I could just take 1 too many oxys and it‚Äôll all be over, just internal peace forever. I know I can‚Äôt go back to my old ways but part of me just wants to give up on everything and embrace it. Does it ever get easier? Feel free to share advice, not looking for anything specifically just writing down my thoughts for the most part"
364,1,"I had started using oxys 5 years ago and then switched to subs. After a relapse I went on 160 mg methadone treatment for 8 months. Today is day 5 cold turkey and besides the explosive shits I'm feeling relatively fine. A little lethargic. 

Reading other people stories this doesn't seem normal. Is this possible?"
365,1,Does anyone have any experience with zophran? I know it def helps with stomach issues and things with detox but I also heard it was dealing with serotonin as well. Was just wondering if anyone has used this for detox as a stand alone and what their experience is with it
366,1,"Well I‚Äôm trying again. I‚Äôve been trying on and off since December. Every time I‚Äôve been trying I‚Äôve tried cold turkey and end up relapsing due to the low energy. I work full time and can not afford to call off work. 

By the way I abuse the fent pressed m30s through nasally snorting them. In my worst I was snorting at least 2 sometimes up to 4-5 per day. 

I recently decided that maybe if I try to be really self disciplined with a taper, I can suffer through very mild withdraw symptoms over a longer course of time, rather then debilitating symptoms. For me I can barely get out of bed for almost a week and then still have 0 motivation or energy for another week. At the end of 2 weeks I still only feel maybe 70% and end up relapsing. 

I started my taper 2 days ago. It‚Äôs been like this so far. 

I snorted one 2 days ago. Woke up at 6:30am feeling great, by the end of the day when I get home around 6 I started to feel pretty bad withdraws. I snorted only a half. I woke up this morning feeling pretty shitty. I snorted a quarter. I‚Äôm gonna go as long as I can without doing any, and when I do, only snort maybe a quarter or less. I‚Äôm gonna try and extend the time as long as possible, and on the weekends just suffer through it. 

Do you think this is possible/will help? Can I eventually drag it out so much that the wd from stopping wont be debilitating? 

I really don‚Äôt want to go to a doctor, I can‚Äôt afford to miss work, and I don‚Äôt want to just get addicted to subs."
367,1,"Just out of general curiosity; I‚Äôm wondering how fast everyone tapered off their methadone without getting nasty withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôve been staying the course of dropping down 5mgs a month for the past year now, and just got down to 20mg, and the pharmacist expressed concerns that going from 25mg to 20mg was too much of a jump and wants me to starts doing 2.5mg from now on - how did y‚Äôall taper down?"
368,1,"Last Sunday morning around 9:30am I woke up, and took my last hit of Fentanyl (smoking it). It was as early as 4 or 5pm that afternoon that I began to feel awful withdraw symptoms. Major anxiety, cold/hot flashes, and this awful feeling in my muscles (which I consider the worst part) where I can‚Äôt sit/lay still for very long without spazzing out. Or feeling like I want to jump out of my skin. This has kept me awake for the majority of the time since Sunday. I‚Äôve read all over the Internet on different options to alleviate these symptoms, but I‚Äôm curious... can this be done cold turkey? Am I foolish to think it‚Äôll go away on its own? It‚Äôs been multiple days and it‚Äôs hardly getting better."

372,1,"Hello, first time posting in this sub.. 
I never thought I would have made it this far. I know my addiction isn‚Äôt as serious as others on this sub, but I saw myself slipping into this dark hole the past couple months with my depression and started doing more and more. I saw myself slipping to the point where I saw myself overdosing like I did 3 years ago. It wasn‚Äôt for fun anymore, or things to distract myself with. I was fully dependent on it, doing 30mg Roxis 3-7 a day. (Nasal) And man, I was so scared to finally go cold turkey. The withdrawals suck, day 1 was the worst. I wanted to just say fuck it I‚Äôll do it another day and just get some more. But I told myself to stick it out, Day 2 was hell, but I felt better with some light exercise and comfort meds like Xanax. Now I‚Äôm on Day 3, and I feel somewhat okay. I know I still got a little ways to go, but I never thought I‚Äôd get this far or even find the courage to start. I‚Äôm not really sure where I‚Äôm going with this post, but I‚Äôm finally starting to think I can do this. I can live a life without this. I wanna see how long I can go on this break I have planned. Thanks for listening? (If you did.) I‚Äôll keep checking back in every now and then. But Day 3, you will be conquered!!"
373,1,"I recently learned of a Vit C protocol to help alleviate opioid withdrawals.  I haven't been able to find anyone who has tried it and thought I would post here to see if any of you may have experimented with this (or may want to and report back).  You can obtain the Vit C powder from health food stores, making sure it's sodium ascorbate.  

Here is the protocol and the associated [journal article](https://www.isom.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Attenuation-of-Heroin-Withdrawl-Syndrome-by-the-Administration-of-High-Dose-Vitamin-C-27.4.pdf) it was taken from. 

*  Day-One (three days prior to day of withdrawal): Drink six ounces diluted fruit juice (DFJ) containing 500-1000 mg of sodium ascorbate (SA) every two hours until bedtime. 
*  Day-Two: Drink DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg of SA every two hours until bedtime. 
* Day-Three: Drink DFJ with 5,000-7,500 mg SA every three hours until bedtime. Begin withdrawal at bedtime. If withdrawal symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 5000- 7500 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate.  
* Day-Four: DFJ with 2,500-5,000 mg SA every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 2500-5000 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Five: DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg SA every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 1,000-2,500 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate. 
* Day-Six: DFJ with 1,000 mg SA every two hours until bedtime. If symptoms occur during the night, DFJ with 1,000 mg SA, administered when awake, and taken every two hours until symptoms abate"

381,1,"I've been clean since 2015 off dilly methadone hydros and xanax(all of that at once in varying cocktails)

Had some codeine and hydrocodone prescribed for a really bad tooth problem that required root canal. I took them as prescribed and the first night I did get buzzed but I didn't enjoy it. It felt like a malaise. Sluggish bored nauseous and eventually passed out. I continued to take them as prescribed for one week when the pain got bad and now they're gone. I had no desire for more. This was about 1.5 months ago. 

Maybe it's an age thing or maybe I'm so far removed from that lifestyle but it felt very foreign. I guess that's my good news for some of you. Some day it will just feel foreign."
383,1,"Really could use some advice I'm so freaking scared of the person I have become. A little background about myself 
I'm 27 yo married with 2 kids
Had an okay childhood so I thought it was normal but now being an adult realize it wasn't. Parents always partied drinking/drugs but they were good parents as in we always had a home and things we needed. In high school I thought I was the cool kid because parents let me have parties and my house was the ""fun"" house. Then some bad shit happened to me got pregnant at 14 gave birth at 15. Parents helped me out graduated on time thought I was doing good. Thought I was the only ""normal"" one out of my family that graduated hs got licensed to do something I loved. 

Fast forward to today and I'm addicted to pills mostly pain pills like hydrocodone and percocet but I take adderall exos anything to not be sober. I'm so fucking disgusted with mysel. I don't know how I could be so naive to not realize what I was getting myself into. At first for a while I could take half of a 10mg loratab and feel so good now it's about 5 at one time. The other day I took about 7 percocets and¬† 60 mg of adderall through out the day and puked when I got home to finally eat something and just cried because of the person I have become. I used to have decent things and take my kids to do fun things and have money saved. What hurts the most is I'm putting my drug habit before my family I have no problem spending $120 on pills to last a couple of days but I'm scraping up money for my kids book fair. I literally HATE myself. I try to talk to my husband but he doesn't know the extent of my habit and doesn't really understand he say well just stop. It's not that easy my job requires me to be around people and making them happy. At first taking these pills I thought they helped me make better tips because I was this happy nice talkative person. Now I have pills on my mind constantly on how I'm going to get them or who has any and I'm so fed up with this. I don't know how to function without I don't know if i should quit my job so I won't have the money for it or if that will make me more depressed and miserable. I have no one to talk to no support. I'm so scared. I have kratom but I don't know if I'm dosing right because i still have awful anxiety when I try to use it I want it to work for me so bad I read amazing stories on how it's a miracle I know they say not to expect to get high or anything like that I just want it to help me function at work to not feel like such a peice of shit. 

Sorry for the long post been wanting to post for a while on here. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm so exhausted from this shit. I feel like I don't love anything or anyone anymore and that kills me I'm terrified at feeling this way when I admit I've been choosing drugs over my family but my brain won't let me win sometimes I just want to fall asleep and not ever wake up."
384,1,"I just left the probation department substance abuse adviser... I was clean for 3 years up until 6 months ago. I relapsed and went on a 10 day run then got clean. Then 30 days ago I went on a pressed fentanyl 30s then switched to BTH (with fent I am assuming) I'm doing between 1/2 - 1 gram daily.

The probation department adviser set me up for counseling to start next week after detoxing. But for the detox they gave me a couple options. 

Option 1: Go to a detox (dont have a free one in my area so I will have to pay and I can't afford)

Option 2: Go to methadone clinic ( I don't want to get hooked on methadone and the advisor knows this so I told them I would only go for a few days.)

Option 3: Go to suboxone clinic ( I don't want to get hooked on suboxone the advisor knows this as well so I would only take suboxone for a few days.)

So between option 2 &amp; 3 which is the best route to take for only a couple days? 
I know with methadone clinic starts off at small doses but might help me quit methadone after 4 days. 
I know with suboxone clinic I have a very good chance of getting PWDs. 

P.S. I have 7 Xanex bars to help me with WDs too.

Please help me with the best game plan for Detox. I have the post detox under control. Thanks."

Fast forward 11 years to this past november - one of my family members had a big surgery and was prescribed percocet. I would steal a couple every now and then, but it reignited my love of the drug. I soon texted a contact that I thought might have some, and he did. Since last november, I took about 6-8 10/325's a day until just this past weekend when I knew enough was enough.

Right before I decided to quit I tried H a few times, and the dealer admitted there‚Äôs fentanyl in it. 

Even after 24 hours I was sent into precipitated withdrawals. 

The next time around I did very small dosing of subs until I felt decent. I‚Äôm approaching 48 hours. I can take Half sub strips and not get sick, but I still don‚Äôt feel as normal as I used to be. I get occasional sweats here and there and I have no energy.

396,1,"I sit here not only extremely weak and sick, but extremely ashamed and livid with myself for allowing myself to sucome to this disease again. I would be just now falling asleep from a night of celebration and congratulations to a year clean and sober, but instead I lie here shaking like a fish out of water, unable to keep my body at a stable temperature, unable to hold still for 30 seconds, unable to sleep except right after vomiting, just to wake up with every inch on my body hurting to limp to the bathroom and do it all again. Grown men are not supposed to shit themselves for any reason and yet I do it everytime I vomit. Don't have the energy to bathe so I lay in the shower as the water does the work I cannot. Did this happen overnight? Absolutely not. It all started as a troubled and naive 16 year old fresh into high school, smoked weed a few times and was absolutely in love with it, why? I'm a bi polar schizophrenk and for me the pot did what the meds couldn't quite do. No, due to my parents intellect they never allowed the doctors to provide me anything highly addictive, but I find xanax on my own. I was introduced to the little pill of pain at 16 years old in the lunch room of my high school, a boy had stolen his mothers prescription after his older brother hyped up the drug. For me, it lived up to all the hype. A drug to wipe my anxiety and not give a fuck who you are or what j think you're thinking? Sign me up for good. That was the beginning. After 2 years of heavy addiction starting at 17 I cannot remember a single moment of my junior or senior year of high school. I then had my wisdom teeth surgery and was introduced to opiates which was even more of a BINGO moment for me, the euphoria and energy I would receive in the beginning was a feeling of complete nirvana. I began with perc 30s and eventually progressed to fentanyl after dealing dog food for quite some time. Introduced as a money maker I fell in love ASAP and ran with it....until I found myself at 21 living under a bridge with nothing to my name but the clothes I had on and a half gram of fentanyl, at that moment I did all.i had left and went to rehab. On the 28th of February I should've celebrated 1 year clean, instead, I relapsed on valentines day of 2020 and I now sit here March 3rd after a heart attack yesterday morning from not taking any other medications of mine after being on them for 10 years besides 330mg of oxycodone. I am now back at home and seeking detox and treatment and believe I have found a bed come Thursday. I had been on suboxone and decided to get off it early and even after suffering through those excruciating withdrawals the opiates sang to me like the sirens in Greek mythology and I couldnt turn away
 I do not know why I am posting this maybe I just needed to talk to myself or what but my mind is a jumbled mess so I will not be proof reading any of this I just need whoever is going through the same thing that as long as your heart is beating the fight ain't over yet"
397,1,"I have been clean for about a month and I'm so bored. I don't want to ever use opiates again but I'm having the strongest urge to hit up my coke connect because I can't feel ANYTHING but extreme, all consuming boredom. Never had a problem with coke like I did with opiates (experimented casually but I'm 100% an addict at heart) but goddamn am I so bored, I want to feel anything. My finances are getting better, my life is manageable, my house is clean and organized, so many things are going well and all I can think about is getting any sort of high for relief from this terrible boredom. I'm so mad at myself and my brain! Is this PAWS?"
398,1,"I am planning on being completu off suboxone in 10 days and heroin in 4 days...  is the bernise method possible to pee clean in 10 days from heroin using this method??? Please answer that.

Then please break down the bernise method for me whether the above is possible or not. Thanks."
399,1,The latest video on my channel is about a good friend who died tragically during a drug binge. It was tough to make. I hope you all enjoy it. Thanks so much for watching.
400,1,"I just wanted to share that I got off of opiates two years ago and did Neurorecover IVs for a few days and had no PAWS.
Unfortunately I‚Äôm on opiates again due to a severe injury and I plan to do Neurorecover again when I wean. 
I needed to share because I see so many people suffering. I did Neurorecover in San Diego."
401,1,"So I am a chronic pain patient that has to use opiates for pain because all the other stuff doesn't work well enough to manage the pain. I have been taking 1 Tylenol #3 for about 5 months a couple of times a week at night and it used to work great for pain. It stopped working for my pain so my doc moved me up to 2 hydrocodone 5mg a day saying it's okay to use up to 3 a day if the pain is bad but only a max of 60 pills a month before my back surgery. I have been taking about 2 hydros a day a couple times a week but I'm worried it's no longer gonna be enough and my doc is gonna leave me out to dry. Currently am on my 6th day as part of a self-imposed tolerance break (the last dose was 2.5mg hydro February 25th and the day before I took 1.5 5mg hydro). I have been taking Agmatine 1000mg twice a day to help reduce the tolerance for a couple of days now and plan to take it before my dosage when I start again. I was wondering how long yall think before my tolerance gets cut by about 50%. I also take Cymbalta, 3000mg Tylenol, 200mg Lyrica, 4mg Zanaflex 3 times daily, and sometimes lorazepam .5mg or Klonopin .5mg for pain/muscle spasms/anxiety. The pain has been so much and I don't think I can last longer than a week (I originally planned 3 days), but I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms except I'm in so much pain I just want to give in and take the hydro. I have access to 62 Tylenol #3 and like 50 tramadol's but I hate the side effects of those. Only thing is I don't want to do anything illegal or take anything else that may interact with my medications since I take so much.

Also, If anyone has advice I've been having this problem with hydros. I would get quite high on 10mg of hydro but still be in bad pain sometimes. Getting high makes me anxious so I didn't wanna take more any tips?

TLDR: Took 1 tylenol #3 3-4 times weekly for 5 months, then 2 Hydros 5mg daily for 2-3 months 4 times weekly. On day 6, is 1 week enough for a 50% tolerance reduction, or do I need more time? Also just started Agmatine for around 2 days to help counteract tolerance."
403,1,"I lied to the only People, my parents, who care about me, that I am okay. I am not okay. I can‚Äôt stop drinking. I hate this addiction disease."
404,1,I was clean for 3 years until a couple of months I slipped up on these fentanyl pressed 30's. The worst thing to ever happen to the opiate world but that's about a 100+ page post for another day. Anyways about 2 weeks ago I tried to wait 36 hours then took half an 8mg strip I got from a buddy. Bam PWDs at there greatest. Right back on the pills until I felt normal again. So then I switch to some BTH for 10 days wait 12 hours snort a xanax bar sleep 24 hours straight and then take half an 8mg strip. Bam PWDs not as bad but still bad. So go back to shooting BTH. So I call my doctor who can prescribe methadone. My idea is to take 3-5 days of methadone slowly weaning down. Of course He disagrees... he wants me to take clonidine for 48 hours then give me a week worth of buprenorphine alone with out naloxone. Then wean me down the following week with suboxone. So 1 week buprenorphine and 1 week suboxone. I want anyone opinion on my doctors idea? I still think my methadone and clonidine idea is better but I'm no doctor and I have been outta the game for 3 years. Thanks ahead of time for you help

 Abstract

This UG3/UH3 project will develop vaccines against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds as a strategy to reduce illicit opioid use and the incidence of fatal overdoses. Proposed activities will include lead vaccine selection and optimization, manufacturing of GMP vaccines, and IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies. The US has seen dramatic increases in fatal overdoses due to heroin, counterfeit prescription drugs, and cocaine adulterated with fentanyl or fentanyl-like analogs. Current medications may not be sufficient to address the opioid overdose epidemic. As a complementary strategy to current medications, we will develop vaccines against fentanyl and fentanyl-like compounds to reduce their abuse liability and lethality. Our team has already developed vaccines against heroin and oxycodone that induce antibodies effective in reducing opioid distribution to the brain, opioid-induced behaviors, and opioid-induced respiratory depression. Vaccines effectively and selectively target the intended opioid but do not interfere with endogenous opioids nor with approved pharmacotherapies. Opioid vaccines offer a long-lasting, safe and cost-effective intervention complementary to medication assisted treatment (MAT). Vaccines may reduce overdoses in opioid users as well as protect those in professions (e.g., law enforcement, airport security, postal workers) at risk of accidental exposure to fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Our team has identified a candidate fentanyl vaccine consisting of a fentanyl-based hapten (F0) conjugated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein, and adsorbed onto alum adjuvant. Immunization with F0-KLH reduces fentanyl distribution to the brain, and selectively reduces fentanyl-induced antinociception and respiratory depression in rats. We will further optimize the lead F0-KLH by testing alternative carrier proteins. In parallel we will develop other conjugate vaccines containing a new series of haptens (Fn) to target carfentanil, remifentanil, and other fentanyl analogs. Development will be staggered across UG3/UH3 phases, and we expect that the first lead F0-carrier conjugate vaccine will be ready for IND filing by the end of Year 3.
AIM1 focuses on optimization of vaccines containing the lead F0 and new Fn haptens conjugated to industry-standard carrier proteins, including two E. coli-expressed carriers obtained from our industry partner FinaBiosolutions. Leads are identified for efficacy in inducing antibodies that will reduce fentanyl (or fentanyl analog) distribution to the brain as well as reducing antinociception, respiratory depression and lethality in rats.
AIM1 also characterizes additional immunization regimens and vaccine efficacy in fentanyl self-administration rat models. As a contingency plan, AIM2 tests whether AIM1 leads containing F0 and Fn haptens can be co-administered in a multicomponent vaccine formulation to simultaneously target fentanyl and its analogs.
AIM3 focuses on manufacturing of GMP vaccines and evaluate their safety in GLP pre-clinical toxicology studies through CMO and CRO partners.
AIM3 will then file an IND for at least one vaccine formulation against fentanyl and/or its analogs.

407,1,"So I‚Äôve been loosing weight, &amp; would like to get my hunger back. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? I‚Äôm not in an area with Vivitrol, which I would much rather prefer. Until I can find a doctor that deals with Vivitrol, I‚Äôd appreciate any information!"
408,1,"Been PMSing...or I should say PMDDing for a few days now. The waves of cramps every few hours are unbelievable painful. I'm having such a hard time just sticking to my usual 20 mg dosage. I was hoping I'd be lower by now...but I don't get much time. I'm almost out of gabapentin again. Refill in 2 weeks. My mom can probably help me with it, but not my usual daily dose. Probably half that or less. Idk. I'm bummed. I wanted to be so much further than I am now. And I'm finding it so hard not to reach for another painkiller when I'm in so much pain virtually all the time. I don't want the drugs. But I don't want to be in pain either. And I'm tired. So tired."
409,1,Had 36 days free from a 13 year opiate run. Last week my chronic back pain came back with a vengeance so in a weak moment I got 70 hydros 5/325. I took between 4-8 a day for the last week. Was 36 days without it! Am i gonna have full withdrawal again? I‚Äôm feeling like shit and haven‚Äôt taken a hydro now in about 20 hours. Man I fucked up. Will this go around be shorter in wd since i had almost six weeks clean??
410,1,So my gf and I have been together for about 7 years.  It's been rough but also amazing at times.  She's transformed as a person now into the perfect gf.  She stuck by me through my addiction.  Now that I'm clean we've been communicating very well.  Well I've been clean about 2 months and I'm a full-time student and broke and just getting on my feet and she tells me she has to move in two months and I need to either move in with her or she's going to her friends across the country bc she can't afford rent here.  I'd need to leave all my support structure and move right around finals week.  My gut is telling me it's a bad move and to keep doing what's working for now but I feel I owe it to her to try otherwise I feel like I'm the dick here.  I love her but I'm not totally in love with her yet as we have alot of baggage to work through.  I was abused as a child though and list my virginity in a non consensual way and I've never been able to open up to anyone and build an intimiate relationship before I've always just slept around and left before I caught feelings.  I'm scared I'll never find someone again. I want to just disapear and use but instead I have to pretty much break up with her after the gym today. I'm going to a meeting with my sponsor tonight.  I wish this could of happened when I was using and had a way to numb it.
412,1,"We used to get high together. 10 years ago I started Suboxone and she started heroin. Now she has 5 years clean and I‚Äôm struggling to taper off the subs. It‚Äôs amazing we were able to pick up where we left off. I plan on joining one of her meetings tonight. 

I asked her ‚Äúwhat made you use heroin‚Äù, she said she couldn‚Äôt get subs anymore. She said the doc was prescribing benzos and she started taking anything within reach. One thing led to another and she let a guy shoot her up. It wasn‚Äôt always easy to get h so she would smoke crack. She lost everything.. her kids, her car and had a broken heart. 

I wish she would have reached out then, I could‚Äôve helped her. Perhaps she needed this to happen. I don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôs doing better than me emotionally. I‚Äôm thankful she‚Äôs willing to help me now. She‚Äôs doing great. It gave me hope. Someone could lose far more than you, start with much less and still be much happier in a position to help. 

There‚Äôs power in positivity."
413,1,Time to get back into routine
414,1,"The weather was fantastic today so I pulled out my bike and aired up the tires. During the ride I had two realizations one about seat height the other about unclipping and clipping in the cleats. The seat height was no big deal to adjust so I raised it up which took the pressure out of my knees. I had been feeling cramped up and pain in my right knee and couldn't figure out why until it dawned on me that it needed adjusting. Secondly, but most importantly the cleats. I had been unclipping the hard-way which I learned by myself and thought was the right way turning the ankle outward instead of inward.

My cleat un-clipping was reactionary and even fear driven at times, and I noticed that I would ride with my heal turned outward putting strain on my tendons. When learning to ride last year I taught myself to ride like this after all the falls and tumbles. There was an easier way and that is to turn your heel inwards, not in a reactionary way out of fear instead in a proactive manner with skill.

Learning the proper use of my bicycle cleats and riding stance has made me a better rider, and it has brought awareness to other areas of my life. My opioid habit was reactionary, I had taught myself to cope with life with substances. I am learning and living a better life now with lots of cushion and smiles! I do however choose to remain vigilant for fear could bring up old habits. I know how to properly unclip, but if a runaway car crosses my path will it cause to regress on old habits. Eyes open, fully aware, feeling, these are the ways I choose to be.

Side-note

Reading another post brought to my attention that I too have quite the amount of pent up sexual emotions. I have remained clear of relationships while rebuilding my life and this spring I intend to start building those again. I want to be involved, a good provider, a father, but I have had to clear so much from my life to even try. This year I graduate parole, this year I pay off all remaining debt, this year I love again."
415,1,"I start my new job tomorrow. Very excited about it. Very scared that this past week I drank 5/7 days. That is, obviously concerning. It‚Äôs funny ya know, always told myself outta rehab ‚Äúwell shit I don‚Äôt have an alcohol problem‚Äù I‚Äôll be damned if alcohol ain‚Äôt a great drug too I‚Äôve been boozing hard lately. Hopefully it stops this week. I think a big part of me wanting to even drink is my anxiety for this job. Anyways, 62 days off dope. That‚Äôs cool, but fuck my brain and it‚Äôs tendencies to deal with stuff."
416,1,"Went to that memorial yesterday and it was wild to say the least. The sister of the deceased gave a speech and declared that she was 5 years sober and that addiction isn't a disease. As soon as she finished her speech she chugged a beer and took a shot of liquor. It was truly a bizarre scene. 

The last thing I want is to have people celebrate my life prematurely like that. Glad to be where I am today."
417,1,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/f05fh8/bf_relapsed_again_except_this_time_we_live/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Tl;dr: bf relapsed on meth after 2y8m clean, but at least he admitted it within a few days and didn't use opiates.

Update: he overdosed on heroin 2 weeks ago the day of his dad's wake while I was on the way to meet him out of state for the funeral. Since then, he's used heroin and meth multiple times and we've thrown away ""the last"" of his works 3 times. I went through his phone early this morning because he's continually gone back on his commitments to go to a meeting and talk to his recovery friends. I found that he picked up again yesterday and solid evidence that he had sex with at least 1 dealer when he first relapsed, but it seems that there were more guys that he hooked up with besides that one.

I'm lost. I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do other than go to my therapy intake this week.

I want to support his recovery because I know what he's like when he's clean, but it doesn't seem like he wants that right now. I'm scared of what will happen if I kick him out...or if I even CAN kick him out. What are some of the best things a partner can do at this point?"
418,1,Today is day 2. All of my withdrawls symptoms seem to be emotional. I'm having a very hard time today. I'm at work for the next 12 hrs. I was taking 120mg once a day at my height. Been abusing for 4 to 5 months. I have e kratom and vitamins. Kratom has been helping but I'm just soo emotional and full of anxiety. I just need some words of encouragement. I feel deflated. I'm hoping the wothrmdrawl doesnt get worse. I have zero physical withdrawl and zero urges to take oxy. I really wanna stop. Can somebody please just give me some advice. I'm doing this all alone
422,1,"So I don‚Äôt know why I relapsed again (hydrocodone 10 mg) I was fine ,I was clean for 2 months off this shit,only relapsed for 3 days back in mid February and now again for the last 5 or 6 days taking like 3 ,10 mg hydros a day,I used to take like 10 or 12 of them a day..I took the last 2 this morning ,all my symptoms except being tired all the time was over with,I didn‚Äôt really have cravings anymore and started sleeping normal so I don‚Äôt know why I did it...BUT can someone who‚Äôs been through it and knows from experience WILL I HAVE WITHDRAWAL from this? I didn‚Äôt have no withdrawal symptoms when I relapsed earlier this month for those 3 days but now I‚Äôm scared because it was more mgs and for a longer amount of days"
423,1,"Need to vent. Over the last couple of months I've tried marijuana for the first time after having been addicted to opioids for about 2 years following a major surgery removing an organ and a half + 3 other surgeries.... 

I decided to try marijuana to help with pain. It was horrible. I've tried so many different combinations of thc/CBD and method of intake but it doesn't help. I also have a bad reaction about 50% of the time and feel like I'm living in a nightmare world.

What I'm struggling with is convincing myself the opioids are bad. They never made me feel that way. They took away the pain. I could function. I didn't feel out of my mind terrified like the marijuana. Yeah the opioids will kill me eventually from liver failure or something but isn't that my choice to make? To me the positive of the opioids is outweighing the negative.... Which I know is a horrible thing to be thinking and I need to stop it. Why is this so hard?"
424,1,Hello
426,1,"I‚Äôve been an addict for the majority of my life, and all of my adult life... Im 38 now and have been using heroin since I was 17. I have detoxed many times with many methods over the course of those years. I‚Äôve done the methadone thing many times, and getting off that was worse than the H. Then my doctor prescribed me Suboxone, which I was on for almost 3 years before relapsing again. Had a very hard time trying to get off that and figured I‚Äôd be on it the rest of my life unless I went back to H for a while to get off the subs, thinking it would be easier to quit. Relapsed almost a year ago and have tried to get clean several times since. My plan was to use the subs only to get through the worst part of the H detox and then be clean off everything. Thing is, I can‚Äôt seem to make it past the induction period this time. Every time I take the subs, no matter how sick I am and how long I‚Äôve waited since my last use, I go into precipitated withdrawals and it‚Äôs a nightmare! I‚Äôm wondering if the H I have has fentanyl in it? How do I know if it does? Any characteristics that I would be able to tell by taste, smell, or how it looks? I can‚Äôt figure out why it‚Äôs been so hard for me to switch over this time around. I‚Äôd really like to get through this detox and I‚Äôve tried at least once a week for the past 5 months. You can imagine the toll that‚Äôs taken on my mind and body by now. But I refuse to give up. I‚Äôd try anything at this point. Been looking into kratom as well, and tried that the last 2 weekends with no success and I‚Äôm about to try again tomorrow morning unless someone has a better suggestion? I don‚Äôt know what to do here and I‚Äôm exhausted from this and just want to be done. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!"
427,1,"Feeling down but not really sick. I have been in this bad cycle of scoring &amp; going on a 2 week binge &amp; then chilling for 2 weeks while I wait for my plug to get their refill. It‚Äôs good because I don‚Äôt build a really big tolerance and so next time I score it‚Äôs pretty great. It also keeps me from going through serious withdrawals because I usually taper off the last couple of days. 

This last time I went through my entire stash in 10 days, smh. I also want it to be my last time. I need to stop wasting money on it. It‚Äôs crazy how much more I‚Äôd have saved up right now if I didn‚Äôt spend it on drugs. And so I‚Äôve decided I need to quit. 

Right now I feel like i won‚Äôt make it. Like being sober is too fucking boring. For me it‚Äôs not about not being able to make myself stop. It‚Äôs about how painfully boring life is without it. I also don‚Äôt want to replace it with something else which is what I‚Äôve basically done my entire life. I want to stop drinking too. I want to feel happy and be able to let loose without needing to alter my mind. 

I‚Äôm ready to try or do anything to get to a good place. I‚Äôm going to try taking the anti depressants they recommended and start working out and eating right. I just really hope something works because otherwise what‚Äôs the point."

*brave enough*

finished the last of my heroin not too long ago. the cravings are already kicking in. 

fuck. *fuckfuckfuckfuck*

no easy way out. stuck in my broken down car with, like, 35 cents to my name. idk how i've managed to completely decimate my life YET A-FUCKING-GAIN and i feel so ashamed and sad and angry and helpless and sad. so, so, so sad.

thankfully i broke down at my gym, so i can shower and use the bathroom and be indoors at night, 'cause there ain't no way in hell i'm going to be able to sleep tonight....

yes, the physical part of withdrawal fucking sucks but the mental bullshit... the crippling depression and self-pity and the OVERWHELMING desire to use *just one last time* is what does me in every time...

my dad is thankfully coming out to hopefully fix my little car tomorrow... at least he hasn't totally written off his junkie daughter...

guys, please, i implore you to tell me how awful heroin is and how i'm better without it... i know that shit to be true already, but god damn, i need to hear it from other people, please..."

430,1,I dont have a vehicle to get to meetings or anything. Our towns bus system quits running at 5 and the meetings are at 7 pm. Anyways is their any live support chat or anybody i can lean on for support the next week? I rather not disclose my opiate of choice but im looking at 1 too 2 weeks of withdrawel. Just any support of any sort or other places to go online. I have a bunch of games to keep me busy.
431,1,"I checked myself into treatment last year on March 6th (my birthday), had several 1-2 day relapses during the year but I still consider that great progress considering how heavy of a user I used to be. Then I had surgery in November and took some liberties with my norcos, but still was fairly responsible with them all things considered. Until I ran out at which point I lasted a week before I started buying oxy. And just as always, it starts out as harmless fun and you think this time will be different because hey I‚Äôm able to only take it a couple times a week. And then it‚Äôs every day, and then a couple times a day. Now it‚Äôs been 2-3 months and I can no longer take days off without getting sick - something I swore I would never make myself go through again. I do not want to still be using when March 6th to rolls around again - the last year has been shitty and I‚Äôd like to put it behind me and hopefully have my first happy/good year since I started using 5yrs ago - fuck letting this problem infect even 1 day of my new year. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve tried to kick cold the last 2 weeks or so since I‚Äôm not in that deep yet so the withdrawals should be very tolerable relative to 3 years of heavy fent use withdrawal that I went through last year. But I couldn‚Äôt even do that, I get to 36-48hrs and don‚Äôt feel terrible but then cave in bc I guess I justify that as not needing to quit just yet. Now I‚Äôve got subutex and I‚Äôm planning on doing a 5-7 day taper, starting at as low of a dose as possible. Used my last oxy last night at 8pm so now just waiting until I can take my first sub.

Luckily, and coincidentally, my oxy guy decided he‚Äôs getting out of the game the same day I was getting my last few pills from him. So now I don‚Äôt have a connect."
432,1,"So after court I come to find out not only did my step dad call the cops on me but also my dad and stepmom. So I was talking to my stepmom who has been super supportive asking how she could have sold me out like that.


She said we were afraid that you were gonna smash someone‚Äôs head in with a hammer. So we called the cops. I say well I think it‚Äôs kinda fucked up that my dad of people having been threw this would have called the cops on me. She says well your dad never got high (I wasn‚Äôt high at the time) and tried to kill someone (never tried to do that either. I smashed a windshield w a hammer).


And that pissed my the fuck off. I said oh really. My dad never got drunk and put a gun to my moms head? Never dragged my sister around the yard by her hair? Never beat the shit out of me? She said oh I didn‚Äôt know that happened. 


So let‚Äôs think about that for a minute. I never ever expected my dad to apologize to me (and he never did) but your telling me in 19 years of marriage he never once told his wife he felt like a piece of shit for all the things he did.


What the fuck is that shit!!!! I‚Äôve been on a world apology tour the last 92 days and in 6935 days my dad never thought to apologize to anyone? Never fucking felt bad about shit. Never thought to think what I did was wrong. Never ever told his wife hey I can I talk to you about what I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm so fucking done w him. Holy fuck"
433,1,"My anxiety prevents me from doing mostly anything. I rarely leave the house. It was hard enough to go to a clinic. Its a reason i used in the first place. It leaves me in panic attacks and hysterically crying when i even try to do any interactions. My mind freezes and i sound brain damaged. I cant focus on anything but my heart racing and trying to just breathe. I have 0 friends, only a fiance i am still working towards even telling abiut my problem. (Please dont give me shit about it i know its fucked up and i beat myself up everyday for it). The meetings in my area all have unvolunteered speaking things. Like being handed the basic text and talking about yourself and reading aloud. Other things similar. I have gone with my counselor i am comfortable with but it didnt change anything. I cant focus there.   Sometimes i can talk one on one if the person talks more than i do, thats when i find my brain remembering how to form words and not make me start panicing. I need a support group but im too socially inept to even get one."
435,1,"Today, the goal is to use just enough Heroin to be functional at work. I don't plan to use any past noon and I'm attempting to take just enough to keep withdrawals at bay versus getting high. So that's today's goal. Tomorrow's goal though. Oh, boy. Wish me luck. I plan to use nothing. I'm so freaking scared. I already did this once this month and only got to 11 days or so before I relapsed. 

Some things I'm going to do differently are:

1. dump the remaining dope after work today
2. delete my dealers number 
3. Possibly take Monday off work if I need it.

I think doing those 3 things will help tremendously. What do you think? What should I add to plan? Any help and input for going through this is appreciated. I could probably use some encouragement too. I really want to be OK and off dope. 

Anyway, thanks for listening."
437,1,"
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post. It‚Äôs my first time. 

I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve been in and out of recovery for almost 3 years. This time, I‚Äôve been using for almost 3 months. And withdraw is the worst. I don‚Äôt remember it being this horrible. Even taking subs I can‚Äôt get through it. No insurance so I can‚Äôt go into detox somewhere. The drugs I‚Äôm doing are Baltimore caps of dope, white powder. And I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm going to lose my apartment, car, and my relationship. No matter how many times I swear I‚Äôm not gonna pick up, I do. I can‚Äôt believe I let myself get to this point again. I feel hopeless. I know once I get past the withdraw, I need to go to meetings everyday. And get involved again. I just can‚Äôt figure out how to get over the 5 days of hell. I just need some advice. Or motivation. Anything... like I said I tried subs that I bought off the street. And they literally did nothing to help the sickness. And that scares the shit out of me. What do I do now. I‚Äôve been considering getting on methadone but I don‚Äôt wanna be stuck on that. Any advise or response is greatly appreciated .."

440,1,"My office park had a mobile blood drive today and everyone was really excited about it...except me. As a former IV user, I can no longer donate. I have been tested several times for all blood related illnesses but they still don‚Äôt want my blood and I understand why.

I had to make up a story about some medication preventing me from donating to my coworkers (which they bought) but inside I was really embarrassed."
441,1,"When I‚Äôm sober I feel like I need to catch up on things I‚Äôve missed. Right now I‚Äôm like damn, there‚Äôs so many friends I wanna see, places I wanna go to, games I want to play, old hobbies I want to pursue and music I want to listen to ahh. 

I‚Äôve missed so much of the real world it‚Äôs pretty overwhelming right now. When I was high I just breezed through everything and didn‚Äôt actively pursue anything. I don‚Äôt know if I put this across well but i gave it a shot."
442,1,"I was listening to a recovery podcast last night and he was talking about finding new passions and activities. It helped me realize that while I go to meetings, work, read, listen to music, take walks, baths etc, that activity/passion piece of the pie was missing from my life. 

So I went ice skating today with my dog! It was really nice to get the fresh air, sun, and do an activity I‚Äôve always liked to do. It‚Äôs not much but I‚Äôm proud of myself and wanted to encourage everyone else out there to go outside and explore with this beautiful gift we have called recovery. 

Peace and love to you all."
443,1,"There are two drugs which have been enormously beneficial to me doing my wd that are seldom mentioned. So I wanted to give a shout out to Soma  (Carisoprodol) 350 mg., classified as a muscle relaxer. It will knock you out, so just take one, right before you go to bed. The best part is that it is not physically addictive, although it is a controlled substance.

The other is phenobarbital. It is a long acting barbiturate, and I don't even know what they use it for nowdays. It is potent and will keep you asleep all night long.  It is mildly addictive (but not nearly as bad as something like benzos) and is also a controlled substance - schedule IV.

Another one that I have not heard anything about in years would be Paregoric - also known as tincture of opium. I think it is schedule V and seems like it would be useful during a taper."
444,1,"Today is 2 months clean off dope, which is the longest I‚Äôve had in my entire 4 years of using. Yaaay wohoooo. But fuck me if it ain‚Äôt hard and if it‚Äôs not turning one addiction to another. I have been drinking lately more then I was in the past. Not an alarming amount (yet) but my justification is ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not doing dope‚Äù and it SUCKS ASSSSS. I‚Äôm having a hard time dealing with real life stresses. Dating and work in particular have made my anxiety unbearable and wanting to use something to numb the pain. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know what real point this post has. Life is just fucking bullshit huh."
445,1,"Stopped counting the days, life‚Äôs great. Realized everyone at work knew I was blowing lines of fent in the bathroom for months and now that I‚Äôm not have received various promotions etc. Got a baby french bulldog who‚Äôs keeping me VERY busy outside of work but she‚Äôs the best. Just wanted to post this to let you all know there is still hope for you to change your life you just have to want it.  You can check my old posts where I was consistently relapsing trying and trying. My advice is never fucking give up its worth it.  HMU if you‚Äôre still struggling and need any kind of advice.  This subreddit saved my life."
446,1,"ain‚Äôt shit, but, i can‚Äôt wait for leap day for my 60 SOLID ASS DAYS SOBER OFF ALL OPIATES AND AIDIND DRUGS FOR OPIATE ABUSE!"
447,1,"Ahh panic.. my old familiar friend. 

I just turned 43, I have $70,000 worth of student loans I can‚Äôt pay, a shitty low wage job that was supposed to be a foot in the door (but here I am 3 years later not even making enough to pay mortgage and bills), and my wife was just laid off. 

FUN!

I am struggling to wrap my brain around what I am supposed to do here. I feel like a steak that someone put in their freezer 20 years ago and now it‚Äôs long past it‚Äôs expiry date. Wasn‚Äôt I supposed to die of an overdose by the time I was 23? 

At least when I was loaded I only had one problem: getting heroin. Now it‚Äôs fucking fixed interest mortgage payments, vehicle maintenance, and lying to my kids that if they study and work hard they can get ahead and be happy. 

So, I‚Äôm supposed to say how I‚Äôm so grateful I‚Äôm not loaded today, but fuck am I? Fuck, honestly I wish I was. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to think or feel right now. I wish this dripping sweat under my arms, cold spike of panic in my brain, and overwhelming depression was gone in a wave of euphoric bliss. 

Damn near 20 years off the smack, and a whopping 3 months off the subs, life is teaming up with PAWS to kick my ass all over the map today. I found myself mumbling to myself in front of other people this morning and I worry my mask of sanity is slipping.

I‚Äôm a writer and journalist in a small town where all the news is now owned by right-wing corporations and only hire young fresh-faced students... but I can‚Äôt move to a bigger city as I have split custody of my 13 year-old son. 

I was born into poverty, it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve known. I went back to school to better myself and find a career I could advance in, only to find out that no one wanted to hire a 29 year-old with a criminal record.

Ok. Self pity poison out of the way. What are my options- Talk to my boss and tell him it‚Äôs not working out? Keep looking for another less-shitty paying job? It‚Äôs been years since I was paid to write anything, have I lost it? Should I be grateful and shut the hell up? 

Goddamn I want to get loaded and forget everything... but it‚Äôll just be there tomorrow when I‚Äôm done throwing up. So I guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúput one fucking foot in front of another‚Äù and try to stay positive. 

Thanks for letting me purge.. good luck everyone, have a better day!"
448,1,"Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm currently tapering down off suboxone and take maybe 2mg for the whole day. I do have panic attacks and what not so I‚Äôm panicking about taking klonapin seeing about mixing them together can be deathly. 

I‚Äôm prescribed 0.05 which is a half of klonapin. I usually only take a quarter back in the day when I use to take them to knock the edge off.


I‚Äôm curious if I can mix them. Can I take a quarter of a half mil of klonapin while sub is in my system? 

My doctor is an asshole and hates the world so I never ask questions when I go in! Asking for advice if anyone‚Äôs taken them together!"
449,1,"My situation is pretty unique.  At least I feel like it is.  I've been on subs for over 12 years now.  12mg a day like clockwork for the last 5 years.  I'm pretty sure I'm my doctors longest running patient.  There were a couple things that contributed to my current situation.  Back in 2008 my wife had an affair with a co-worker.  It brought on pain and depression that I didn't know existed.  I had a co-worker at the time that turned me onto pain pills.  Oxy's, roxys, percs. methadone, etc.  I was able to completely turn  it off.  The depression, that is.  My mother who was a struggling addict had just gotten prescribed Suboxone from her doctor.  She called me up and said you should give this stuff a try.  Well, that was 12 years ago and here I am.  I guess you could say I was addicted to subs before I even gave myself a chance to get addicted to the other opiates mentioned above.  I want to put this stuff behind me so bad.  I'm manage an Inn with my wife(we worked it out, and are better than ever) We work very hard, and we've been very successful.  I just have this monkey on my back.  I recently lost my health insurance because of it, and I can't get any life insurance because I'm on suboxone.  So I'm paying nearly $600 a month out of pocket just to keep myself going basically.  I don't even know where to start as far as quitting goes.  I read all the horror stories about coming off and it's terrifying.  I've already struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, so that's the part that scares me the most.  I'd like to get on a controlled taper plan, but my doctor has no desire to help me.  Every time I bring it up, he shuts it down  and says you'll always be an addict.  You don't take a diabetic off of  his insulin, do you?  The thing is, I truly believe I would have no trouble staying off pain pills if I could just get through the withdrawals.  I'm not the same person I was 12 years ago.  I have 2 beautiful kids, and a wonderful marriage.  I just feel like if I try to come off this stuff, I will have a nervous breakdown, and all I want to do in life is be the man my family needs me to be.  Has anyone else been able to taper successfully after being on it for such a long time?  I feel like I would have a much easier time getting off this stuff if I had a supportive doctor.   Please share your thoughts if you have any."
450,1,I am looking to get other peoples perferences. If you plan on quitting is it better to take your last shot at night before bed or to take one in the morning
451,1,Seeing Theo (Von) tonight. Saw him back in october and he was hilarious. Very excited to see him again! What does everyone have going on?
452,1,"halfway between i think week 9 &amp; 10 off the meds...daily suboxone user for i think almost 15 yrs. and now i generally feel alright most days, mornings can be tough. cold light of day and all. i have resigned to living with a faucet for a nose. will that ever go away?"
453,1,"That‚Äôs a Cadillac problem compared to last week.
Where all I was concerned was how to get high
And hide
Well now you‚Äôve been found in plain sight
You‚Äôve bought the ticket, so you take the ride
Two weeks ago I‚Äôd have passed out by 11
But I haven‚Äôt slept in two days now and it‚Äôs 2:57

Some they love it but I fucking hate you
I lived the past five years of my life to placate you
But there was no such thing as enough
My best friend OD‚Äôd but I just shot 5 fucking bags of the stuff

Wow

But I think I figured it out
That is a life I‚Äôm no longer about
I flushed the last of my shit and snapped my last two syringes in half
Because I‚Äôm done with shit and I‚Äôm not looking back

I may be crying in bed, feeling embarrassed and weak,
But those are Cadillac problems compared to last week.

2/15/2020. The day I almost died for my sobriety. Haven‚Äôt had a single craving since."
454,1,"Think about the first time you tried opiates. It was probably the most innocent thing. Maybe you had a surgery and wanted to see how it felt or just liked how it felt. You get that warm and fuzzy feeling like nothing could be better. 

Next thing you know you're asking a friend who sells you a couple. You take them on and off because it feels good. You probably forgot about your childhood trauma or the anxiety and depression you used to have. All you know is that this pill is making everything so much better. You start spending more money and getting them more often.

Now people might be warning you that you're going down a bad path. You don't believe them because you have it all under control. People start saying things, like ""this shit doesn't discriminate, be careful"". Oh but you have it all under control, addiction could never happen to me. I have a good life, good job, the perfect fiance, nah that would never happen.

Fast forward maybe a year, now you're taking triple of what you started with. It was on and off but you accidentally went on a binge. Maybe things have been tough at work or in your personal life. So this binge lasts maybe 4 days. You get minor withdrawals but it's no big deal right? Now you know that you can go this many days without feeling terrible. So then you push it a little further and instead of 4 days now it's a week and a half maybe two.

At this point, you feel like absolute dog shit. You go back to the plug and get some Suboxone or subutex. You start taking it for the withdrawals. Soon you find yourself dependent on the subs. You're taking them every day and at a pretty high dose because you still want to feel relaxed.

Days turn to weeks, weeks turns to months, and before you know it you've been taking Suboxone for a year. Of course inbetween you're dabbling with the oxy or opiate of choice.

A year on Suboxone now and all those childhood traumas, the anxiety, the depression, it's all coming to light. You've lost motivation in anything and everything. You don't enjoy the things you used to. You're sitting back watching life pass you by thinking you have no purpose in life.

One day, you get sick of feeling like you're wasting your life. So you decide to stop taking Suboxone, however, you have no idea what you're doing or how to do it. You just know that you need to stop so you quit cold turkey.

Each day that goes by you feel worse and worse. You keep telling yourself that tomorrow will be better. Eventually you've gone a few weeks and tomorrow hasn't came. You've tried anything and everything to help with withdrawals.

That's when it really hits you... Why did I do this to myself. Why did I let myself get to this point. HOW did I get to this point?! This could NEVER happen to me!! 

But yet you're sitting there sick... Your new truck has been reposessed...You're a month behind on your mortgage.. and all you can do is sit there praying you feel better tomorrow... When will tomorrow come?

Please, if anyone is on here reading this, please, I'm literally begging you to think twice before you dive into this terrible world of opiates. It's not worth all that is to follow. Go smoke weed or something if you want to get high and relax. This path of opiates is one of disaster and heartache. You will lose personal belongings, money, your friends, your family, and most of all yourself. It's not worth it. I'm sure you'll do what you want, as did I, but please just consider the consequences."
456,1,"Hello this is my first post. I‚Äôm now 24 hours off pressed ms and blue pharma 30s. I went into the sub clinic today and pissed clean due to the pressed pills and was given a script to subs 8mg. I still can‚Äôt sleep at all on the subs. Is this normal ? I feel perfectly fine, unlike before I went into the clinic. I waited 17 hours before my 1st sub dose and had no pwd from the pressed pills. What am I looking at in the coming days ?"
457,1,"So I'm on the 14th day. Really the major things I have been experiencing is I can't sleep and my stomach is upset. Last night I took 50mg trazadone. I fell asleep and woke up within the hour feeling restless. I took another 50mg and slept for quite a while however I felt like shit after I was so groggy the entire day and I didn't like it.

I have gotten my hands on 800mg gabapentin and .5mg klonopin. I only plan on taking half of the gabapentin. Will gabapentin and klonopin react?

Is it safe to take 400mg gabapentin and .5mg klonopin?

I currently take 150mg zoloft and 40mg Buspar daily along with 30mg adderall."
458,1,Yeah few years back I had a Drug counselor working on her CADC requirements ( not licensed yet) it was at MAT program here in Detroit. Anyway long story short we got close we became friends and then more than friends. It was a crazy time for the both of us I know it was for me the client with chronic relapsing and polysubstance abuse and severe mental health issues untreated all of which plus more were discussed in sessions. Fast forward a year we had great time as friends great times as lovers and great times in general. I liked her. I was a sick person cheating on my long term GF with multiple girls most of them just because of boredum. And bad habits. But this Girl was different My current GF was in rehab getting her life together and before that wasnt in the best place her self. So I had time to spend with my counselor/friend at this point/yeah And I did alot I grew really close to her and ended kinda falling for her I think or I thought. Now it's been a year and me and my long term girlfriend are working things out happily and maybe not as healthily as we should but we are trying well she's trying I'm lying I don't know I'm so confused I don't know what im asking. Maybe if anyone has ever had a relationship with a drug counselor? How did it work? There is alot of shit I'm leaving out because in Detroit there is a few clinics and Yeah. Im having some issues with this and it's coming out in different ways.(asking for help) (trust) (guilt) maybe someone's got experience and we can chat. Let me know asap. Thanks in advance and sorry for the horrible spelling editing and grammar. I'm 41 and not well versed on messing with a keyboard.
459,1,"I have cptsd, i recently discovered was a thing. I realized it when i kept getting triggered by a family members addiction/relapses. I would try all the coping tools i learned from my first trauma but nothing helped. It was like starting from the beginning of my paranoid/panic self but worse. These past 2 months I've been doing my best to understand it because he's really recovering and i want to feel as supportive and excited and PRESENT instead of avoiding him. I think i know the core reason, and i need a recovered addicts perspective/opinion. I dont want to trigger anybody either so if you're not ready to talk i understand. Ill give more details if you reply."
460,1,"Has anyone found a need to change their career once getting sober or to maintain sobriety?

I worked in sales for many years, but during addiction and getting sober I was really only able to do more trade work. I liked working with my hands, but overall I prefer the conditions of an office and mental challenge vs physical challenge. I felt like I had the capacity to do more than physical labor (not trying to make this a white vs blue collar argument).

I got a job back in the same line of sales last year and it started off good. However, over the past couple months I‚Äôve been having second thoughts. Some of it is the product/service I‚Äôm selling, but more so it is the huge amount of clients/leads/tasks to keep track of and the stress. I liked punching in and out of my old job and work didn‚Äôt go beyond that. At my current job, I feel like it‚Äôs always on my mind and worries me I‚Äôm falling behind.

Has anyone had a similar situation? I thought about trying to take some of my sales skill set and translate that to something like a project manager, where I don‚Äôt have to feel like I‚Äôm in hustle mode 100% of the time."
461,1,"1 month 3 days sober from brown. My perspective is fluid, consistently changing. Functioning addict &amp; feelgood weekends, where does the line get drawn? Who decides that? 

p.s. anyone new to recovery, it gets easier. üíï Now that I'm not dependent on such a dirty drug my mind is curious how drugs in moderation (lsd) can better my perspective &amp; maybe self reflection."
462,1,"This is a quick read that I found to be highly relatable. Wanted to share. Keep on keepin on, friends.

463,1,"was clean for 3 years until a month ago I relapsed on these pressed fent 30's. About 10 days ago I tried to kick with subs but I guess 24 hours wasn't long enough I went into PWDs. So I switched to BTH for the last 10 days and just did the last of it. I have 4 days off work some subs and only 8 bars. My plan is take a bar tomorrow morning and a 4mg sub and another bar tomorrow night. Then friday take 2 mg sub and bar morning and 1 bar both morning and night. Then Saturday 1mg sub 1 bar both morning and night. Then  Sunday 1/2 mg sub 1 bar both morning and night. Then back to work Monday with nothing. Does this plan sound good? Is it enough time for the sub with PWDs ?
Willing to listen to any advise. It's just been 3 years since I went through all this and this fent shit changed the game"
464,1,"I have been an opiate abuser/addict since 2012. Started off slow. Tramadol, then vikes, then oxy's, then heroin/fent. When I was caught nodding out at work by my sister a few years back, my family helped me get into a detox facility and I completed 28 days inpatient rehab on suboxone and remained on subs for a year. About 8 months ago I relapsed and for whatever reason I decided to try out methadone. Started at the usual 30 mg and worked my way up to 160 mg. I have been working third shift and the doses were wearing off. 

Friday will be my last dose of methadone. I can't move forward in life paying $400/mo for methadone anymore. The only other time I have really been through a bad w/d was the first time I went to detox. My doctor advised me to taper off but it just isn't an option. I would rather go through a few weeks of hell than a year of tapering. My mother is going to be coming to stay with me at my place for at least the first week or two and I have work off as long as I need. I picked up a hundred xanax that she will be keeping in a lock box to help ease some of the pain. I've also got trazadone for insomnia and the usual chlonidine and gabapentin.

What are some things I can do to better prepare myself? My brain has been bombarded by opiates or some form of maintenance medication for so long, I can only imagine how rough this will be. What I dread the most are restless legs. Any and all advice is welcome. This is a great subreddit community and I have learned a lot reading others stories. Thanks in advance."

469,1,"I‚Äôm recently coming off a Kratom and Phenibut addiction as well as Heroin. It‚Äôs been almost a year since I‚Äôve taken Heroin, 11 days since I‚Äôve taken Kratom and 3 days since I‚Äôve taken Phenibut. All this drug use is all ready causing tension on my marriage. We are also struggling with our sex life. Im currently taking 50mg of Nal a day. Has anyone else struggled in these areas?"
470,1,"Today marks 20 days since I last touched H. I wrote my thoughts on the first ten days. Since then days 11-15 still had lingering restlessness/rls (which although minor, still sucks bad) then the last 4 nights I have been able to lay in bed all night without tossing/turning/kicking (what a great feeling) - still wake up every couple hours / broken sleep. Now I‚Äôm wrestling with ambition to do things, and my legs feel like they have 25lb weights attached to them. I‚Äôve been going to the gym the last 7 days but usually I could easily run 5-6 miles at a time and now it‚Äôs a one mile jog. Why does your body get SO tired/fatigued for SO long??? - and a tiny little bit of powder will get u back to runnin 6 miles again... weird how the brain works.."
471,1,Got an infection in my mouth and had to have a root canal and I got prescribed promethXcodeine. I am a recovering Oxy/heroin user. Do I throw away the bottle? Will it bring back withdrawals? Or am I fine?
473,1,"I‚Äôve been taking 60mg of hydrocodone a day for my chronic pain for about 7 months. Last month my doctor also prescribed me gabapentin 1800mg through out the day and .5 mg of Xanax before bedtime. 

I am looking to quit everything and see how I can deal with the pain. How bad are withdrawals going to be since I added gabapentin and Xanax over the month?  Am I fucked?"
474,1,"My friend was diagnosed as schizophrenic at age 14. She is 28 and recently (less than 1 year) had a very traumatic experience with her ex. He physically beat her and treated her like shit. He told her to kill herself and she did, only for him to bring her back and to berate her some more. She loved him for some reason, and he kept using her for every possible material thing he could. She now has no money, no car, no license, etc.

She has since left him, but has not been doing so well on her own. She picked up escorting to make money and started smoking heroin (former needle user) and crack. She says she'll stop after she hits a monetary goal but most of her time is spent sleeping, eating, and getting high. The little money she made so far goes towards the hotel cost and her goal is quite large (not unrealistic for an escort, but she doesn't have her shit together). She's gotten visibly fatter in the few months that she's been escorting. She's becoming cold towards me and I worry she's going to inevitably overdose. I offered to pay for suboxone treatment and even bought kratom for her, but she said she needs to numb herself to deal with her clients.

I've listened to Dr Drew say that traumatic events feed people's addictions. And that until the addiction is dealt with, the trauma can not even start to be dealt with. I also know that you can't force an addict  into recovery.

I care about her a lot and it's taking an enormous emotional toll on me knowing her future is bleak. Do I try to continue to help her or do I try to save myself from the pain and distance myself hoping she'll bounce back? Should I offer to get her a cheap car (used) if she gets clean at my place? My fear is that she'll just get clean and go back to heroin once she gets the reward."

476,1,Well I‚Äôm on day three and I will be honest I‚Äôve still used buuuuut the cravings have gotten less and less and I‚Äôve gone from using 20 pressed m30 blues a day to just six today. I‚Äôm on 40mg of methadone so tomorrow I‚Äôm going to try to not do any blues at all! Wish me luck guys. I‚Äôm not trying to go over 40mg of methadone if I don‚Äôt have to.
477,1,"I‚Äôm over 11 months clean and not really thinking about doing opiates, but I just need to get somethings out to people and ask for support. Me and my wife started a farm in the middle of fucking no where. During the planning stage we ran into a lot of different road blocks. At first me and my friend were going to start and run the farm, but we didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay him so I was stuck knowing I couldn‚Äôt turn land into farm by myself.  

Enter my now wife who decided that we should move up our wedding we were planning, get eloped, and start the farm together. I thought this was a great idea but I had some reservations. I come from a labor background and know how brutal some work is. I stressed to her that this was a concern of mine... like beyond stressed... we even had a conversation with our therapist about it. She convinced me that she was into it and that we should start the process. So we eloped and started building this farm.

The building process was brutal. Lots of land clearing and trying to operate a tractor being a total rookie. But we did it! We got our cover crop down before winter and moved into our house at the start of the new year. I was so fucking happy. Like tears of joy happy on multiple occasions. Our hard work was taking shape. 

When we moved into our house something changed in my wife. She would constantly complain about everything. Somethings were warranted but a lot of it was just maniacal complaining . The weather has been shit since we moved in. It‚Äôs rained more days than it hasn‚Äôt and our house sits on like 3 acres of mud as we await our grass to come up. We have a large dog who likes to go outside so the house ends up muddy and dirty. She‚Äôs developed this ocd like obsession with cleaning. Looking back on it, it was a sign that I didn‚Äôt pick up on.

Did I mention how far out in the middle of nowhere we are? We have 300 acres of wooded land and we don‚Äôt have any neighbors. We are 2.5 hours away from friends and family that we‚Äôve left, but we knew all of this going in. We‚Äôve actually had quite a few guests who have came through in our short time here. We are isolated but not stranded or anything. Our life is way different here than from the one we left behind. We cook all our meals and spend the whole day with each other. I made a resolution to stop frequently drinking but my wife claims she needs it and continued to have a couple glasses of wine a night. Another sign I didn‚Äôt pick up on but I come from a family of drinkers and just thought it‚Äôs normal behavior. 

Sex has been weird since coming off my habit. I‚Äôm so sensitive still after 11 months and can tell I‚Äôm disappointing her. The first time I detoxed I had sensitivity issues but they went away within a month. I don‚Äôt get it and it‚Äôs really embarrassing so I‚Äôm rarely in the mood. A few weeks ago she complained about our sex life and I tried to be better. This past week she has turned me down because she‚Äôs not in the mood on separate occasions. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs repulsed by me. 

Sunday she told me she was unhappy for all the reasons listed above. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am crushed. She convinced me that we can do this and now she wants to leave 2 months in. I feel so used. When she first told me I was hit with all the bad emotions all at once. It was like a tidal wave hit me. I know I can‚Äôt change her mind about this, but Jesus fucking Christ what am I going to do? I‚Äôm so stuck with way more money in this than I could‚Äôve ever imagined.

478,1,"I am waiting on a call for my suboxone. I saw the people last Friday and I am honestly going to call tomorrow because I cannot wait anymore. I ran out on Sunday and thought I would get the subs Monday or something.

My wife came to visit me and I was in the middle of so-so withdrawal and once I went to meet her and walk home my withdrawal have been better. Is she just occupying my mind whereas I would usually just focus on how shit I am feeling?

Also, how long did it take any of you to get Suboxone? I was told it would happen fast because the goal is to get me off ASAP. It will be Wednesday tomorrow and I am starting to freak out. I am thinking of calling tomorrow to ask what's up."
479,1,Today is day three on the methadone program and I will say day 1 and 2 I still used because at 30 mg it didn‚Äôt do anything for me. Today is day 3 and although I did use the cravings have dropped so much and I used out of habit. I‚Äôve made it the whole day so far on only 4 pressed blues when usually I‚Äôd be 10 deep already. I did go up to 40 mg today and it seemed to help a lot.
480,1,"So I was clean 3 years until I ran into an old high school friend... long story short I got strung out on fentanyl pressed 30's. Tried quitting with subs after waiting 24 hours but went into PWDs. So last week I tried switching to my old friend BTH and now planning on quitting I have a bunch of subs and only 8 xany bars. Plan is to use last BTH Tonight and start subs tomorrow night. I have 6 days of work. My game plan is to try 4mg tomorrow night with a bar and slowly taper down 1 mg of sub and 2 bars daily until down to nothing. Please help with any suggestions. All feedback is welcome just want to get back on the sober team. 

P.S. live with wife and kids and would like them not to find out until after I am already back sober and ready to tell them."
481,1,"Welp, I relapsed at around day 150. I was ashamed to admit it, but I think it‚Äôs probably important not to beat yourself up too hard about it and just continue on the right path. 

I say relapsed because obviously I had a shit day and fell back into my old habits and that‚Äôs lame of me. I did 60mg of oxy. But honestly, I think it helped me overall. I feel a lot less need to go back to it now. I don‚Äôt get the same feeling I used to. 

After I did them, I felt TOO fucked up. I never had a ceiling for fucked-up-ness before. I felt sick to my stomach and threw up in between nodding out. The only thing I liked about it is that I fell dead asleep for like 12 hours, but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt stop falling asleep throughout the day. I remembered that this is how I felt the first time I ever did them and how I wasn‚Äôt that big of a fan until I made a habit of it. It‚Äôs just not fun anymore. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been back in the wagon since. At least I got that out of my system. Btw, this post is NOT an encouragement for any of y‚Äôall to give in to the want to relapse. I‚Äôm just lucky I didn‚Äôt feel the same about it, otherwise I‚Äôd be right back into my old shitty life, no doubt. But if you do happen to slip up, take it with a grain of salt and keep doing better for yourself."

The mission of this app is to help make recovery accessible to all addicts regardless of barriers like accessibility, insurance coverage, fear of breaching anonymity, lack of childcare, financial barriers, etc. It will always be completely FREE for addicts.

One key function of the app is the crisis call button which allows users to get in touch with a fellow addict anywhere at any any time. ADAP will offer an anonymous social network, the ability to plan/share events, meeting finders, sobriety tracker, and chat abilities. ADAP is not affiliated with any anonymous fellowship and is open to users with various addictions.

485,1,"5 whole months!! I can hardly believe it. Fentanyl controlled my life for years and I finally am making significant progress towards recovering from that. I tried so many times before but could barely make it to a month before I relapsed. Something just felt....different this time, you know?

486,1,"Coming off of pressed blues. About 90 mg daily. Anyways, I've been using kratom to help with quitting, and I am now 7 days off the hard stuff. Well!!!!! I just said no to percocet! Yay! I just wanted to share this tiny little yet significant success! Btw, I've read and read every post, and this thread along with opiate withdrawal is what gave me the courage to attempt recovery. I've been using since 13 and I am a 31 year old woman now.  Time to let it go! 

Thank you to everyone who shares here. You are making a difference to others whether you know it or not! Next week, I'll attempt to come off the kratom. Just a slave searching for freedom!"
487,1,"I haven't found an answer to this question after googling for days. Weird if it hasn't been asked. Any info or links to other threads would be greatly appreciated.

Is it possible to suffer from PAWS when you switch from a full agonist (in my case, morphine) to a partial agonist (in my case, buprenorphine aka Suboxone)? Or is it considered to be a problem that you only face after quitting all opiates completely?

I switched from morphine (poppy pod tea and PST) to Suboxone about 6 months ago. Tried to get stable on 2mg once a day for a long time, but often took a second, smaller dose in the evening, totaling anywhere from 3mg to 8mg per day. In the last week or so I've been noticing a significant boost in my energy levels and the overall fatigue and depression just disappearing. And I don't even need the whole 2mg anymore, I can do a full day on 1-1,5mg. I just feel so normal. 

Any ideas on what's happening here? Did I just magically stabilize or something, even though my doses have been fluctuating between 2mg to 8mg per day? I haven't had any changes in my semi-healthy lifestyle. Not that I don't like this, I'm just afraid that it's not permanent."
488,1,What 3 habits will improve your life?
489,1,"Hello everyone, 1st time poster.  I was on pain meds for 5 years(90 10mg oxy, 15 25mcg fent patches), and 2 years ago decided no more. Got clean using subs for 3 days then cold Turkey the rest of the way.  It took 78 days to feel normal, and almost 7 months to be me again.  Fast forward another year, and i found the remaining subs i had for the first 3 days,  and took 1mg, and felt amazing(of course), and continued using 1mg until 2 days ago(about a year total).  How bad will the wds be, seeing as how i was never on a large dose, and really not that long compared to others?  Should i just taper down to a half for a month, then a 1/4mg, and then jump?  If so, how bad do yo think it'll be?"
490,1,"So this is my first post on reddit. I figured it should be about what I am going through so it can maybe help someone else. I (19M) have done weed, acid, shrooms, molly, ecstasy, coke, dmt, lean, and more. I used weed and tobacco daily, trying to quit once in a while, since I was about 13-14. Last year I tried percocet for the first time. My friend gave me 1 30 and told me to snort a quarter. It was strong the first time and it didnt seem that great to me. Fast foward a couple months and I'm living with my friends instead of my old coworkers. I had a physically demanding job and it became a daily thing for me eventually after using it for pain. I dont feel the need to explain how it went from managing pain, to getting high, to just feeling normal. This continued for about a year, where I would quit for a week at most and then go back to it. 

On New Years I almost tried to end my life by ODing but I called someone and they came to make sure I didnt. I progressed to smoking them and a whole one at my worst. After trying to actually quit I realized how addicted I was, even getting time off work wasn't enough. I always just relapsed once I felt normal wo it.

 I've quit my job wo burning bridges, I'm getting unemployment, I got insurance for my prescription and bills. I'm so thankful for my mom bc she helped me try before and is helping me with all this now. My dad only ever called me  a junkie before he left to serbia and left me to quit on my own. I'm currently on suboxone and it's going good. I have less cravings and definitely dont have withdrawls. I lowered my dose from 2 pills to 1 and a half today because I want to make some progress. I have a meeting that's part of the after care clinic at my hospital in two days. 

These were not prescribed percocet, so they had fentanyl in them forsure. I want to be clean now and start getting my life together. I've separated myself from friends I know doing it and doing whatever I can do to make sure I stay away from percs. I created this to  reflect on and for anyone that has a similar problem, and for those who dont have this problem. Dont get it, it is hell."
492,1,"Had an incident a couple weeks ago where I got attacked by a guy with an axe, got my throat and face slashed and also seven teeth knocked out. Was currently on 1mg bupe per 24h, but got a whole lot of morphine IV and fentanyl before/during the main operation on my throat. Now its two weeks later and I have managed to suck it up and deal with the pain without relapsing. Down to 0,4-0,6mg bupe now and plan on going down to 0,25-0,3 tomorrow. Anyone else ever found it easier to quit after traumatic experiences including a lot of pain? I kind of feel more motivated to see this through 100% this time, more motivated than last time even. And that time I managed to quit, only to go back a few months later due to people, places and things.. 

Keep up the fight my brothers and sisters, in this wheel of life we only get so many chances to get it right. Bless you all and hope you make it through."

498,1,"Hey everyone! I have a question I‚Äôm hoping some of you may be able to shed some light on through personal experience..

I‚Äôm prescribed Adderall &amp; Klonopin, been on Adderall for 8 years &amp; Klonopin or Xanax for 12-13 years. I never had an issue with abuse for either medication, and am on a low enough dose of Klonopin that, despite the prolonged usage, I‚Äôve never experienced dangerous WD symptoms from them. 

My question is this: has anyone had their medications taken away after entering detox and/or rehab for opiates? Just looking for some insight into what to expect - should I expect to lose my meds since I‚Äôll be entering a detox? Any advice/personal anecdotes are welcome! Thanks &amp; hope everyone is having a wonderful day!"
499,1,"One of the things that isn't very commonly talked about in in early recover is that once you become sober, if you don't have a strong plan in place everything you've worked towards can fall apart and you can start falling back into old bad habits and routines. For me what that meant was that I would become depressed again and it wouldn't go away until I figured out a way to fix it. 

I went to therapy, I talked to my mom about everything that was going on, and actively tried to get a new job after losing one that I loved. I bounced from job to job, and started becoming more and more depressed with where I was at in life and my lack of accomplishments since leaving rehab. 

What I came to realize is that you can be sober from opiates for 8 years but still be incredibly depressed if you don't change your thought process and bad habits. Eventually depression is all I know, and I'm not even sure what happiness for me means anymore. I don't know who I am, what I enjoy doing while sober, so I start to fall back into addict behavior (without using). I'd catch myself lying about the dumbest shit. 

I've worked on a lot of that stuff the last year, and am finally starting to see the light at the end of the very dark tunnel. I attribute a lot of my depression with my lack of motivation, lack of hobbies, and lack of friends to support me being sober. So I made a change. I started going to meetings more frequently, and tried my best to get out of that dry drunk mentality. I stopped playing the victim in every situation and started to figure out why I was feeling so cynical. 

When you're stuck somewhere in life you don't want to be, and it feels like there's no end in sight, just know that eventually if you put your mind to it you can accomplish just about anything, and you don't have to be a slave to your own mind anymore. I know it's a tough journey, just know that its up to you to make it better. You got this, try to have some faith and things will start turning around for you, even if you feel like you have nothing left. I'm here for anyone who needs to talk, I've been through it all so I get it. Thanks for reading."

When I compare how I was to how I am now, during my active use I was on an endless quest towards escaping reality. I was running away from myself. Now what I'm doing is running towards myself. I'm building myself to be a better person, a better daughter, and a better mother.

I am currently working towards attaining a master's degree in social work (MSW) so I can ultimately work with people that were and are just like us. I want to share my story and strength to help those that are struggling to transcend their addiction.

I need your help! In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master's of Social Work (MSW), I am conducting a research study that involves a survey that I have designed about the attitudes and beliefs about addiction among those in recovery and/or active addiction. I need approximately 50 people that, again, are either in recovery or still using. So far I only have 2 :( My original plan to distribute these surveys in person to members of local AA groups fell through because of the disruption and chaos caused by the current world crisis. The survey is brief and quick, and **100% completely confidential**. I'm including the link below. Your participation is greatly appreciated. Thank you for all your help!

3,1,"I was once convinced that if I could only find the right combination of circumstances, that I would be able to drink without problems. 

I told myself that if I only went to the bar close to my house, then I wouldn't be driving all over town drunk, but I'd always end up rambling around. 

I told myself that if I only brought $20 with me to the bar, I'd have to go home after that, but I'd end up mooching off of the poor schmucks sitting around me.

I told myself that if I only stayed out until 11pm, that I'd be okay to work the next day, but I'd end up at some after bar party and showing up to work still half-drunk.

I never even attempted to control the pot.

It turned out that the only drink that I have ANY control over is the first one. Good intentions and plans and promises all go right in the gutter as soon as that alcohol hits my blood stream. One day I got a nudge from a judge, that had me go get an AODA assessment. Turns out I'm an alcoholic/addict! Honestly, if it hadn't been for that, I don't know if I'd have quit. With my family all using alcohol to cope, and my friends all being users as well, I didn't even know that there was another way! So I stopped trying to fight it, and I (eventually) came to my senses. I did intensive outpatient treatment. I stopped going to bars altogether. I started going to meetings. I made friends with other people who were clean and sober. It was really hard, at first, actually. But the more I learned about myself, the longer I stayed clean and sober, the easier it got. 

The takeaway messages that I have for you, if you're struggling, are to (a) avoid eye-contact with neon; nothing good happens where there are neon signs! and (b) go to sober meetings and events! (Online, for the moment, probably.) Make friends who have the lifestyle that you want! Ask for help from people who inspire you! And (c) don't let God get in your way. If you're a spiritual/religious person, great. No problem for you! But if you're like me, and the word Jesus leaves a nasty taste in your mouth, then suck it up. Not everybody in the programs is godly. Use ""Good Orderly Direction"" as a placeholder/acronym for god. You don't have to participate in the prayers. If you're not comfortable with a certain meeting, try another one. You can work around the god shit. They tell you to ""take what you need, and leave the rest."" If you live in a more populous area, you might could find a SMART recovery meeting. No god there! I hate all those regurgitated platitudes, too, but the programs actually do work if you work them. 

Stay safe, Friends!"

Of your best friends and family, who supports your recovery and overall health? These are the relationships you need to cultivate. These relationships may have been damaged in the past by things you did while you were using. One way to rebuild trust is to accept your supportive friends and family exactly as they are, rather than trying to change or control them. Focus on the positive traits they bring to the relationship.

Try to think about the other person's needs, while staying aware of your own. Ask what you can do to be a better friend and follow through on what they ask for. Ask your Higher Power to help you build relationships and grow in them.

The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine -- his office is setup with [Change.org](https://change.org/). If we get to 100 signatures, it at minimum makes it's way to his desk. The more signatures obviously, the better.

It takes nothing but 30 seconds from you, to sign this, if you can. It would be, and many of us, very happy to see at least a bit of progress here.

Thank you!

27,1,"Recently I had to have a major surgery. They found cancer on my pancreas. They went in and removed about 1/3 of it and my spleen. It was fucking brutal. From pre-op, right when the anesthesiologists blew my little mind, to 13 days later I was on painkillers. Not just ‚Äúsome‚Äù painkillers either. I know the game and they were pushing a lot through me. It was never once about getting high, always about trying to get back to even with the pain to make another 24 hours of healing. 

I finally went off of them and it was hell. I had been there before, in April of 2009 and it was a grind to make it through then. It only took me about 72 hours of detox but I hated every second of it. It was humbling to realize that I had to detox from drugs after 10 years. Thank god I have an excellent support system. My SO is in recovery and was in charge of the pills the entire time. When she found me in the shower, crying, during the detox she just held me and brought me more blankets when I needed them. 

I say all of that to say this: I still count my time as continuous but once an addict/alcoholic, always an addict/alcoholic. If you are kicking right now, it does get easier and recovery does work."
28,1,"I'm \~32 days clean off of 12mg suboxone, lexapro, and about a 6 week long extremely reckless IV coke/heroin/meth binge. I basically burned my life to the ground in that time, and ended up in the middle of the country at a solitary rehab type place. It's basically a therapeutic, isolated setting for people to work on trauma/other issues, but 90% of people who come here have not or were never addicted to drugs. So it feels kinda like I'm not in the right place to deal with my addiction, but that's a whole other story. But the therapist here seems to not really understand why I am craving drugs, and thought my withdrawal was only supposed to last 5 days as she had read on the internet (WTF?!). I still feel like I'm detoxing.

Anyways, I'm fucking depressed and my cravings are getting out of control to the point where I have been considering leaving just to get some relief. But I will regret it if I do, and possibly die, and definitely be homeless. But it feels like I can't hold out forever these cravings are too strong. They are breaking me and I'm giving up on the hope that I will ever feel okay without drugs. It feels like I am completely unable to feel pleasure, or optimistic about anything. It also feels like maybe this isn't normal, because I've seen many people around me get clean and sober without looking so miserable and stressed out. But I guess that could just be my distorted perception. What do i do?!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any advice/tips/help, 

Much love"
29,1,"I live in a sober living environment for students in recovery. These kids pay like 2400 a MONTH to live here (I am on scholarship so I don't pay nearly as much). It's located in a nice apartment complex off campus (normal rent is like 1000-1200 or something) and has amenities like a pool sauna and gym. Very bougie. They also provide snacks and dinners sometimes.

Anyways, they're supposed to drug test us weekly (like breathalyzer, saliva or urine) and one guy who had relapsed before and has very bad anxiety and bipolar (literally paces for hours and cannot stop) got the boot because he smoked weed. After his last relapse, he asked them to drug test him more often to hold him more accountable. They hadn't done it in 3 weeks and surprise, he started smoking weed. 

I totally think it's ultimately his fault but what the fuck kind of sober living (especially one that is this expensive??) doesn't test their residents for weeks? The agreement is that it is weekly. And before he relapsed the first time he even said they weren't consistent with it. It has dampened my view of the organization and it seems like a scam, especially for the cost and the lack of organization. Plus during this pandemic, I feel like they should have been more stringent given how difficult it is to stay sober in the midst of all the uncertainty and lack of in person meetings.

I feel like a lot of rehabs are just an overpriced sham."
30,1,"Check out my short film, *Mount Skylight,* which is about a group of recovering addicts who discover that everyone in their town has disappeared. They have to figure out what to do, and how to survive.

What began as a short, we are now developing into a feature. We will be getting more in depth with our characters' battles with addiction, and I welcome your input for how we can better tell their stories. Enjoy!

31,1,"I quit alcohol, binge eating &amp; smoking and can‚Äôt help but feel empty. I used to look forward to coming home at night, drink with my friends &amp; get takeout but now that i quit all of it my nights are empty and boring and i can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything about it besides drowning in my own misery.

In the morning, I will have to come clean to my sponsor and to him about what I did. I‚Äôm ashamed and embarrassed. I‚Äôm ashamed at how easy it was to pretend nothing was wrong. My relationship is built on transparency and trust. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose that transparency in my relationship, so I have no choice. I‚Äôm grateful I have trust with my sponsor as well and can tell her everything. 

Thanks for listening."
33,1,"So I‚Äôm 8 months clean, and was living in a halfway house since August. I was planning on getting an apartment in May, but the house got shut down because of the pandemic and I have to live with my mom until I get the apartment. I used a lot when I lived here, so it was a bit of a trigger. I‚Äôve been calling people every day, reading the literature, attending meetings (now virtual), working the steps, etc.

I was looking for food in the fridge, and noticed a bottle of sherry cooking wine, and the impulse set in immediately. I took several swigs, but as soon as I began to feel the ‚Äúwarming effect‚Äù, I immediately felt awful and dumped the rest down the drain. I feel absolutely terrible about doing it, and there‚Äôs so much guilt and shame involved. I never want to experience this ever again.

But if I admit it to everyone in the fellowship that I know, then they‚Äôll consider it a relapse and I‚Äôll have to start my clean time over again.

If I have to start over then I‚Äôll feel completely hopeless about this whole process.

Can this just count as a minor slip and serve as a learning experience? I seriously never want to go through this ever again, I have too much to lose and this feels awful.

What do I do?"
34,1,"In these trying times, remember that the cure is connection. You have to stay away from isolation just like you stay away from a drink and a drug as it is as dangerous.

Have a good 24 everyone."
35,1,"So, for a bit of context. I would say that my addiction is two pronged; I'm a binger (anything I could get my hands on but primarily benzos, ketamine, opiates or alcohol) but I also smoked cannabis daily for years and that was absolutely a dependency type situation. Emotionally I was very dependent on cannabis, as in I couldn't feel anything without it and if I missed my morning smoke then I was on the edge of my nerves and couldn't think clearly. 

Well 18 months ago I quit everything. I came to the realisation that I couldn't carry on like that, my health was being affected, my mental health was a mess (depression and paranoia) and I just wanted to live a normal life. I had the hardest time quitting alcohol and cannabis because I'd become so emotionally dependant on especially cannabis to be able to function on a day to day basis. My life has improved so much since I quit and I was finally starting to feel half normal and to find some sort of meaning to my life. 

Anyway, on Monday I decided I was going to get a bag of bud. I don't know why I did it, I just got the urge to do it and didn't even attempt to fight it. So since Monday I've been smoking all day every day and it feels like I was never gone. Like these last 18 months didn't even happen. And now I'm scared I'm just going to end up exactly where I was and I don't know if I can go through that again."
36,1,"So I'm 60 days sober today and im still working due to having a key job. I get home and the mrs has found a bottle of whisky from christ.as and decided to put it out on the window seal...

We then go out for a walk and someone passed us on a bike but moved out of our way but apparently was to close to me and my son so she tells me in front of our son that I'm a cunt and she wants to hit me and hes probably got corona virus now and it's all my fault because of that and because I'm still working... but now I cant take my eyes off of this bottle just thinking of having some when everyone is asleep and then getting some cocaine..."
37,1," I just found this sub, and I figured I'd share a little bit since I haven't been able to get to a meeting in awhile anyway with the virus stuff going on. 

I am an addict in recovery, I have been clean for over 3 years at this point, and just based on where I was at my lowest I'm truly blessed to have the life I have now. This pandemic and quarantine has been tough. I was laid off this week with rent and bills looming, and a young daughter who I need to care for and feed. I'm pretty scared about not having medical coverage for us anymore. I've been extremely stressed and not sure how I'm going to be able to manage financially. I applied for unemployment as soon as I got laid off but who knows how quickly that will be here, and I doubt it will be enough anyway.

I posted on [r/Assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/) yesterday because I figured it was worth a shot. I was in a much more emotional place yesterday and wrote a pretty heartfelt and vulnerable post detailing my life, my struggles with addiction, how I was at my lowest, and how I've since then made amends and gotten my life together. I figured even if no one could help me I could at least talk to some people going through a similar situation and commiserate.

As soon as I posted I got a couple DMs of people with brand new accounts phishing for my bank info. Fine. Scummy thing to do but scammers are scummy and this isn't my first time on the internet. No harm no foul. But after that I just received vitriolic message after vitriolic message. Messages telling me I deserved to lose my job, that I didn't deserve to even have a child, fuck junkies, I'm a piece of shit, all of the usual things. Again, it's nothing I haven't heard at one point in my life or another, and honestly things that I have thought about myself in the past, but just the amount of hate on a sub dedicated to assisting people really shocked me. I'll be the first to admit that I was selfish and hurt those closest to me during active addiction, but my relationship with most of those people is better than it has ever been right now. I've made amends and it's frankly no one else's business.

I thought that public perception was starting to shift a bit, at least on Reddit which seems to flaunt it's liberalism and acceptance. But I guess not. I've had a hard week, I'm stressed about how I'm going to get through the next couple months, and I haven't really been able to make it to any meetings lately because of everything going on. It's just really not what I wanted to hear yesterday especially after opening myself up and getting vulnerable asking stranger's for assistance which isn't something I've ever been super comfortable doing. But it reminded me that there are a lot of sick people out there. Addicts have easy symptoms to point to when they are using drugs or alcohol and people tend to push them to get help. But there are a lot of people that are depressed and just want to hurt others because they're hurting themselves, or they're bored, or they have some void to fill. With people like that, who really could benefit from therapy or self exploration, it's harder to say you need to stop everything you're doing and go work on yourself; especially when admitting there's a problem may come to them even less readily than it does for someone using drugs or alcohol. 

Despite  all my current problems I am so grateful for the life that I have now, and I know that one way or another we'll make it through. Just be thankful for wherever you are at because I truly believe that addicts - in recovery or not - are all special people. We've been given the chance to better ourselves and the rest of humanity that not a lot of people get. So if you have 25 years clean or you just got high but feel like you're getting sick of this lifestyle just know that you are special and you can do whatever you put your mind to. And if you need any help along the way there will always be others here to help you."

Recently, life has been putting me through a lot. I broke up with my boyfriend, meaning that now, I quite literally have nobody. Never in my life, did I ever have anybody. Not a single person to provide with the warmth and connection one needs.
Drugs provided that for me. And I just wanted to feel that sense of warmth and comfortable numbness again, instead of facing my pain.
I get so envious when I see people happy, with friends, in relationships living life to the fullest, while I am stuck in bed because the crippling feeling of loneliness is haunting me again.

it was getting extremely bad since October 2019, and progressively worse within the past month or so. I've overdosed, nearly choked to death on my own vomit, etc.

the behaviour and who I was is disturbing me, and I feel deeply embarrassed.

51,1,"I have been drinking close to a fifth a day for a little while. Alcohol is not my DOC. My DOC is heroin. Well, heroin/opioids/cocaine/benzos. I had a good bit of clean time, few months, then around a year, then a few months, then a few months, etc. Was in the rooms for that. I am on suboxone now after I relapsed last year and went on the first real run I'd been on in a long time shooting heroin, and some meth and coke.

I don't really wanna quit drinking yet, might wanna slow down though. I dunno what community is best for me rn, I posted in CA a minute ago, I love that place but I also need to get my other addiction problems in line.

I live in an area of the country where cheap and powerful meth is everywhere. I also can get coke. The particular city I'm in now has heroin but it's too expensive. I'm on suboxone and most of the time that helps me, but once every month or two the urge to shoot something takes me over, and I end up slamming ice or coke..

I would do dope but it's harder to obtain and even tho its high quality its more expensive than I would like to pay, not to mention that I hate stimulants without downers so every time I do them like that it keeps me away for about a month after.. dope on the other hand is amazing to me and what happened with my last relapse was I got a great plug a good prices and high quality heroin and I couldn't stop after that

I moved away from there for my own good and I have stayed off the hard shit with the exception of a once a month/two months slip on stims and the drinking the last few weeks.

I have terrible anxiety problems that I can't get a hold of.

56,1,"Today i‚Äôm 1 year sober from MDMA &amp; cocaine. I have no one to share this with, so thought i would just post here, because i feel the need to say it somewhere so fuck it. I thought i would never be happy or feel content enough with life without M &amp; C. And even some days it‚Äôs still hard because i sometimes fantasize about taking it again and how it would feel but i realize more that the fantasy of it sounds better and more exciting than the actual taking of it. I strive to be 100% real and one thing that motivates me to not take this stuff is the realization that everything is fake when you‚Äôre on it. Your feelings toward a person, your actions, what you say etc. I fucking hated when i thought about what i did, what i said and that it didn‚Äôt resignate at all with who i am. I can say that i do not miss the nights where i couldn‚Äôt sleep. I don‚Äôt miss the guilt trips and promising that next time i won‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt miss having a cigarette at the crack of dawn looking at the sunrise with no sleep making myself think it was beautiful while i was a fucking mess. I don‚Äôt miss being sick and having no energy because of this shit. That also helps as motivation, thinking of the aftermath. My mental health has gotten way better. But this has also been very lonely, still is to be honest. I don‚Äôt really have friends. But i‚Äôd rather be lonely than be high with people. I have a very big problem with trusting people. Being high meant avoiding my problems and being sober i had to face them all and i am still learning about myself to this day. Being high was like receiving a hug for a while and then getting beat down. But the beat down didn‚Äôt even bother me in the beginning because the high was enough for me, shit it was more than enough. It was something telling me it loved me, something that made me feel like i didn‚Äôt need anybody. It gave me confidence, it threw all my problems away. But damn, what a mask it wears. 
Even after this 1 year journey so far with tears and loss i fucking love waking up fresh in the morning. I love working on my mental health. I love staying in and doing things that benefit for me and my knowledge. I love going to sleep with no accelerated heart beat to keep me up. I love having a walk or chilling by myself somewhere, listening to music and writing and with an added cigarette. Oh that reminds me, anyone else smoke like 100 cigs when on a high? fuck that was crazy. Funny when i think about it. My friend who i mostly got high with, we like lived ate and breathed cigarettes. I smoke a lot less now but i have one occasionally. 


My next obstacle is alcohol. I‚Äôve been sober from that for 3 weeks, initially 3 months but i relapsed. I went so much harder on the drugs than the alcohol but i still have the tendency to binge so i‚Äôd rather get it out of my life alltogether. Also i am 20 years old, for anyone who‚Äôs young on here that‚Äôs also thinking of getting sober or is on the journey, it definitely can be done at a young age, and if youre on the journey: high five motherfucker.  It‚Äôs hard because fuck when you‚Äôre sober from alcohol &amp; drugs you see how much it‚Äôs used &amp; normalized in the teenage world. Hell, alcohol is normalized almost everywhere and in all age worlds.

To everyone currently getting sober: let‚Äôs kick ass and remember it‚Äôs okay to not feel okay about this shit, i hope to fuck that you cry, let it all out, we‚Äôve been numbing it. Embrace your ugly and your beautiful !!!! Accept that shit ! Fuck being perfect cause it‚Äôs boring

57,1,"I‚Äôm a 16 year old and I have known for a long time that I have a serious drug problem. Pretty much since the first time I ever tried them. 

My main problem is with Vyvanse and Adderall. Had multiple 6-7 month bouts of addiction where I was taking 200mg a day sometimes. And also even my prescribed amount would get me higher than pretty much every other drug I have ever tried, so it was very very easy to have a problem. It‚Äôs not just this though, I have stolen, cheated, lied, done anything I could to get any kind of drugs. My favorites are weed, some benzos, and DXM. 
But I feel like I get addicted to pretty much any drug I try and just can‚Äôt stop doing them once I start.

I got sober off of vyvanse ~1.5 months ago, had a REEEEALLY nasty detox. Thought I could use other drugs but not vyvanse, and was sorely mistaken. I have lost myself in everything else and am now realizing that I can‚Äôt have any of it without having all of it.
So I want to get fully sober, which I know would require making some big changes. One of which I hoped would be going to NA or AA. But I feel like I really won‚Äôt fit in there. I am so young, and my addiction has not lasted very long at all, and has been very very minor. I doubt there‚Äôs any real gate keeping happening there but I fear I‚Äôll just feel like I don‚Äôt belong because everyone else will be a lot more fucked up than me."
60,1,"This happened to a friend of mine a few years ago and the original discussion wasn't in english, so this will be a recreation of what I remember from what he told me:

My friend had saved up some money over the years and decided to use that money for a down payment on a 2-bedroom apartment. 
He had been living with his parents up until that point, so he underestimated how expensive living alone was. (there is an entire other story here, but it would make the post far too long and isn't relevant to what happened next)

My friend decided to find a room mate so he posted the details on our local version of craigslist.
""Bedroom for rent in 2-bedroom apartment. Would be sharing living room, bathroom, kitchen and balcony with roommate""

A woman contacted him the next day and said she was interested in the apartment, he set up a tour so she could come see the place. (for the record, men and women being roommates is not that unusual here)

He showed her the kitchen, living room, balcony, bathroom and the available bedroom. 
After the tour she asked him about the other bedroom, which triggered the following conversation:

Friend: That's mine, it's not available for rent.

ChoosingBeggar: Well shouldn't I see it anyway?

F: I guess? (opens the door)

CB: Hmmm, would you be leaving the TV and console behind when you move out?

F: (confused) I'm not moving out.

CB: WHAT? So you would be living here?

F: Yes...?

CB: Then why would I be paying?

F: Because you would be living here as well?

CB: Well this changes everything.

Turns out she thought she would rent the whole apartment for the listed price (which was less than the average rent for a studio apartment, let alone a 2-bedroom one) AND she thought she could rent the second bedroom to someone else and keep the money.

F: Sorry, but I'm only renting that bedroom.

CB: Well then you need to cut the price

F: The price is already low, its not going down.

CB: Why don't you just move out? The rent here is very cheap and you seem to be making lots of money, you can afford a better place. Then I can talk to the owner and get this place myself.

F: This IS my place, I AM the owner.

CB: Then why should I pay rent?

F: Because this is NOT your apartment but you would be living here.

CB: But if I live here it would be my apartment.

Eventually, my friend snaps and tells her to just get out, she keeps going on and on ""I don't make that much money!"", ""You are obviously rich!"", ""Who buys an apartment?"" and on and on.
She eventually gets out and he calls us to tell the story. 

A few weeks later, she calls him up to ask if the room is still available. It wasn't and she just hung up on him."
61,1,"It's been one week since I've tasted alcohol. I didn't just taste it, I drank it like a kid loves juicy juice. I haven't slept well the past few days and I'm starting to feel less. What I mean is, I'm not feeling the good things from positive people in my life as much as I remember them. My SO is either being distant or I'm just paranoid. My friends either don't want to talk to me, or I'm the one who's made it seem like I don't want to talk. 

I have so much going on in my head. I'm going to post this and read replies. I just need somebody to listen(read). I feel so alone."
62,1,"Recently, my parents found out about my drug use (mainly amphetamine), and have been forcing me to go sober. When they found out they freaked out and basically took everything that I had and made it impossible for me to buy any more drugs. They are the type of people think that all drugs are bad, except for legal ones, and are making me stop because they are worried about my health. They are unwilling to change their beliefs on drugs or do any research about drugs. They cannot accept me living a life where I use any drugs, even just occasionally. Now I understand their actions are out of love and care for me, but I just don't agree with them wanting me to be sober.

 I'll admit I've been dependent on amphetamine for a few months now and at times I may have used too much, but when this has happened I have always managed to eventually cut back down. I do want to reduce my usage, but I don't want to stop. The thing is that I don't think that my drug usage made my life any worse than before, in fact, I think that it improved my quality of life. Before my amphetamine use, I was severely depressed, unmotivated to do anything, and had difficulty concentrating on certain tasks for most of my life. Drugs have made me more sociable, better at school, and just happier in general. 

I do want to keep using amphetamine at therapeutic doses, as I think that the positives and improvements in my quality of life caused by my usage outweigh the negative health effects. I mean I don't even think that amphetamine is that unhealthy. I am aware of the damage it can cause to the brain if it is abused, and the slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate it can cause, but I still don't see it as that unhealthy. It is also safer than a lot of other stimulants as it doesn't directly interfere with channels in the heart. I think that the most amount of damage amphetamine can potentially do is due to lack of sleep, but I don't go on amphetamine binges and try to get 8hrs of quality sleep every night. 

So then why should I go sober? I have tried going sober a few times, and each time I have waited long enough for most of the withdrawal effects to dissipate, but every time I do, I just realize that my old life sucked and that my life isn't worth living sober, so I go back to using."
63,1,"i relapsed a few weeks ago. At first, it was just smoking weed then it devolved into a few day long coke bender. at first i was in denial, thinking ""it's not that bad..."" additionally, friends who have struggled with addiction have reminded me not to be too hard on myself about a relapse. However, my mother is visibly upset and angry with me for relapsing- how do i try not to be too hard on myself while recognizing the hurt i have caused others by relapsing?"

68,1,"2 years clean! Decided to tell my story; to help people, for self healing, and just to get the shit down. Will try and keep it as short I can but it's a life story so I can only do that so well.

I was born in a little market town in the UK about an hour from London and an hour from Birmingham, bang inbetween. Not a really *bad* town, but not a really *good* one, either. A mix of working class, middle class and upper class. Mainly white, some immigration. Overspill from neighbouring cities. Your typical town.

Was born to middle-class parents but in a predominantly working class area. I'd consider my childhood an average childhood; my parents did their best: there were heated arguments between them, *sure.* There were things that happened in my childhood that could possibly be attributed to my later struggles, *sure.* But it was clear that they wanted the best for me and did everything they could do to try and make sure I had a good life.

But I wasn't like the other kids. Never really felt like I 'fitted in' anywhere. Always felt outcasted. Possibly undiagnosed with mental health conditions. Definitely hyper. Definitely a nuisance. Seemed to attract trouble. I didn't back down to kids who saw me as a potential victim. Got a few beatings. Pakistanis and blacks used to target me especially because I was the well-spoken, weirdo, blonde kid. It let them vent the racism they'd received onto someone less powerful.

When I was 12 I went to a secondary school that was slightly out of town. It was better than the local town school. This was one way that I could try to avoid going down the wrong route. It all started off well; pretty good grades, reasonably happy.. at this point there was no reason to believe that I would become the person I later became.

Around 13 I started to get involved in trouble. I started to mix with the small group of townies that went to the school. I started to enjoy being 'bad'. Being 'bad' brought me popularity to some kids, and feared by others. I started to enjoy having some sort of 'label' - I wasn't the soft little blonde kid anymore, I was the rebellious kid that didn't give a fuck.

Skipping class, smoking, fighting, setting fire to stuff, breaking school rules, stealing, all very minor things. But it gave me a rush. And my peers respected me, and I respected *them*. All townie kids with varying backgrounds but who all shared one common goal; to have as much fun as we could whilst avoiding as much education as we could.

Smoking cigarettes led to smoking weed led to drinking alcohol led to doing solvents led to just wanting to high and drunk on whatever we could, whenever we could. My parents could see that I was starting to go down a slippery slope and they tried to intervene, but this just made me more determined to live how *I* wanted to live. Finally I'd found some comfort in something. Finally I'd found some friends.

At 14 I was heading towards expulsion, so I left the school before it happened and went to the main town school. I knew some kids from around my area that went to the school so it wasn't like I was going to be there on my own. But they knew that I was trouble and thought it probably best that I was avoided. It wasn't long before I was hanging around with the wrong people at this school, too.

But this school wasn't as strict, so it was easier to get away with shit. And with it being easier to get away with shit, it meant that I was getting away with more, and doing more. So my drug use escalated, and before I knew it I was doing ecstacy, LSD, mushrooms and speed. Sometimes even whilst *at* school.

I was probably a few months into my first year at the new school when I stabbed a kid which I was suspended for. During the suspension they decided to expel me. I appealed the decision and managed to get back into the school on a technicality - the rules at the time meant that a school couldn't suspend you and later expel you. I was then let back into the school by the national school board.

Hanging around the local park in the evenings meant that I started hanging around with some of the older lot. Crack addicts, heroin addicts, people involved in drug dealing and burglary, so on and so forth. They started ticking drugs to me to sell in school and offered me protection if anything was to go wrong. But I was the young one, so although they let me into their group, I was also the one that they'd take their frustration out on if they had a bad day, or whatever. I got a slap now and then. I was humiliated now and then. I didn't feel as accepted as I had been by my peers in my school. It was like I was back to square one, back at primary school. The victim.

One day one of them went to give me a hiding but I retaliated and beat him up quite bad. I had to show them I wasn't just a 'pussy' they could knock about. That day I made the decision I was going to have to fight through life if I wanted to *get* through life.

In my last year I was going to get expelled from school for drug dealing but with my GCSE's just a week or two away, the school allowed me to stay. So I managed to finish school. Shitty grades though. When I left school i had no prospects, no hope really. And I was now in what I now look back at and realise was a gang. Not a Mexican drug cartel by any means, but it was a gang.

I realised my life was heading in the wrong direction and so I decided to make a change. Get out of the shit. So I applied to college. Stopped hanging around with the people I was hanging around with. Realised I needed to stop drinking and doing drugs, and made a real attempt to quit. I was only 16 when I realised I was an addict and that it was 'all or nothing' for me. I absolutely *had* to stop it all.

But I already had a reputation and was associated with the wrong people and so not long later I got jumped by another crew in town and got stabbed in the arm and in the side of the head. I tried to fight back, but didn't manage to make much difference against a gang of about 10. Ambulance and police were called to the scene. The doctor said that if it had been an inch closer to my temple then I could have died. Proper shit me up. But I was at college now, I wasn't going to be dragged down into the mess. So I didn't retaliate, and I didn't get my boys.

The police were constantly on my case trying to get me to grass. The guy who'd stabbed me in the head was an interest to them, they wanted to put him away. They had witnesses statements, all they needed was *my* statement. I made a big error. I made a statement and testified. I was now a grass.

I carried on my course at college but couldn't stay clean and was using drugs and alcohol daily. I was getting into fights regularly. I started hanging around with the wrong crowd again. Confused about who I was; was I a good guy trying to be bad or a bad guy trying to be good? I'd gone from the well-spoken blonde kid who wanted to do good in life, to the rebellious teenager who didn't give a fuck, to a very confused young man - I now spoke differently, I had a skinhead, I was addicted to drugs and alcohol, hanging around with people signing on the dole.... but now I wanted to do *good* in life again, and I was trying to get an education. I had a lot of internal conflict with some serious identification issues.

But I kept trying to quit. Every other monday it seemed like I was trying to pack it all in. But it never worked. I never had the tools, no meetings, no recovery pals, nothing. It was all self-will. And with being surrounded by people who just wanted to get high and cause mayhem, I was inevitably going to fail every time.

Two years later the guy I'd testified against got released and I bumped into him at a party, I offered to fist-fight him to settle things but his cousin stabbed me in the back of the head a few times. Needless to say I didn't talk to the police this time.

I finished my course and had the chance to get away and go to university, so I did. This was my chance to get away, and so I enrolled at a university course at a local city. But the same thing would loop time and time again. Try to get clean, get clean, fall back into the madness. On and on it goes. Even being *away from my home town* I couldn't do it.

Students make good customers so a lot of drugs were sold. Going back and forth to pick up the drugs, I had runners in my local town who were selling for me whilst I sold drugs at the university too. Doors got kicked down and people got hurt. Students tried to take me for a mug and got hurt. A lot of people got hurt. By this point I'd managed to accumulate a few black marks on my criminal record but managed to narrowly avoid jail, being at university seemed to work in my favour when it came to standing before a judge.

And so I finished university (lowest grade) but I finished it. No one from my circle had even gone to college, let alone university. But I'd got an education. Did the bare minimum but I did it. And back to my home town I went.

But I couldn't get work *anywhere* \- no one wanted to employ someone with a criminal record, and so the selling of drugs continued. Me and my associates were now selling a lot of cocaine, using taxis we paid off to get us around, having pouches stitched into our boxers for hiding drugs, delegating each other different areas to cover. Of course it was all gonna end in tears.

That was when shit was about to get really messy. Someone owed one of us some money but wasn't paying it so we went to his flat to stab him up, and he ran away. We drove around the estate looking for him but he was nowhere to be seen. We gave up the search and carried on.

A few days later a flat we were selling drugs from had the door bust open and a gang from south east London entered with a knife to my friends throat... they then robbed us at knife point and I got stabbed a couple times. A couple friends also got cut. I decided I needed to get away again - I couldn't be fucked with this drama. The money wasn't as important as *my life.*

I managed to get a job with a third party company travelling around the country making money for charities. It was a travelling job so I could stay away from my home town as often as I wanted. So the drug dealing stopped, but the drug taking didn't. I was smoking crack and heroin whilst signing people up for children's charities. Pretty fucked up really.

A year later and the company went bust and I was back in Shitsville again. 25 years old, no job, heavily addicted to drugs and alcohol, and people wanted me back on the corners with them. It was time to give this abstinence and sobriety another go. And so I did.

This was my first solid effort at getting clean. I cut everyone off, got into the gym, ate healthy, drank healthy, managed *7 months clean*. Got myself a job lifeguarding - life was good. Finally I'd managed to get a good amount of clean time. *Finally* life was starting to make some sort of sense.

**But** the swimming pool found out about my criminal record and I lost the job. I was at risk *again.*

About a week later I was walking down the high street and I walked into a pop-up shop where a guy had a pouch on and was sat at the back, looking a bit disheartened by the fact his shop was empty. I told him I'd just lost my job because of my criminal record and if he ever needed flyers handing out, to let me know. ""Nah we'll be alright"" he said - so I left the shop and forgot all about it.

About a week later I was in Citizens Advice Bureau explaining my problem: I couldn't get work anywhere, what could I do? Suddenly my phone rings ""would you like to manage my shop?"" the guy asks.... needless to say I was sat in front of him within minutes.

It was crazy - turned out the guy was a successful entrepreneur who had been the European distributor of New Era baseball caps amongst other things but had now left New Era and started up a new business. He was in the shop that day as he liked to get involved at ground level with his businesses. Within moments he was handing me the keys to the shop. What were the odds? I was now manager of a high street store. Things were on the *up*. All I had to do was get the sales up enough to instill the faith into him that opening the store officially was worth it. And that's exactly what I did.

But a night before the grand opening of the store, I had a red bull. A red bull led to a cigarette. A cigarette led to a beer, to two beers, three, four, weed, coke......

I woke up the next day at 10am with my staff member calling me ""where are you?"" I rushed to the store and realised I didn't have my key. Had to call a locksmith on a busy Saturday to come and get me into the shop. Spent the whole day of the 'grand' opening with a *huge* hangover and a very unhappy boss at the other end of the line. ""You've scored enough brownie points for me to let you off with a warning"" he assured me.

But I was back on the drugs. Parties in the basement, taking girls round the back, more criminal behaviour I won't go into and basically just fucking everything up again. Sales dropped rapidly and he closed the store, but he assumed it was because of a bad new year of sales and not me being really shit at the job. I think it was a bit of both.

Not long after leaving, he called me up and offers me a job in central London, running the Soho store. Great, *another* chance to get away. I wont fuck it up *this* time. Time to make this change once and for all. (Again) More like four thousand, three hundred and twenty thrice for all.

I managed about 3 months clean until the bright lights and debauchery of Soho led me back into the dark side. I was using prostitutes daily, smoking crack like it was going out of fashion, and just plain and simply fucking everything all over again. When was it going to *end?* I was doomed to fuck it all up and end up back in town again. Something needed to change.

Then something happened - a Christian girl came into my life and invited me to church. Told me I could change and that God could help. I was so anti-god that I wanted to tell her where to go but I loved this girl and wanted to keep her in my life. And so I went.

Shit changed. *I* changed. I packed everything in *again.* But this time I had something new to help me along the way, this time I had *God.* I prayed, I went to church - surrounded by people who wanted the *best* for me, I read the Bible, and I had a beautiful woman in my life who truly *loved* me. It was working in a way it had never worked before.

But I had issues with the church. There were things I was being told that I didn't fully agree with. There was severe internal conflict because as much as Christianity was helping me, I just didn't *believe* in it. I sent myself mad trying to convince myself that it was all true but deep down inside of me, I didn't think it was. I was scared shitless because I knew that leaving it all would probably lead me back down the same route as before. So guess what...

Eventually I left Christianity. And within weeks I was back to square one *again.* An old girlfriend from my teens had contacted me and she came to London to visit, and we had a meal, and we drank, and.... well, you know what happened.

And so we started a relationship, and a few weeks later she told me she was pregnant. Then it all hit the fan. I lost my job. I got evicted. My business I was running on the side was failing. The girl I was having a child with split up with me. It was all falling apart ***again.*** I had nowhere to go and nowhere to turn. And so back to my hometown I went.

That was the start of a rapid downfall that got *very* dark and *very* quickly. My associates were now deep into crime and were involved in some really fucked up shit. My drug use escalated to levels it had never gone to before. And I was doing things that I'd never done before. I was rapidly losing my soul.

Before my first child was born, I got *another* girl pregnant. I now had no money, no job, a serious crack-cocaine and heroin addiction that was literally tearing my soul apart - and I had 2 children on the way. Things were going pear shaped very quickly and I was in no position to be responsible of children. I needed to make some money, I needed to do something - and *quick.*

And so I set up a business - a clothing manufacturing business. And started to spend a lot of time working on that, whilst using drugs and alcohol regularly. My obsessive nature was applied to the business and very quickly it developed into a very profitable business with huge potential.

Before long I had enough money to move back to London and start developing the business there. I started to get big clients, and was making *ridiculous* amounts of money. This was potentially going to turn into a very lucrative business but the lifestyle I was living and the errors I was making due to being so immersed in drug use meant that it was destined to all end in tears.

There were then allegations made against me that really fucked me up and I didn't have the focus I needed to keep working on my business, so I left it to two colleagues to look after whilst my personal life span further and further out of control. By this point I was developing severe drug psychosis and had some psychotic episodes which led me to nearly dying, being thrown in jail or committed to a mental institute *multiple* times. I was so fucking lost it was crazy. I led a miserable, depressed, suicidal, very complicated existence. Things got *very* intense.

Eventually the potentially huge business turned into a failed one and I upset a lot of associates and customers. There were people looking for me to do me in, and I was in serious danger. I tried to fix things but I couldn't. I had to get out of London before people found me. And so I left London and moved to a different city with absolutely nothing to my name other than a bag of clothes and a blow-up mattress, living in a place that smelt of dog piss and was filled with rats. I'd gone from a budding entrepreneur: selling clothes to high profile customers - to a broke, depressed, lonely man with a price on his head and *serious* mental health issues.

This was when the prospect of serious jail time, permanent insanity or certain death became *very likely* if I wasn't to sort my act out. And so I decided it was time to get into some recovery meetings *(long time coming, I know)* \- to listen to what was being said, word-for-word, and do *literally anything* that I could possibly do to stay clean. I'd gone to a couple meetings in the past but the words 'God' and 'step 4' had scared me a way. This time I didn't give a shit, whatever I was told to do, I was gonna *do it.*

I started to attend face-to-face meetings every day. Sometimes 2, sometimes 3. I did any fellowship that had the letter A at the end of it. It all applied to me. AA, NA, CA, GA, SA, SAA, SLAA - you name it - I was there.

I shared whenever I could, I reached out whenever I could, I went out with people from recovery, I spent hours on the phone to people in recovery... I cried, I laughed, I prayed, I meditated, I read recovery literature, I got a sponsor, I did step work. Man, I don't think there was anything I *didn't do.* I was *living* recovery.

I must have got about 4 months clean when I fell off the wagon *again.* This was so frustrating because it was like I'd hit the lowest rock bottom possible, and used every method of recovery possible, but I was *still relapsing.* What was going to have to happen for me to finally buck my ideas up?

I jumped back on the wagon again and again, and I did everything I could. Another 2 months clean. A *relapse.* Another month. A *relapse.* What the actual *fuck.*

But something had changed in my brain. I knew it was possible now. I'd acquired so many tools, and I'd received so much love, love that had been missing for so long. I had people in my life that *understood* me. I had a 'God of my own understanding.' I was doing work on myself - day in, day out. I could finally see some light at the end of this very dark tunnel.

Then 2 years ago, on 19th March 2018, I woke up on my blow-up bed, staring at the ceiling after my 3746372nd relapse. And I said something to myself that seemed so fucking simple, but when I said it, there was so much clarity in the moment that I really understood it for what it was..

""If you don't ever want to do drugs again for the rest of your life, then you need to *stop* doing drugs. It's *that* simple. For *20 years* you've been trying to do this. If you really want to do it, then *do it.* Fucking *stop,* man.*""*

No visit from God, no third-eye opening transcendental moment taking me to another realm, no amazing mind-blowing epiphany. Just me, realising something in the deepest clarity for the first time in my life. If I want to stop, then I've gotta fucking stop. And so that was it, I stopped. And I haven't looked back since.

**Today**

I'm not going to say that the past two years of my life have been easy, because they've been *anything but.* In some ways, the last two years have been harder than the 20 years in my using and drinking. That's the *truth.* I still have repercussions of my past haunting me, I have an ongoing case with the police, I've had issues with the mothers of my children, some more friends have died, shit has been ***hard.*** But guess what? I'm clean. And *that's* what's important. If I was using, there is no way I would have been able to handle some of the things that have happened in the past two years. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be sat here, sane, with a roof over my head. I now have a beautiful relationship with my youngest daughter, I have an amazing relationship with my parents, the best it's ever been in my life... I have friends who love me, male and female, who I can tell that I love and they tell me they love me. I have plans for the future. I have acceptance of the past. Acceptance of the *future.* I have internal peace, understanding, hope. I've learnt so much. And I'm still learning. Life is *finally* beginning to make some sort of sense. 35 years of life and finally I'm starting to get what this is all about. Finally, I feel like *a human.*

If you've made it this far through my post then well done haha! If you're new in recovery, I hope my story brings you some hope that no matter how long you've been trying, recovery *is* possible. If you've been in recovery for a while and are still struggling, then hopefully this story reminds you that there *is* a way out. And anyone else reading it, well I hope it's helped you in some way, too.

Peace &amp; Love people. **I love you!**"
69,1,"I feel like all that stuff was written by some phd whos never actually touched drugs or been immersed in that world. I just find it to be so out of touch and cliche and it just sort of upsets me. I find it‚Äôs so much better to read info from people who‚Äôve actually been through it or at least don‚Äôt write like they‚Äôre a robot. I feel like it‚Äôs harmful because the average addict is probably really put off by that stuff and wants something they can relate to instead of a bunch of overly manufactured shit.

I have no doubt is was probably written with the best of intentions and by people who actually do care but I can‚Äôt see it appealing to the average addict."
70,1,"Hey guys, I (34M) love smoking cigarettes and having a couple drinks at the end of the night, but with Covid-19, I have been absolutely terrified of the damage that it could wreak on me if I were to keep smoking and drinking. 

Recently, I read that the immunosuppressed were the ones having the most difficulty in battling this disease and we all know smoking and drinking suppresses your immune system. 

As of posting this, I am 1 day, 19 hours, and 32 minutes in. 

The way I see it, the further I get away from my last cocktail and cigarette, the better my immune system will be, and therefore the better my odds of surviving this thing. 

Note: I am also walking 3 miles per day, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, Greek yogurt, broccoli, staying hydrated, etc. 

Question is this: is anyone else here quitting or continuing to abstain from an addiction due to the fear of contracting Covin-19?"

Hope everyone is doing well in their recovery.

74,1,"I am 2 weeks in to quitting. I have been using a juul for 1.5 years, a pod or more a day which is the equivalent to a pack of cigarettes. Because you can vape inside, I've gotten used to hitting it while I'm working. I primarily used it when working or playing video games. Maybe it's just the WFH/quarantine from coronavirus and it was a bad time to quit, but *god damn* if I don't just think about it constantly?

I had quit getting drunk for the most part, but I've started day drinking (like 10am) to try and satisfy that itch for it. 

Is it always going to be like this? It's not like I'm physically hurting or anything, it's pretty mild as far as withdrawals go. It's just like... I start opening my drawer and then surprise, there's no pods. I feel like in TV, smokers are frequently depicted as extremely easy to relapse and eager to jump on a hit. Do I ever stop thinking about it? Or does this part eventually pass?"
75,1,"I‚Äôve (F22) been clean from opiates since April 2019, almost a year now. After leaving the detox facility I was in my son (3) and I moved in with my sister (43) until I was more stable and able to provide. We were well on our way out of her home when the coronavirus struck and has forced me into near bankruptcy, I‚Äôm a single mother in the food industry with no support from my boys father. Since we‚Äôve lived with my sister she has undermined every rule I make for my son, she badmouths me to him, she breaks every rule and encourages him to do so as well. She tells him if ‚Äòmommy wasn‚Äôt around and so mean‚Äô he could have xyz all the time. Every time I mention how toxic and awful this is she explodes, and screams at me and anyone who will listen about how I‚Äôm the worst mother on the planet who always puts drugs before my son and if she had it her way she‚Äôd have custody because I have always abused my boy. I have structures, and rules, and expectations of my incredibly bright, mostly kind, genuinely loving little boy, he never has an issue listening to me or when I say no until Auntie comes in and causes a stink, and then he cries and runs to her and talks about how ‚Äòmean‚Äô mommy is. Today after I asked her not to feed him an entire bag of gummy bears + ice cream + a bag of chips 45 minutes before dinner, she directly told my son ‚Äòmommy doesn‚Äôt want you to eat, because mommy wants to spend the money on your food to get high.‚Äô Immediately my son says, ‚Äòyeah! Get high!‚Äô I‚Äôm furious and fed up. I‚Äôm always calm and rational, I never ask her for anything financially, pay my share, stay to myself, and keep my mouth shut until she involves my son. Seriously considering going to a family shelter, but that means potential exposure to this fucking virus. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I‚Äôm crumbling in this bitches wake."
76,1,It's been 10 days
77,1,"From MDMA, Ketamine, Weed, Alcohol

It's been really really rough, But Im so glad i didn't give in because the cravings and temptations are fading now, Im not getting the urge to go out on a friday night and get pinged or fucked.

Man I love being sober."
78,1,"Things got crazy last night and I‚Äôm still joyful and it‚Äôs terrifying, but wonderful.

I‚Äôm having a freaky experience and I‚Äôm not ready to say it out loud, so here goes;

Last night I went outside to calmly smoke a cigarette and started talking to myself.  I was nervous about sanity/insanity, dying/living, drinking/not drinking, quitting cigarettes/smoking a carton...I‚Äôm hopeful you know how this goes...when I felt like a person from my past whom I love and is deceased and I only met via Google Duo, is talking to me and guiding me.  When I tell myself it‚Äôs my subconscious and I‚Äôm ‚Äúthat strong,‚Äù I hear this person take the credit! They were quite the tease...*eye roll*

Can anyone relate?"
79,1,"\~and feel good\~ too crazy for it feel ""better"" being sober??? 

anyone?? 

what u like i been sober 9 months (basically) 

except right now i am chillin alone again again again and decided to drink alone which is common for me- ANYWAY THAT PART IS UNRELATED.

80,1,"This feels like a long time. Anyways I've never had anyone to talk to about being sober before. None of my friends know, so I'm hoping I can celebrate here. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/32jz0mf) a link to my progress on the app. A few days after 200, but still."

82,1,"Happy St. Patrick's Day, all my fellow sober lads &amp; lassies! Check out our [latest non-alcoholic beer review](https://youtu.be/5A-IVhr-PLI), the Guinness-brewed NA amber, Kaliber. Disclaimer, there's a low level of alcohol in this one so ingest with caution. :)"
83,1,"Morning.
Coming up on five months cold turkey sober off 11 years of daily H and benzodiazepine addiction. 
No suboxone/methadone, no NA, just Netflix, the gym, and the occasional seizure the first couple months.

So this sub has been helpful in many ways, but lately it‚Äôs very hard to relate to most of the posts in here. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs great you‚Äôre no longer battling your ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù to smoking weed or having the occasional drink; but Jesus Christ I see most of the content in here now and literally cringe before saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cute‚Äù and closing Reddit.

So Is there a recovery based sub for people who battled real substances for years+ and came out the other side?"
84,1,"Zoom seems to be the thing in lots of areas.

Anyone doing it? How‚Äôs it going? What are some of the challenges?

It‚Äôs taking a minute to get it set up where I live. Worried about newcomers, even when there‚Äôs a steady online schedule."
85,1,"I guess I just fell into the trap of thinking I could handle something new because it wasn‚Äôt Alcohol. Dumb mistake.  I know now not to mess with anything at all. I‚Äôm glad Benzos and uppers were never my thing and now because of the pitfall opiates put me in, j will never try getting into them again.    I know now that I am finally done. My life is going to go up from here on out."
86,1,"I'm about 6 months pregnant. I take subutex and have been told not to stop taking it until after my baby is born as it can cause miscarriage to stop. But the requirement for the subutex program I'm in is group therapy meetings for an hour and a half, twice a week. The group has about 15 people in it, in a small room, in a close circle. I am very hesitant to go tomorrow due to coronavirus. Everyone is saying avoid public interaction as much as possible, but no one in my area takes it seriously, no precautionary measures are being taken. This virus could lead to me being hospitalized and possibly hurt my baby and me, but not attending meetings is considered not working towards treatment and complying. I'm not sure what to do?"
87,1, I was clean for like 13 months but suffered a slip-up recently. I was trying to score today and I ran into a girl I used to hang with back when I had a bad habit. She didn‚Äôt even sound like the same person. She spoke slower and was slurring and just sounded like someone who was mentally impaired. Beyond what someone whos just overly intoxicated sounds like though. I‚Äôm assuming she suffered brain damage during an overdose and it‚Äôs just awful. I mean honestly she was a bad person. She has BPD and was untreated. I‚Äôm not trying to demonize bpd people because I know how hard  it is to have that disorder but she was just terrible person. She tried to steal from me multiple times and always seemed to be angling to try and get shit out of me (I would only hang with her when I couldn‚Äôt find drugs any other way). But it was still hard to see her like that and I felt bad for her. I guess I just feel lucky too. I overdosed last week and no one found me til the morning and somehow I didn‚Äôt suffer any brain damage (got an MRI and everything). I feel like it‚Äôs a wake up call that I need to quit before it‚Äôs too late.
88,1,"I got sober at 20 years old. I am turning 22 and I can't take it sometimes!! I go to bars and watch my friends drink or I see posts of people drinking online. Sometimes i enter this obsessive phase where i just imagine myself downing alcohol and doing cocaine. Most days I can handle it, but other days are really hard. What's weird is that I have the strongest urge to drink yet I am so terrified of it at the same time. I want to be able to drink socially but I have a fear of feeling out of control (or not in control of my body)."
89,1,"(Don‚Äôt Read Further if vomiting triggers you)

It was 35-45 about minutes after but I‚Äôm not sure how much is absorbed by the stomach then. Not sickness, my cat threw up, I‚Äôd just had a coffee and therefore set me off. Normally I can cope but it was particularly smelly. It‚Äôs never happened before on methadone. 

Obviously if it affects my dose for the day I‚Äôll have to mentally prepare. It‚Äôs pick up day tomorrow so I wait longer.

91,1,"Has it helped you with recovery?

What benefits has it given you? 

I'm filling my spare time with going to church, making music and the next step for me is signing up for Muay Thai kickboxing."
92,1,"Hello all, i will keep this simple, i am going to meetings, and creating a routine for a fresh start in life. Unfortunately i only find my thoughts centering on weaknesses in my growth and value it less and less. I understand that if i want to really recover i have to learn to accept the good and bad not just the bad. Please help or if i didn't properly explain, then let's me know so i update. I hate how ungrateful these feelings make me feel."
93,1,"So, it's just soo humbling to say IM SOBER. November 3rd 2018, I entered a 90 day recovery program in Columbus, Ms. I think the obvious truth is that I was afraid.. I had never been to rehab. Like most recovered alcoholics, I had to hit rock bottom to realize I was destroying my life. I pushed all the people that loved and cared about me away. 

It hurts when your friends dont want to have any thing to do with you any more. Your family only calls to make sure that you are still breathing. Evan my cat slept in the other room because at night I was so rowdy and beligerant. One moment I was happy-go-lucky. Then the next I was angry-violent-suicidal. 

Today I have rid my self of that obsession and have begun to live a purpose driven life. Ugh humbled is about the best I can describe this experience. 500 days sober! 

I decided to start a channel on YouTube. We are asking addicts of all kinds to be completely transparent and to tell their stories of addiction. It's almost a HOW TO channel about sobriety. I'd really love some feedback. If you all think the message is clear. If the videos are worth watching. I hope we are reaching people in an honest and genuine way. Let me know! Is this a good idea?

94,1,"I was checking my teen‚Äôs medication to be sure she has been taking it and found 2 Xanax pills mixed in with it. I flushed them. Then I had a long talk with my daughter and her friend.

I wanted to take them badly. In fact, if I found them on a bad day, I probably would have. But today didn‚Äôt. I ran straight to flush them before I could change my mind. I also explained to my daughter how hard it is as an addict to come across drugs in my home.

My daughter has been struggling with her mental health and her best friend gave her the Xanax (which she got from her mother) to help with my daughter‚Äôs panic attacks. I‚Äôm not mad at either of them, we had a good talk and I‚Äôm proud of my daughter for telling the truth and not taking them.

Thanks for listening, I didn‚Äôt want to share this with anyone else."

97,1,"I quit crystal Nov. 25.

Nov. 26th: I moved in with my aunt (New state, new start) to detox/get my shit together 

December 13th: My aunt accused me of stealing her makeup, cigarettes, books, husband. I was working 16 hour days while withdrawing from crystal, so you can guess how that went. I got kicked to the curb. I hope she found her cigarettes.

December 14: I admitted myself to a psych ward. They diagnosed me with bipolar disorder type ii and c-PTSD (oh, and substance abuse disorder, duh)

December 19th: I'd spent the past three days selling myself for my hotel room. Which is kind of funny, cause the last thing my aunt said to me was ""and you're a fucking prostitute"" and, well... ya gotta do what ya gotta do. I broke down after dude left. I was almost four weeks sober, and in two days I'd be back home.
March 13th: today was supposed to be my first day at a new job. I went to shower, couldn't find a towel because my ex fiancee had once again blacked out and pissed himself, using all three towels to lay on. I couldn't find my wallet. My old work pants didn't fit. So I called out. I come home after running errands and my ex is up and drinking, didn't even bother to clean his urine. I give him my usual 'please stop drinking' speech. He gives me the usual 'at least I'm not doing fucking meth'). An hour later I'm at the store and his boss gets on me for multiple reasons, as if it's my fault he shows up drunk and let's her go to voicemail.

So I hit up an old friend and he bought me a 30 bag. It was a little light. I liked it, it wasnt the best shit I've had but it cleared my head and sorted my thoughts. It wasn't worth it though. The meth grime caked my skin. I spent an hour in the shower using all of my face scrubs. I felt clean until I saw my reflection.

I have to go to work in a bit. I would kill for bowl right now. I'm torn between sobriety and escaping."

99,1,"Hey all, I made a post a couple months ago when I hit 5 months free of self harm, well I made it to 7! 


I‚Äôve started planning some more coverups for the older scarring, I really feel like I‚Äôm never going back to where I was, it was the worst 5 years of my life but I think I‚Äôm ready to say it‚Äôs no longer relevant to me

It‚Äôs been hard due to some unhealthy/toxic housing issues at the moment, but it‚Äôs made me feel like even at really bad points I can still stay clean 

5 more months until a year now !"
100,1,"I'll be honest.  I found Reddit while I was looking for the answer/approval I wanted.  I'm glad I'm here, because I got the answer I needed.  I fucked up big time and I am hoping to find someone who has been through what I am going through now and can offer some advice and maybe chat for a bit until I am certain I am back on track.  I need to give some history, so this might be long.  I'll try to be concise in this first post.

In the 90s, I had a catastrophic level addiction to heroin.  I honestly don't know how I survived or how I made it out, but I did.  Almost everyone I knew back then didn't.  The few that did survive kept on using in some form.  Either H or scamming opiates from doctors.

But, I made it out and went on to create a great life.  I became clean, successful, productive. My life today would seem enviable to a lot of people.  It was hard to get here, for sure.  It took a lot of very lonely years where I had to keep away from triggers that seemed to pop up everywhere, but eventually I got to the point where the addiction was in my past.  I did not think about it every day or week or even month.  I occasionally dream about it, but I have learned how to deal with that in a good way.  I know I could never go back to heroin ever.  I'd be willing to bet one taste would have me killing myself all over again in no time.  That is not the issue.

I built this life carefully and chose friends very wisely, I thought.  Here and now, 20 years later I felt so confident and secure.  I never thought that is when you could be your most vulnerable.

I was in a situation where I was unexpectedly slipped a free bag of cocaine from someone who had no idea about my past. Most people in my life today would be shocked to know who I was. I don't know why she did that.  I don't think I give off that vibe at all.  I silently panicked a bit and left.

I had used the stuff as a party drug, but it wasn't a favorite. Never bought it, but never said no to the free stuff.  It was not my thing at all.  I should have thrown that shit out right then and there, but instead I brought it home and locked it in my safe.  And I forgot about it for a while.  Then, one night I was alone and looking for something to do and I decided to just look at it.  If you are going to look, you should give it a sniff too, right?  Just a teeny tiny taste to remember the numb.  Then, I'm convincing myself that I have come this far and I'm strong and I have too much to lose to get hooked on this stuff, and I didn't really like it that much anyway.  If it wasn't a problem THEN, why would it be NOW?  Just one line to see what it feels like now won't hurt, right?  One line and ditch it.  

You know where this is going.

A half a gram later...I feel great.  I'm super focused and productive, but also oddly relaxed.  I did not remember it feeling this way.  I like it!  Get more, you can do it every so often to boost yourself a bit.  So, of course I got more ASAP ""just to have on hand.""  Well, that turned into a little binge.  I didn't even see myself acting so stupid and reckless. I saw everything though the lens of the drugs.  That quick.

So I came here looking for approval of this choice and people for whom this scenario has worked and how they went about it.  Instead, I got the slap I needed.   I was so embarrassed that I deleted the post. Being here has helped me more than I thought I would.  I see myself in so many people here in all stages of addiction and recovery.  It reminds me of the choice I made and how much it's worth.  It reminds me how tragic it all really was.  How much was lost for nothing.  I hadn't thought about these things in a long time.  Maybe I should have.

I only have one person in my life I can talk openly about this with and he is in another country right now.  So I'm here asking for help.

I KNOW I can walk away if I walk away right now.  But I also know I'm an addict and that little voice has been wakened a bit.  I kept it right for almost 20 years.  How do you get this far and fuck it up so well?

Any advice, tips, whatever...I'd appreciate.  Thanks for sticking around till the end.

BTW...the girl who gave it to me is cut out of my life.  I told her why I had to and she respects my request.  She will not have future contact with me.  We only met twice, so not much lost there."

The following link is to a short independent movie me and some friends made over the last year. Its about a bartender who puts her love of art on the back burner to make a ""living"", all the while dealing with her own issues with substance abuse. The film was drawn heavily from the creators own experiences, and deals with the kind of addiction common to many people in the service industry, especially here in Wisconsin. I offer it up as a love letter to those who struggle. We see you, we know you, we are you. There is no easy fix, but sometimes a good first step is to just find your corner of light in the darkness, move forward and hold on. And sometimes a little humor helps the medicine go down.

109,1,"I‚Äôm not afraid of the Coronavirus itself. If I get it, I get it. 

But I‚Äôm concerned about quarantine if I do. My keyworker says not to worry too much but didn‚Äôt explain what would happen when I voiced my concerns. She said I was panicking too much (catastrophizing? she knows I‚Äôm on a waiting list for an autism assessment and believes I may have it so I get treated under the assumption I‚Äôm autistic) If I‚Äôm quarantined at home how would I get my methadone? I‚Äôm on twice weekly pick ups, when I do pick up I have to take it at the pharmacy that day. I have bad anxiety on my best days and I really fear withdrawal if quarantined. This panic is bothering me enough. I had trouble getting paracetamol the other day which I take for chronic pain (not allowed pain meds anymore other than paracetamol and meloxicam, an NSAID). and doctors don‚Äôt like to prescribe it anymore. 

I‚Äôm just anxious about all this. I‚Äôve been on a taper but not been great at it having to go back up temporarily with a view of going down 1mg at a time when I‚Äôm ready and my keyworker didn‚Äôt put my fears at ease. She‚Äôs a great keyworker don‚Äôt get me wrong but didn‚Äôt know about any contingency plans and addicts are not exactly a priority unless at medical risk. I‚Äôm going back up because I‚Äôvs been close to possibly relapsing and other side effects and got ambitious with my last drop.

I hope this all makes sense (I‚Äôm actually diagnosed dyslexic and not the best communicator)."

112,1,"I got sober three months after I turned 21. I had so many old people tell me they spilled more than I drank, tell me I don‚Äôt have a chance, I‚Äôll be dead. Well, here‚Äôs to them. 

I was always the one to not make it. I used to be the good example of what not to do in recovery. 

Today, I‚Äôm 30 with a job I love, a family that for the most part has healed and always helped me on my journey, a sweet little black kitten, and happiness. 

I got high for nine years, started when I was 12. I can now say I‚Äôve been sober as long as the amount of time I was getting high. 

It feels good."

116,1,"The title sums it up. I've been slacking on this particular amends since I got sober, but as usual, I was making it out to be much worse in my head than it actually was. I just wanted to say how grateful I am for these steps. They really do work, but only if you work it."
117,1,"Nearly 3 months sober now and since 15 so for the past near 10 years I've been hiding behind drugs to mask everything. 

Now I'm sober and all these traumatic memories of abuse are like flooding back I'm seeking support the best I can but fuck it's difficult."
118,1,"Going through a lot I met this woman december 2018/january 2019. She was living a rough life. I think she was triggered by a bad break up. She had two children one she had out of high school and one she had about 5-6 years ago. She had custody of neither due to her addiction. She was a beautiful woman, though at this point she damn near skin and bones but I know she had problems with drugs spanning back to high school where her boyfriend of time introduced her and got her hooked on em. I won't hide it she did resort prostitution to get her money. She lived with one of her friends who allowed her in his home he was and is an upstanding ex-military guy letting her in his home rent free/ no expectations of favors. I had never been around an addict before so while hanging out with her I truly did not understand her. I just couldn't fathom her staying up for 24 hours + at a time and she was literally unable to sleep until she would get a dose of her drug of choice. She tried to hide it at first because she thought I would think differently of her after I saw her needle kit, I told her I didn't think differently of her and she warned me she was going to shoot up, I watched her.  

She had a strange speech pattern, she talked very quickly and always mumbled her words, I literally thought it was just an accent from her home state, but it was just the drugs. Whenever she'd shoot up her mind would just go out of it, she would get up and walk around like a zombie just moaning and speaking not even words just incoherent noises, sometimes she would be masturbating herself she would run into walls, into the bed, anything and sometimes end up with bruises. I know she would shoot up before going on a ""date"" sometimes but most times she'd only dose herself up to that zombie state whenever she intended to sleep. And her sleep was strange she could literally sleep for like a whole 15 hours.  

At some point she got into a situation where she owed a drug dealer money, he caused some trouble and her friend kicked her out of his place. I would have gladly invited her to my place, but I stayed with family and I know they wouldn't allow her to stay. I childishly said I'd make them allow her to stay, but she said she wasn't going to run from her problems. Looking back I'd say with addiction there is no running. I bet drug dealers loan out money all the time to addicts, because whatever abuse whatever danger they will always willingly return to a source of their fix I came to realize. For fear of her getting hurt I paid off the money she owed to her dealer true to the debt she didn't have any problems after that, she would reguluarly continue purchasing from this dealer.At this point I did the best I could to get her hotel rooms to stay in to atleast keep her off the street. I make decent money at my job but I gotta say to live in a hotel everyday you have to be rich or be doing something illegal. I'm not proud of it, but she did have to continue her prostitution to pay for that hotel room because I ran broke trying, I could always go back to my families place, but she didn't have anywhere to go, of course this was her only source of money so she was going to do it either way. It was awful to watch but her life literally revolved around drugs and sex for drugs or money to get drugs. I don't personally have a problem with prostitution but when its mixed with drugs it just ain't right, There's a big difference between a woman who wants to make some side money and a woman who will do anything she can to get her fix atleast in my eyes.  

This beautiful shell of a woman didn't have any self worth. She hated prostituting she hated shooting up everyday but she couldn't stop herself. At some point in trying to take care of her I fell for her, but she said she couldn't reciprocate this as she currently felt nothing on the drugs, she really tried to push me into meeting other women and said I could do much better.  

At some point in my long absence from home my family found out who I was hanging around and you better believe my own mother went into snoop mode to get me away from her, she literally somehow got into contact with her mother and whoever had custody of her kids. Honestly my mother blowing everything up like that did some good. She had to go back to her home state and  end up going to rehab to try to keep a relationship with her eldest.  

She had a rocky start up there thought she was immediately jailed after the plane landed for prior charges she had in her home state that she ran out on. She went to rehab when she got out I sent her about 500 for rehab supplies. She was kicked out within a week or 2 for fighting with another rehab patient. Her mother was pissed and did not allow her to return home, she asked me help her again. I sent her about 500 dollars again and sent her abut 300 to get her a hotel room a couple days until she got into a 2nd time.

This time it was a fit she stayed in that rehab for a whole month, her mother told me she had never in her life been in rehab that long. We talked on the phone a couple times a week when she would have phone time, we would reminisce about kind of being room mates sharing hotel rooms and some point in the conversation she said she wanted, that took me by surprise I always did love her she knew that but I never thought anything would come of it, but here we were. After she finished her month of rehab she went back to live with her mom and step dad on their farm. I flew up to visit her and got to meet her parents and everything visited her for a week. I was happy everything was going well, I wanted her to move back down with me after I saved up enough money for a place, but she wanted custody of eldest daughter beforehand so we had to keep it long distance.  

Shortly after she had a relapse. After finding out her mother gave her an ultimatum of go to rehab for another month or be kicked out, she refused to do another month of rehab and was kicked out. This led to me sending her money for hotel rooms again and her going back to escorting ways. She begged me to send her money for a car, said if she had a car and a little bit of money she could hold down a job (she used to be a stripper) and move in somewhere to pay rent. Eventually I took a loan out to send her money to get the car so she could atleast be mobile, she eventually moved in with a room mate she found on craigslist and moved in to his place this past July. This guy was an asshole who seemed normal but the what he said to her in private was psycho I'd rather not to discuss him, but she ended up buying a faulty car and didn't even have a mechanic look at it beforehand so she coudn't refund it and as she got deeper into her addiction she didn't keep up with it or try to get it fixed.

At some point she told me of the problems she had with this room mate and how far into her addiction she was she wanted to go back to rehab, I was happy and gladly sent her money but she didn't go to rehab she would always be going ""sunday"" but when sunday came she would never go. I wanted to wait until she went to rehab before I would visit her but at some point I realized I had no idea when she would actually go to rehab.  

I came to visit her again this past late november/early december and saw what the situation was with this room mate. After I spent another week with her catching up and discussing what she wanted to do. When I got back home I took out a 2k loan and sent her the money to pay first month/security deposit for a legitimate roommate. She promised with her customers she'd be able to afford rent from here on out. She wasn't able to pay rent next month and went back to hotel hopping. We even went through the whole going to rehab on ""sunday"" event again as well.  

At some point she met a friend Meaghan, meaghan was a lot like me and she would try tot ake care of her and stay with her in her hotel rooms like I used to when she lived in my state. I had always wanted her to just up and come back down to florida with me, she had recent run ins with the law and she wanted to continue out all her court dates as she still wanted a chance to get custody of her kid.  

This past thursday she was wheezing, she woke meaghan and aked her for help as she was gasping, she turned blue and collapsed. Me and meaghan thought it was an asthma attack at the time cause she always did have breathing issues and got pneumonia sometimes. It took the EMTs 10 minutes to get there and 5 minutes to get a pulse. I was so fucking scared, but they got a pulse I hoped she'd pull through and this was gonna be her rock bottom moment. Me and meaghan talked about how we'd try to get her into rehab after she recovers from this. The doctors placed her in an induced coma and cooled her body down to allow her brain and body to heal. The next day they lowered the sedation and checked her responses. She had no response to anything they tried pupils you name. She passed midnight on saturday. She was 31 years old.

I had never been as close to anyone as I was to this woman and I've only known her for about a year and 2 months, we'd have been officially together through all this a year in May. When I was there in november/december we had a heart to heart she told me I had been her ride or die for a while now always there for her moreso than her own family she felt and one of the only people she had been true to. She would always tell me I deserved better than some junkie and she was sorry she couldn't be the woman I deserved. She was my dream girl. I always imagined a future we'd have together. She would eventually go to rehab she has done it before so she'll do it again I thought. Once she comes out of this rock bottom hospital visit she'll be set straight.  

I had never been close to an addict before and god is it hard when its someone you come to love like this. The worst thing is thinking about how young she died she was 31. She could have lived to 60 70 hell maybe 80 who knows but she had a lot more time left on this earth and could have made a lot more memories. Her mom is going to have her cremated and she'll send me some of her ashes next week when she comes in.  

This woman became the light of my life. Everything I did was in the future I'd have with her in saving my money, making my decisions etc. The light of my life and gone just like that. If I had to spend everyday of my life taking care of her, cooking for her, cleaning for her you name it I would be happy and fulfilled in this life i'd be like that sterotypical 1950's housewife except as a guy. All I'll have to show for it is a jar of her ashes."
119,1,"I don't know how many people have read Steve-O's book or watched any of his YouTube videos or interviews... But he really is an awesome role model for people in recovery. He was addicted to coke, alcohol and so much more.

He also has a very interesting idea of the spiritual realm in relation to drug use if any of you are into that.

[Here's a link](https://youtu.be/QOU9ETnK9AE) of someone interviewing him about first going to rehab and then going into a sober living facility. It's really cool. Watch his other videos too if you haven't already!"
120,1,"weekends are my weakness.

I've already overdosed this year, yesterday I had someone threaten my life at a nightclub, and when I went home I nearly choked on my own puke. 

I want to use this experience as a way to finally quit. 

even when I overdosed after the hospital I ended up doing more drugs. after nearly dying.

all the money I have left after paying my bills - around $1,200 - go to drugs. sometimes I go without food for days. I'm feeling really hopeful that things are going to change since it's my birthday soon. I have hope and faith. At one point I was considering suicide simply because I wanted to escape this hell of wanting to quit, using, spending everything, humiliating myself, then getting into debts to get high - then dealing with inevitable comedowns.

Back in October my coke habit was so extreme I was going through five grams in a night. Then going to work, high and strung the fuck out. Then doing it again. 

Now it's just a weekend thing. I need it to stop.

Please, any suggestions? I think becoming a homebody might work."
121,1,It doesn‚Äôt seem like much but I left an abusive relationship and am in a sober house and am 35 days off coke today and got my 30 day chip and am very excited. It hasn‚Äôt been as scary as I thought it would be and I‚Äôm super excited for everything recovery holds. Im trying not to be too honeymoon period about this but realistic but I‚Äôm just really happy.
122,1,"so like ive been on meth for a year on and off

id take a month or two breaks sometimes

but lately ive been addicted

me mates wants me to stop

i like to hurt myself and suicidal tbh? half n half

so wtf u think i should do"
123,1,"I got sober at 17 and have stayed sober for 31 years.

I am in a Facebook group for teens that got sober called oldypaa (a play on icypaa).

There was a post from a guy who got 12 stepped by another high schooler in 1988 (thank you late 80s treatment boom).

They were both at their high school reunion, still sober...over 60 years sobriety between them.

Bright eyed, happy and enjoying life.

I have several friends in my ladies meeting that didn't really drink much until their kids went to college. Then they got bad fast.  And ended up in treatment in their 60s.  One has almost 20 years sober now.

It is never too early or too late to quit if you want to stop drinking."
124,1,Does anyone else experience this in recovery?  Does it ever go away?
125,1,"So I‚Äôm almost six months clean. 

I‚Äôve just come back from a camp get away with new friends I have made throughout my two or so years of recovery.  (Had a minor lapse few months ago thus the ‚Äúsix month‚Äù mark). Anyhow, this getaway has just highlighted to me how damn disconnected I still feel from people. In many instances I feel so disconnected that I actually feel as if I have disassociated or that I am like an alien out of this world. 

Another feeling I get is very burnt out, it‚Äôs as if my social gas tank is very small and if I go past that I am actually absolutely exhausted. I noticed I had to have a midday sleep during the camping trip almost every day while others continued doing activities and hanging out with one another because just being near so many people for such extended periods of time was actually hard hard hard work. 

I mean I have always been aware that addiction would lead to emotional and social underdevelopment but it was a really confronting and unavoidable notion this weekend. 

I also feel kind of disillusioned because I know that this feeling of being an alien amongst people, having a small social tank being so socially awkward was the reason I ever picked up back a decade ago and did not put it back down. 

Anyhow I just needed to rant to a group of people who I know might understand. 

I just wanted to say, thanks for being here guys cause I think I might very well have just floated off into the sky this weekend if it wasn‚Äôt for having a connection to this community and seeing your posts. &lt;3"
126,1,"I've accomplished a whole year clean from drugs and sober from alcohol.

Very hopeful for more years to come."
127,1,"Hi guys, thank you so much for all your posts. They‚Äôve helped me a lot and it‚Äôs been a great resource.

About me, I had four open abdominal surgeries, 12 hospital stays and basically had norco prescribed to me for a good two years. My last surgery was a hernia removal which was scar tissue from all my other operations. My doctor notes all the norco I had been prescribed and was concerned and wrote me a prescription for tramadol. Which I won‚Äôt take because I‚Äôve seen friends have seizures from it. 

So basically I got back on the norco and developed a 2 year (in addition) habit. I was taking about 100/120 mgs a day. I started to totally isolate myself and get depressed. My family, which whom I‚Äôm very close, all knew something was up. So finally I had a little meltdown and decided enough is enough. 

I went and saw a doctor who prescribed me suboxone. It‚Äôs been working great and I‚Äôm taking less than she prescribed (4 mg 3x a day) but enough to work as I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on this as well. 

I‚Äôve been down at my parents house for 10 days to chill out, took a little mental health break etc. They all know what I‚Äôm doing and are very relieved and supportive. I am very lucky.

I have some questions though as there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ‚Äúsuboxone for dummies‚Äù book yet:

1. Does suboxone make you tired? I find myself to be fatigued all day. I feel like could just sleep.

2. Does suboxone depress you? I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm depressed or just tired or both.

3. I know I have to ‚Äúre enter‚Äù society soon. Will I be able to function normally? So far I‚Äôve been cool. A little agitated at times but I‚Äôve been staying with Family for 10 days üòÇ.

4. I have no desire to take pills at all, whether it be for my pain or the euphoric pain I‚Äôd get first from 1 pill and then from 12. That wasn‚Äôt really a question but I wanted you to know I don‚Äôt feel triggered.

5. Is there a suboxone timeline I can refer to?  Can anyone share any more information I should know???

Thank you so much! Have a wonderful me!!!

134,1,"I went from being clean, working, having 10k in savings, getting ready to move house and get a better job. One day I ran into someone who had cocaine. IV Coke almost killed me a million times but had been away from it for 3 years. I did one shot. 4 weeks later all 10k was emptied and spent on coke that went in my arm. I overdosed on coke several times. I was doing .7 gram shots trying to get the biggest rush without dying that I could, constantly increasing dosage until I was in convulsions unable to hear anything or see anything. My veins are all gone. I was hospitalized 4 times in the last month, I'm getting tests because they think I induced one , if not several, 'cardiac events'. I am 27 years old and went to the gym everyday prior to this. After I emptied my savings, I robbed the drug dealer for 2k worth of cocaine, and jumped off a roof while running away. I have a possibly herniated disc in my lumbar spine, waiting on xray results, and couldn't move for about 3 days after that. I find out next week what the state of my heart and spine is.

I am 9 days clean. I even jumped off 12mg of suboxone/day cold turkey. I have never been so down and low. I tried hanging myself on day 3 and 4. I couldn't get it to work and gave up. Can't even get that right. 

I feel like I've had so many chances, but finally blown it. The physical damage to my body is making me want to give up hope. I had a shot at a healthy life without these problems and I feel like I've blown my shot at a decent life. I know I'm catastrophizing. It feels real though. I'm so mentally fucked up and just want to give up, go back out and finish the job. It feels like every other relapse I healed from, but that this one was just the worst one ever, and that I did permanent damage to myself  that I will forever regret.

I dont know. I am going to get back on the wagon. But it's hard right now. I have to do it though. I have slept 6 hours in the past week from the sub withdrawal, been going NUTS. But I will stay clean one day at a time. 

I guess I'm posting this hoping someone will say something encouraging. I feel so lost and alone right now. I burned everything in my life to the ground, and it feels like I gave up my health as well. I don't know what the future holds."
135,1,"I started getting drunk and high at 11. At first, this experimentation was born entirely of curiosity. I was enamored by the ability to alter ones consciousness and indulged in a variety of drugs (alcohol, weed, LSD, mushrooms, RC's, benzos, etc). When I was just starting high school, I read about this interesting drug called kratom and decided to order some. I tried it with a friend. It made him sick and I thought it was alright, but tasted like shit. It sat in the back of my guitar amp for a little less than a year, left untouched. One day I had some really boring work to do and decided to give it another chance. I ordered 300 grams the next day and here I am 3 years later with only brief periods of abstinence.

  Somehow I've been able to sort of hold my life together. I've maintained good grades and recently got accepted to an excellent university. The past two years I've lossed all motivation, been extremely depressed and have developed chronic insomnia. Up until a month ago I was also abusing Adderall very heavily until I hallucinated during a Calculus exam. I've used my friends, parents and teachers in ways that I deeply regret. I constantly borrow money from friends and family to feed my 30-40 gpd addiction. My teachers somehow still believe in me and allow me to hand in everything late. I rarely come to class and when I do I'm nodding out and barely functional most of the time. I used to be aspirational and disciplined. Now I stay in bed reading, watching YouTube, jerking off and vaping all day. I used to go to the gym almost everyday and now my family thinks I have anorexia.

  I'm hoping to switch to S&amp;V prior to spring break and then going cold turkey. Only close friends know about my issue and I cannot confide in family. For a long time now, I've rationalized my behavior by telling myself my friends are far worse and that I got into school, which is all that matters. I was prescribed Trazadone for insomnia today and fear another dependency.

What advice do you have for a 17 year old addict in terms of how to go about quitting?"
136,1,"Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I‚Äôm looking for some opinions/advice on the situation I‚Äôve found myself in. 

I met someone I‚Äôm madly in love with, I knew his past included hard drugs and lots of partying but was told that part was over and he wanted to get away from that. We‚Äôve had maybe 5/6 instances in the past two months where he‚Äôs fallen back into it, which would leave me not hearing from him for 10+ hours.

Not sure if I should listen to him when he says he wants to get out of it and be there to support him or just leave now(which I can‚Äôt even stand the thought of) 

Is it an addiction if it‚Äôs once every two weeks? Am I really going to leave someone I care so much about because they want to indulge in coke or prescription drugs 2 times a month? To me there is a lot of grey area, I have no experience with anything other than weed and an alcoholic father and when feelings get into the mix everything is more complicated.

Can anyone relate to this?"
138,1,"Celebrated 18 months last week... couldn't keep drugs or alcohol out of my body for even a day before I got sober. 

Life is crazy, but I am grateful every day. Thank you to AA/CA, subs like this one, the god of my understanding, and a lot of helpful people along the way.

There is a way out for you too."
139,1,"This may be more because I used for so long that I have no concept of time. I don't remember the calendar day, time of day, day of the week, anything. I can't even really remember where I was or what I did. Is this common? I kind of wish I knew just so that I could keep track of the days or know when certain ""anniversaries"" and stuff would be."
140,1,"So my addiction all started in 9th grade when I got injured and was prescribed codeine , from there it just elevated over the years with weed ,Xanax,  Percocets lsd and a bunch of other junk . I‚Äôm currently struggling with adderalls and cocaine. It‚Äôs gotten so bad all the money I had saved up over the years (to buy myself a car ) got blown on buying several scripts and an ounce of coke at a time. I‚Äôve recently OD I‚Äôm sure of it, but looked like a different medical issue to the doctors  since I was afraid to speak up. I want to change but don‚Äôt know where to start, Yesterday I decided to sleep after being up for nearly 3 days and by the time I woke up ... after almost a whole day later.  I went scrambling to find some adderall before even thinking about food or using the damn bathroom. I found out I was all out and I asked my dealers whom I somehow was delusional enough to think were my friends a for a front, and they said no.  and me being dead broke realizing i lost my real best friends, spent all my money, got kicked out of university, and recently lost my job I cried in disgust. I used to weigh nearly 200 pounds with decent muscle mass, but now I‚Äôm a damn stick nearly 115. I want to do this without going to a program for I don‚Äôt want people to find out let alone my family, where do I start?"
141,1,"For over 10 years I've been abusing tramadol and every benzo out there from Valium to Xanax to klonopins. Don't tell me tramadol is not addictive or hard to get off. It's harder than oxy or vics cause they also hit the ssri anti depressant receptors.

So there it is. I'm addicted to both. 10 years got me through many hard times. Deaths of family. Energy to work hard and create a nice net worth where I can retire at 48. House paid off. Own 5 paid off rental property in Bay area too. Living in high cost area bay area California.

So how do u get off not one but two substances that each alone are a nightmare.

Can't stop everything. Gotta taper. But what. One first then the other or both at same time.

If I do this wrong I'll end up suicidal. I'm pretty sure I'm at that point now.

I do not want to do this. They stop working. We all know that.

I would say my only drug problem is thst I can't get enough drugs.

Any thoughts to become a normal citizen.

If there was a big red button I could push to wipe me from existence I would lunge at it in a heartbeat.

Does anyone have and words of wisdom to someone that made a big mistake in life.

Oh on a side note. No one knows. Only me.
People think I'm just a sharp guy. Pathetic.

Hit me....."
142,1,"Hey all,

I have been clean for 201 days. Lately, I've been thinking more and more about ""experimenting"" again with it when I do go out and drink with my friends from work. Just the other night I met a good friend of mine at a bar and some of our mutual friends made a comment ""we're gonna do a line, be right back."" I had the urge to go with them, but held my ground. 

I fucking miss it. The rush, the euphoria, the incessant jaw-clinching, and above all else, the focus I felt. I feel like I now have much more control over my life than I ever had before, so why not do a little here and there like I used to? 

I know damn well that's the addiction, and I know I would have never gotten as far as I have in school this past semester if I kept using the way I was. I suppose this is a point of where I am struggling now, especially since I am on spring break at my uni and have more free time on my hands. 

Thanks for reading, 

Dongs out. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
143,1,"I‚Äôve been clean since between October and November (I don‚Äôt have a clear date.) I constantly used pain killers and basically opioids from my parents who had surgery‚Äôs throughout the years, I drank and smoked cigarettes as well. I became clean to better myself and to live a happy life with my girlfriend. 

The main downside is I‚Äôm currently trying to find a good paying job since I‚Äôm graduating high school in two weeks. My parents though are very emotionally abusive and exhausting, my mother doesn‚Äôt really believe I can do anything or be loved by my girlfriend and always puts me in my sisters shadow. My father wasn‚Äôt there in my life as a kid till maybe age 14 due to him being a alcoholic who was also abusive and now is trying to form some sort of bond with me which I can‚Äôt really form.

I‚Äôm very stressed and severely depressed and angry at my parents and I‚Äôm struggling to keep clean especially if I get this job tomorrow. Any advice?"
144,1,"Hey everyone!

I struggle with excessive drug use since about 4 years now. I started smoking weed and tobacco at the age of 13 and since then never really stopped. A year later i started to drink and getting fucked up became part of me. I am usually pretty quiet, but when i am drunk or high i can speak more openly and freely with people. It helped me being social and getting out of my shell. Also it made me forget about the week and my problems. On every occasion i drank and smoke until I got into a total state of numbness and the world around me became a blur.

This was all not so bad. I still went to school and got good grades, had some hobbies and friends outside of the party group. Until i discovered raves and techno music at the age of 18. After my first pill i completely succumbed into the world of electronic music. I quickly started to use all kinds of drugs on the weekends and I lost all friends outside of the scene. I did not realized what changed me because i always told myself i like the music, the people, the raves, i am a party person this is who i am. But recently i started to question this mindset

Now 4 years later i am 22 and its still going as it started, but i kind of start to question everything. If i could archive more if i stopped partying. If i am depended on the drugs even though i mainly use on the weekends. (Mainly because the occasional line to get out of bed on monday or benzodiazepines for stress relieve i do sometimes take on weekdays)

Do any of you have experience with this and could tell me their stories? I just need to know if this is ""enough"" for me to stop and get sober. Some people and escpecially my mother does not take this serious.  I just kind of feel like it's not that big of a deal because i did not hit rock bottom like other people did. I always stayed on top of my degree and work even though i felt miserable all of the time.  I hope this sounds not dumb. Would appreciate some opinions on this!

145,1,"Hey guys, posting on a throwaway for this one. 

I am very grateful and blessed to be 4 months free of drugs and alcohol. Recovery has been the most incredible experience of my life. I work a 12-step program and it has been incredibly healing and, although difficult at times, has freed me of the desire to use and given me the spirituality I‚Äôve lacked my entire life. When it comes to recovery and dealing with problems in recovery, I have all these different tools now that have taken me where I need to go. When it comes to those around me that are in recovery and struggling, I can share what has worked for me. But something I have been doing a lot of prayer on that is still scary and unfamiliar for me is being properly supportive of my severely depressed girlfriend.

We have been together for over 2 years. We met at school, and went long-distance about a year ago when she transferred schools and I dropped out and had to move home due to my addiction. The distance has been hard, and I‚Äôm not sure where the end is in sight, but I have made peace with it and am hopeful that we will be put where we need to be when we need to be there. She was supportive of me throughout my addiction, and I have historically NOT showed up as the partner she deserves. I don‚Äôt have to do that anymore. Now that I am free I can be supportive, but I don‚Äôt know how.

I am listening when she needs to talk, and reassuring her when she is having negative thoughts. But she isn‚Äôt going to class, she‚Äôs eating less, and I see her spiraling into her depression more and more. If she continues not going to class, she‚Äôs probably going to fail out. If she continues not eating, it‚Äôs going to threaten her life. Above all that, she‚Äôs positively miserable and hopeless right now and it‚Äôs breaking my heart. I feel so useless in this. I know I need to discern what I can actually control and what I can‚Äôt but I don‚Äôt know where that line is in this situation. 

I felt like she does now once upon a time, and so I know it‚Äôs possible to come out of that. These days I know a happiness and peace like never before, even when battling issues like this. I know there has to be hope for her if there was hope for me and I want to help her get there but most of the time I don‚Äôt know what to say when she‚Äôs talking to me about how terrible she feels, and I don‚Äôt know what to suggest. In a weird way, it would be easier if her issue was addiction; I have suggestions for that and I have my experience to draw on. But even though I was once depressed like she was, I was lucky enough to be an addict and to be brought to a 12-step program that has worked for me. I don‚Äôt know what would work for her.

She‚Äôs in therapy and seems to leave every appointment more upset, and she‚Äôs taking an antidepressant that doesn‚Äôt seem to help much. What is out there for someone that‚Äôs depressed like this? I know she needs help and I want so badly to provide it or guide her to it but I don‚Äôt know how.

She is so wonderful and I love her so much. She supported me through my addiction and I want to support her now. I am praying and begging for the answers but I have no clue what the fuck to do. This is the most powerless I‚Äôve felt since I‚Äôve come into recovery.

Does anybody have any suggestions?"

Today I lament the dead. Those who I could not save, and those who could not save themselves. All of them were gone too soon. It breaks my heart and I think of them all each and every day.

147,1,"Hey guys. I originally took this AD (15mg) for anxiety back last March and was on it until November of last year. It‚Äôs been 4 months since my last dose. I think ever since my first dose I was incredibly sensitive to it and I had pharyngitis and a really bad jaw ache when I started. My doctor wanted me to switch to lexapro (10mg), but I reacted badly and probably had slight serotonin syndrome. I decided to stay on remeron as I didn‚Äôt have a really insane reaction like profusely sweating and heightened vision. As I‚Äôve been taking remeron I eventually reached some sort of psychosis, and I‚Äôm pretty sure my immune system became suppressed. My thoughts became odd and things seemed out of place. I tapered off, and the past four months I‚Äôve had intrusive thoughts, fatigue, eye fatigue, anxiety, psychosis, itching, and others. Progressively it got better, but last friday was when it snapped. The intrusive thoughts and fatigue literally snapped and disappeared, but some side effects got stronger. Currently my emotions are literally everywhere, low ass libido, I just feel like doing nothing lol, I feel like crying for no reason occasionally, and lost some interest in things. I became a zombie. Also weirdly enough, a lot of my scrapes/infections started healing REALLY fast, compared to when I was on/tapering medication. I would say I feel better than where I was 5 months ago, but there are still some lingering issues. To anyone reading this I hope you can give me some insight, because I have no idea wth is going on lol please give me some insight"
149,1,"Hey all. I've been struggling with various addictions, on and off, for the past five or six years. Alcohol, stimulants, porn, dating, social media are a few that I tend to get buried in. Six months ago I left who I consider to be the love of my life to pursue my addictions. I realized my mistake and am now trying to make things work with her. I've been sober from alcohol, porn, and social media for six weeks. Right now I feel very empowered and am in a really good place, but I recognize that this may not last forever so I'm proactively working through the 12 steps according to Recovery by Russell Brand. I'm on Step 4 and starting to look for a trustworthy person or group to complete Step 5. But my problem is what Russell in the book calls ""amorphous"". I'm not specifically an alcoholic, junkie, sex addict, etc. but rather just have a pattern of addictive and pleasure-seeking behavior. So it doesn't seem like something like AA is a good fit for me. Does anyone have a recommendation of where I could plug into a group for this more general, addictive personality type?"
150,1,"I've been through this so many times it's a joke I'm near 40 days clean and my brain is telling me non stop that I can pickup some oxy or a bag of weed that no one is going to know.

Honestly fucking NA is my biggest driving force I don't want to have to face relapsing in front of them and couldn't just lie if I was using again. 

Realistically I know I must fight these urges because it's never a simple relapse for me it always ends in hell. My brain is so powerful though telling me I can enjoy a night off that I've earned a check out from reality because I've done so well. 

Drugs are so accessible and my sobriety is so important to me. I guess I know all the things to say my brain is such a cheeky fucker I really needed to vent somewhere about these cravings I can't make a meeting till mid week."

155,1,"I‚Äôve struggled with addiction since I was 14 and had my first drink and cigarette. At 16 I had my first joint and then it went downhill from there. It‚Äôs mostly been weed and alcohol but I‚Äôve had moments with nitrous, coke, H, and too many hallucinogens to count. My lungs have collapsed, my mental health is down the tubes, and I‚Äôve lost so many friends to addiction. I withdrew from my second semester at college to get clean on my own (I was gonna hike the appalachian trail). As was predictable, that didn‚Äôt work and I kept using. One day I was deep into an alcohol bender and I thought ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die like this‚Äù. I called a hotline and they connected me with this establishment in California. I‚Äôm about to get on a plane there now. I want out of addiction, I want to be free, and I‚Äôm willing to work to get there. It‚Äôs literally life or death. Wish me luck."
156,1,"So usually I work during the day. I work at a science museum and most of my interactions are with toddlers thru middle school kids. I love my job - usually. Tonight they needed me to work an after hours event. I tried to wiggle my way out of it but ultimately ended up doing it... I‚Äôm new and I want them to think I‚Äôm dependable. 

Well, honestly, that sucked the life out of me. Everyone was drunk. I mean, I used to be a bartender so I‚Äôve seen it all, but I got away from it all for a reason. It was just one never ending panic attack and I feel physically ill. I had guys hitting on me again, people doing absolutely dumb shit and not listening... people offering alcohol... like no man, one I‚Äôm on the clock, two I‚Äôm trying to stay sober. Everyone was so fake and plastic. No, the world of alcohol hasn‚Äôt changed a bit. 

But I have. 

I survived. It was rough. I‚Äôm going to request to my boss that I never do that again, even if it means telling him about my sobriety. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be cool about it. I can‚Äôt do that again. I don‚Äôt really mind being around family and friends drinking because I can always excuse myself if I want to, but when you‚Äôre on the clock you can‚Äôt simply just leave. 

I‚Äôm going to go home, make some tea and cuddle with my puppy."
157,1,it‚Äôs just hard. everyone around me thinks that i faked my addiction for attention. i don‚Äôt even know why. i don‚Äôt like talking about it and while i struggled with it i kept it a secret. yet everyone around me dismisses me and tells me to stop lying. it‚Äôs so hard to stay sober when you don‚Äôt have any sort of support group.

First off, I apologize that this post is not what this community was meant for.  This seems like a very positive and constructive space, and I in no way want to adulterate that.

I am currently writing a film that circles around addiction and recovery, and I have a question about the rehab process.  I have read that there is usually an intake interview, but I was wondering if there is any kind of outgoing interview for when a patient is checking out.  If so, what kind of questions are asked?  

Adding an outgoing interview scene would benefit my script, but I don't want to include anything that wouldn't actually happen. 

Thank you so much!"
160,1,Hello üëã I first started smoking weed for 6 years and it got to the points here I was smoking several times a day to function.  I have been sober from marijuana for 10 days today. Last night I had a dream that I smoked then immediately regretted it and rushed downstairs to brush my teeth while crying in shame. I woke up this morning to relief that it was only just a dream but I also can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I‚Äôm curious as to if anyone else has had similar experiences?
161,1,"Hello everyone, I'm posting again after my last few about how horrible I was feeling. I finally did it, seems like the impossible. So I bought my last three fentanyl pills (blue m box 30's). I have been addicted to opiates for 6 years but was never truly hooked till I found these things last year. I would have random binges that lasted a few months at a time, then I would detox and it wouldnt be that bad. Just minor aches and a little bit of lingering depression for a few days. I thought just like all of us addicts think, ""I cant control it"". Well I happen to come across the blues and did my regular binge, work, and video games. Time went on and BOOM, it's been 7 months  and I haven't gotten off these things. So I got 5 days off work and decide to detox. I thought this is gunna be bad, but not that bad. Man I was son wrong... I made it three days and by 65 hours in I was laying on my bathroom floor with a blanket feeling like I was on fire. I tried everything in my will to keep going but their was something different about this shit. It got so bad that I was telling myself every possible excuse for me to get up and go get high. It was even one of those times where positice we cant get anything because we owe our dealer too much or dont have any cash. But somehow I managed to manipulate my dealer into fronting me. As soon as they told me to come threw it's like I was already feeling better. Seriously though I couldn't even barely walk down my stairs, make food, or even take a shower. But as soon as my mind knew I was about to get it I felt 10x better. So obviously I fucking relapsed... unfortunately. So I kept it going for another couple months but the whole time I was calling rehab centers and seeing a doctor for help. Come to find out my insurance has a strict policy towards addiction help. At this point I was feeling hopeless. I called everywhere, I even went and took a ton of blood for my doctor just to find out that he cant prescribe addiction medication. I literally felt like I was in a 10 foot hole with no latter. I'm waking up every day at this point and crying in the mirror because I'm so tired and scared. I just feel as if theirs no exit and I'm getting farther from it if their is. One day I get off work and I'm watching this YouTube video about this guy who is an alumni. He talks about how he felt getting of heroin and its described the exact way I felt. In the bio was some Americas addiction treatment program or something in those lines. So I called the number that was under it and talked to a lady who wanted my zip code and things like that. I'm talking on the phone and my girlfriend wakes up and yells ""I'm trying to sleep can you please just do this tomarrow"". At the time I felt upset like she didnt care if I got help or not. Now I know after being sober for a few months that she was just honestly tired and had work in the morning. But that's what I'm saying this drug made me even get upset about the craziest things. Anyways I ended up hanging the phone up and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and the number had texted me 4 different facilitys to call. I called the one closest to me; Rancho Milagro Recorey Center. This place talked to me for two day threw text and call. They were so kind and understanding. These people genuinely cared about helping others. She checked my insurance and realised that they couldn't take it. They decided to do a private pay plan with me where we decided $3500 as the full payment. They lite saved me. Not one place that I called would take anything near that, at that point they would be hanging up on me.  These people told me to come in as soon as I could. I left that day and headed up into the mountains of Temecula California. Their place was a nice house that was turned into a treatment facility on a ranch. They had horses, goats, cows, pigs, even an emoo. Even though none of that was really me, it was still really nice to get away and be out of this drug filled town. During my stay they put me on a suboxone taper. They started me at 16mg and slowly tapered me down to 1mg which lasted 8 days. The whole time I was on suboxone I barely felt any withdrawal which scared me. I didnt know if I was going still like shit or not. Thankfully afterwards I only had bad sweating and felt depressed for the next couple weeks. Dont get me wrong, that shit sucked but wasn't as bad as cold turkey withdrawals.  The best part was that every worker there was a recovering addict with at least 2 years under their belt. I dont think people really understand that it's so much better this way. Being able to get help from people that have been there helped me so much. Getting to hear their story's and see them smile and go on their day without getting high was very inspirational. I got close with all the nurses, the clients and even the cook. These people literally saved my life and I could never thank them more. Anyways it was group, group, group, group, meeting. The first half I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand getting up at 7 and doing group all the way till 6pm and then a meeting. Near the second half I started to really understand the reasoning behind that. My counselor told me one thing that really stuck, and it was that theirs one thing we have to change and that's everything. This shit is no joke guys. If your reading this and aren't full on addicted yet, please stop. This was the worst year of my life, everything that happened has permanently scarred me. Dont forget that it also takes 2 years to fully recover if you can. Having a substance control you and take over your thoughts is insane. Addiction is honestly the definition of insane. We have a disease that tells us we dont have one. Their is so much more in life after you get to the other side and see. I truly hope that someone reads this and gets help. It's possible and I know your thinking it's not because I did... it's truly glorious. Thank you."

163,1,"Hello all,

So as of right now, I've been sober for a little over a year. Without going to indepth, I'll just say that I had a very heavy, quickly lived addiction to Xanax that lasted for about 3-4 months in total. I got help at a rehabilitation facility last February, and have been sober since.

However, the issue I'm facing now is that I can't seem to get back into the things I used to do that made me happy.

For example, I've been programming since I was 11 years old (22 now) and I'm nearly finished with my degree in computer science. I've taken a break from college for the last year, but I'm wanting to get back into programming so that when I go back, I'm ready. I used to program for fun and even made \~$20k off of some stuff I made in the past. However, ever since I went into rehabilitation, I can't bring myself to get back into it. I sit at the computer with literally 0 motivation to do anything programming related.

I know it's normal to maybe not enjoy things you used to do while messed up once you're sober, but this is something I've been doing for 11 years now, 95% of which were sober.

What should I do? Any advice is greatly appreciated, I'm having a hard time with this."

168,1,"Hey. 

I'm 20M and am addicted to heroin and crack. It started with pain pills when i was 16, progressed to snorting heroin, then injecting. I wanted to quit, and lived with my dad in south africa since October. I didnt use while I was there, and have been back home in UK for a week. I was doing well, able to be alone at home and walk round the city without scoring, but tonight I messed up. 

I was on a tinder date, it went well but she didnt want me coming to hers (which was calm!) but this was the first time I was tipsy in the city. As soon as she left, really heavy cravings kicked in and I looked around for homeless people to score off. I couldnt find any, and I came to my senses and thought 'no dont fuck up, get some maccies and bus home.' As I left maccies, a homeless guy asked me for 90p. Boom. I went back to my old ways, asked if he could score, and bought some crack. I'm now coming down from it and am just pissed off at myself. On the one hand, I bought as little as possible, didnt buy heroin and came straight home. On the other, I bought drugs again and am worried that the next time I drink in the city I'm just going to go score again. 

I'm mainly writing this to vent as I know tomorrow I'll need to call dad and tell him whats happened (hes an ex crack addict and he'll understand without attacking.) I'm now wondering if I should give up alcohol aswell and be completely sober. I dont know...

They're such amazing people and they don't pressure me into picking up on purpose but it ends up going that way all the time.

Worse yet I've been one foot in one foot out fir a long time and a lot of my friends are the same way. We'll both have a couple weeks or a couple months and we get together and somebody jokes about picking up and then it's not a joke anymore. Last time my homie joked about smoking some crack so we picked up a 20, next thing you know I'm kicked out of my SLE and I pick up crystal (my DOC) on the way over.

A good half the time I'm either the one who starts the joke or makes it happen or both and I respect people who've cut me off for that reason even though it hurts. But I've also had so many people reach out and help when I'm unsure of my recovery that it's really hard to tell people I can't hang out because they're not serious enough or I don't want to talk on the phone until they're at least trying to get clean without feeling like I'm betraying them and by proxy myself when I'm in that position.

 I'm starting to understand the importance of the ""stay in the middle of the herd"" concept. I tell myself I'm going to set boundaries next time someone hits me up but they're just such fucking decent people even when they're using that the words don't come out of my mouth. I'm sure sometimes it's about subconsciously keeping the option open but sometimes it's just about wanting to stay close with people I love no matter what. Being a good friend to people who have supported me is really, really important to me and I just don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice that trait in favor of my own safety and well-being. And yet I know where it leads, and unlike some of my friends I'm not always capable of being a good friend when I'm getting high...

Ugh. Rant. Advice is welcome although to be honest I'm probably going to argue with you."
175,1,"I am going on 8 years clean and I feel ready to throw it all away because of this heart break. I‚Äôm a 26 year old woman who just got dumped out of the blue by a 30 year old woman. She said it had nothing to do with me, and that she just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt feeling it anymore‚Äù. This came out of nowhere as we had literally just been talking about our future together. We were about to buy one plane tickets to Europe, we were planning on buying a house, ect. People close to both of us have reached out to say that they‚Äôre equally as confused as I am by this because it came from nowhere.

So now my life is in a state of disarray. There were no warning signed and now I have to rewrite my future without her in it. I‚Äôve been through break ups before, but honestly never felt that anyone loved me like she did. For the first time in my life, I felt loved. 

And now all I want to do is throw away my clean time and use because I can‚Äôt stop crying, I can‚Äôt do anything, and all I can do is feel this horrible pain in my chest all day every day. I would kill to numb this pain.

I work at a treatment facility so my job entirely depends on my clean time. I am in school (finals week too) and I was doing really well up until this point. And now I want to relapse because what‚Äôs the ducking point anymore? I‚Äôve never felt this level of pain before. I just want it all to go away."
176,1,I'm 5 foot 11 and I only weigh 127.  I've been off heroin and meth for 2 years but am on methadone I've been a cigarette smoker for about 13 years and quit last month maybe I'm just impatient but I really need to gain weight and I've been told by a lot of people and doctors that I will most definitely gained some weight does anybody know how long and maybe on average how much weight I might gain... particularly any experiences from naturally tall and skinny people like myself with Fast Metabolism would help
177,1,"I found an entire bottle of norco yesterday. I thought about it. Then I turned around and went on a run. I‚Äôve been hardcore addicted to opiates for the past year of my life. It happened so fast, before I knew it I was taking oxy multiple times a day to the point where I was acting so erratically I genuinely could not see that the addiction was causing the horrible mood swings, depression, and anxiety when coming off of it. I‚Äôm 20 now, and not a single person really knows how bad it was. It‚Äôs been two weeks. And I was able to refuse yesterday. I‚Äôm slowly forgetting the feeling which is awesome, let‚Äôs hope it sticks. I‚Äôm fucking proud of myself, even if I can only tell internet strangers lol. Here‚Äôs to recovery!!! It‚Äôs worth it."
178,1,"Basically I‚Äôm at the end of my rope.

Someone, please just DM me and tell me there‚Äôs some way to end all of this without dying in a gutter. That‚Äôs what I need right now. Someone who knows and can relate. Lie to me, tell me it gets better. Tell me it gets worse, tell me there is no hope and I should just shoot myself. Just SOMEONE please remind me I‚Äôm not the only one."
179,1,"I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my current gf for about a year now. When we started hanging out all we really did was get fucked up (mainly drinking) and I ended up overdosing on heroin (recovering addict) which violated my probation and went to jail for 4 months and was released into an intense 18 month drug court program which I‚Äôve been in for almost 4 months now.

They drug test 3-4 times a week and I go to iop classes 3 days a week and even outside of that they run my life. She made the decision to stick around and support me but lately she‚Äôs been breaking promises she makes with me to spend time and instead goes out and gets fucked up with her friends. I love her to death but this shit is weighing on me I don‚Äôt know what to do I need suggestions please"
181,1,"Really need some advice. I've been so effing sexually frustrated/disappointed  in my marriage that it's been unbearable and just so sad. Could use some practical advice. Also I appreciate spiritual advice and love the 12 steps. 

I'm wondering if I've been switching addictions. 
Does anyone have experience with sexual addiction? 

 I've been clean off hard drugs for 12 years. Picked up a bad masturbation habit for 2 of those years on meth n addy. Got clean, Did no fap for 4 years. Got married. The sex was pretty awesome at first because we really love each other and were so excited to be doing life together. 

Once we had kids we were so tired our sex turned into quickies all the time. I'm pretty sure she has a hormone deficiency. She wont really see the doctor I have to do everything. 

Now I totally regret having quickies. And I fuxking hate our sex life. Everything rests on me. She just lies there. She claims she really likes sex and she moans pretty hard and ever once in a while squirts and says she really enjoys it. But . I've begged her to just do anything sexual. Give me a dance, put on a skirt. Do some foreplay. Honestly any God dam thing she would do I would be totally happy with.

 I would like it way more  often
 But honestly if it was really good I might not need it that much. 
. I want to see her face. I want to see her being attracted to me. I want to see her aroused and try to arouse me. How it was earlier. This is disappointing as fuck. I can't even hardly sleep in the same room with her because it's just fucking sad.

What have I done to help: Say alot of nice things, sweet notes, take her on dates, watch the kids, fix/clean the house, give her alot of space..I could do more but I'm fucking exhausted from it. It doesnt get anywhere. But I am happy to make her happy and she is getting stronger and happier I think. Also I used to come on to her and romance her and touch her alot. Now it just makes me sad so one sided so I backed off. 

So I love my wife and want to serve her and be there for her as best I can. I think she has hormone deficiencies. I could be more vocal about this but I feel like I've already said too much and Im worn out from trying. 

Weve been married 7 years  and kids for 5. That was rough but massive joy. We're just grinding it out in expensive California pretty broke and working alot and raising our kids. So I want to be nice because she's delt with alot of shame and insecurities. 

I think the problem is when I'm stressed I want to have more sex. I see it as a pleasant distraction . Especially if I'm trying not to drink. But she wouldn't care if we had sex a few times a year."
182,1,"Just to clarify, I‚Äôll be getting the shot on Wednesday and I last used thursday. The nurse that did the intake said 7 days but I was dumb and used. Can I still get the shot or should I reschedule?

I used fentanyl and I dont have much of a tolerance because I was clean for 13 months and then relapsed and used like 6 times before deciding I need to get back on vivitrol before it gets out of hand. I‚Äôm thinking about rescheduling the apointment but am also worried that I‚Äôll start using again if I push it off more."

184,1,I'm in recovery and looking for a gym or exercise partner or buddy. Anybody know of any groups (virtual or IRL) or apps or other resources to finding an IRL gym partner or buddy?
185,1,"I know that Vyvanse and Adderall addictions are seen as more minor, at least compared to things like meth, but this drug (Vyvanse especially) completely destroyed my life and stole months of it away on multiple occasions.

My addiction started when I was fed ADHD meds at 13 or 14. I realized within a month or two that I definitely didn‚Äôt need this shit as I was getting EXTREMELY high off them even when taken as prescribed. But I was depressed, lazy, and unconfident, and whenever I took this thing I felt incredibly
happy, stimulated, functional, and social. I could not get enough of it from the beginning. 
I learned later that I took a particular liking to dextro. I think I honestly preferred the long lasting high I get off Vyvanse (basically Dextroamphetamine XR) to just about any other forms of amphetamine I‚Äôve tried. And so I had found my ultimate vice, what is, to this day, my DOC. 

It started pretty innocent. I needed to take it every day to get through the day and to get through school, I loved the high and not long after starting I felt like I needed the high or I would get very depressed. After a while it basically just felt like it had fried my brain and I needed it to function even at a fractional level to how I did before. This was the beginning of my downward spiral.

For ~ 8 months I continued this, living through a shitty brain foggy buzz that made me unmotivated to do anything. Forgetting that without this shit I was extremely depressed and dysfunctional. I barely have any memories from this time, only that it was one of the most miserable and addicted of my life. Then I met my ex girlfriend, and quit completely cold turkey. It sucked ASS. But i was also feeling pretty good in general as I was in my first real relationship, and was supported through detox and recovery by her. So it wasn‚Äôt nearly as hard as it should‚Äôve been. 

A few months later I relapsed. This period of addiction was MUCH worse. My grades plummeted, I completely stopped speaking to all of my friends and family, and developed a serious porn addiction alongside my amphetamine addiction. This time I was taking up to 300mg a day sometimes, having all night porn binges, snorting Dexedrine, Ritalin, Adderall, anything I could get my hands on. 
I wouldn‚Äôt sleep for days occasionally, I lost tons of weight, I looked sunken and pale, and I felt like I was dying. One of my most vivid and terrible memories was waking up one morning (max 2 hrs of sleep) after a 3 day weekend that I hadn‚Äôt slept at all and gone through about a gram of Vyvanse. Immediately after waking up I dizzily and sickly stumbled into my pitch black bathroom, threw up, and as I tried to stand up I got an extreme pain in my side. My lower right abdomen (my liver, presumably) hurt for days after that, and I had to awkwardly stumble through my life for a week or so. The most pathetic and disturbing memory I have though is of desperately scraping my bathroom floor looking for pieces of crushed Ritalin at 4:30AM on a Monday night one night. Not my proudest moment. 

And then, 12 days ago, I completely ran out of my 3 month prescription less than a week after receiving it. I detoxed, which was without a doubt the most miserable and painful experience of my life. I didn‚Äôt intend to quit, but after the fog had cleared, I saw what I had become. The memories started flooding back. 
And so I swore off the substance forever. Since I have started therapy, told my mom about everything, and started trying to work on my life. I felt great for a few days, but my pink cloud has faded. Today and yesterday my depression has slowly crept up on me... and though I have desperately and manically tried to distract myself... I have run out of distractions. Now I am just a depressed completely alone 16 year old about to go through PAWS with nothing to distract me from how terrible I feel... and also today is the last day before a 7 day vacation that I am dreading so much. What the hell do I do now??? I would definitely be using right now if I had the option and I hate myself for that thought."
186,1,"Hey, so today marks my first day of sobriety after relapsing from 4 months of being sober. I just wanted to post here to say hi and that I‚Äôm only new to posting to reddit and I really think this community can help me a lot. I used to be addicted to many different drugs for 3 years and I just turned 19 and realized I needed a change after having a relapse that lasted a week."
187,1,https://youtu.be/QwzWU6i-Zl0
188,1,"I‚Äôm 19 and got no one to talk to abt this yet i‚Äôm trying to heal on my own, been researching on many other pages trying to find answers to what i am experiencing right now but nothing seems to convince me that i‚Äôm okay and this would pass with time.. 

Been smoking marijuana on and off but recently heavily and daily (8joints min) for about three months  and had two bad acid trips during this time as well 

I don‚Äôt know how much i took but i‚Äôm sure it was fucking a lot i was tripping tripping, at a point where i would see letters forming on a wall and sort of smoke coming out of my eyes i enjoyed it in a way but the problem was that the trip was in a small condo so i‚Äôll let you guys imagine the scenario, we finished by going out for some fresh air but i lost touch with reality and time..

Not gonna lie but i wasn‚Äôt prepared mentally and never new how hard it would hit, plus the people i was with when i took it made the trip worse.

Fast forward, 46 days that i‚Äôm sober quit cold turkey everything except cigarettes which i reduced massively.

Been experiencing some fucking weird shit from day 25:

-tingling in my ears
-panic attacks in the morning feeling like i am fucked for life which was my main fear during the trip
-insomnia (5hrs a sleep a night only) even after exercise 
-I would wake up always at the same time 8:30 am even 
-can‚Äôt concentrate or find words for things
-can‚Äôt keep a fluid conversation going
-over analyzing stuff (anxiety)
-self aware too much
-Hard depression 
-looping thoughts 
- no feeling of pleasure at all

What i realized is they are less severe than on day 25 but they‚Äôre still there, i also read on the internet that acid can fuck you up for life is it actually possible? and for people who have been on the same boat how long did it take to feel normal again ?"
189,1,"Emotions are oscillating between elation, excitement, nervousness, anxiety/impending doom, relaxation, tiredness, guilt, pride, essentially im a fucking mess. I meditated maybe 30 minutes a day every single day past two weeks. I feel like its made a difference but its hard to say. Coming clean off benzos and ghb, ik things will stabilize eventually but I‚Äôm on rapidfire and its kinda unsettling. How was your experience coming off sedatives? I could use a positive anecdote.  
Thanks guys."

191,1,"I've never shared online about my struggle with sobriety from this substance, but I've shared with CLOSE friends (no family, they don't know about my past drug usage at all), and have kept a count-up timer on my phone since the day I quit cold-turkey.

Previously I was spending upwards of (minimum) $250 per week on cocaine, quit cold turkey in October 2018. Just realized that today officially marks 500 days since I've used coke and really wanted a place to celebrate that...

192,1,"I posted in opiates and also wanted to post here to ask for help... I usually never post just lurking. I relapsed after being a year and some more sober... ish. Was a year on suboxone then kratom and about a month completely clean. Now I‚Äôm using oxycodone again... also probably will get wd when I stop and I‚Äôm honestly scared. Life is so difficult without opiates. 

Also I wanted to ask.

How can I stop doing cocaine? I feel like it‚Äôs so evil in a way the way it sucks me back in every day. I‚Äôve been binging since last Thursday and can‚Äôt find any will to stop.

193,1,"I've been sober completely (including alcohol) for about a month and a half but sober from narcotics for almost seven months. Before that I had spent two years of my life addicted and reliant, and four years of my life an alcoholic.

Being sober is harder than I could've ever imagined, especially noticing that my entire personality was based on drugs and alcohol. That was how I had fun. That was how I relaxed. That was how I coped with life. Now it feels like I can't do any of those things. I go to meetings, I see a therapist, but still I feel like I can't find the same happiness or positivity that I had using.

That was a lot of words to explain that I'm here seeking a way to be positive again with my newfound sobriety. Any literature you could reccomend, any subreddits, any articles, or anything that could help me become someone who can feel like they're thriving without using. I feel weak struggling to be happy without using, but I'm asking for any kind of help or advice. 

Stay strong guys. It's hard to see that it's worth it, but I promise it is."
194,1,"I had almost 2 months clean from shooting anything into my veins and a few days ago I went back to sticking a needle in my arms. I was doing certain things right, such as attending IOP 3x a week, going to the gym regularly, eating healthy, engaging in self care, forming healthy relationships, etc...but there were warning signs that I decided to ignore... I was foolishly trying to make some extra cash by selling drugs and I thought I would be okay because it wasn't my DOC. 

&amp;#x200B;

FFS, will this ever end? I let my family down once again as I came clean to them about it and now they think I'm back at square one... Am I? I feel like all the progress I've made up to this point has been lost and its an awful feeling. Just total despair. I feel directionless. I will no doubt be booted from my IOP and then I will have even less structure, but I'm not willing to go to inpatient again. I managed to use for just a few days then stop and honestly that's how I got these 45 days or whatever this time. I can do it again.

I guess what I'm really looking for is for someone to reassure me and tell me it's going to be okay."

196,1,"I had been abstinent from crystal meth for six years when I relapsed in 2018. Within a couple months, I was trying to quit. I could make it a couple days sometimes. Other times, a week or so. In nine months, unable to abstain, I told my husband. It was so hard. He had so many ideas about addiction that weren't based on medical science but rather were based on the moralism that people with substance use disorders have been dealing with since our suffering began.

I am blessed. My husband read the research I shared with him. He was skeptical but grew to be supportive. I got involved in advocating for changes in drug policy and more access to treatment. Then I relapsed again after a few months. But the advocacy was so important to me. Even high on meth, I showed up. Then someone called me a leader in the recovery movement and I knew I had to find a way to make recovery stick.

I made plans to quit again at the beginning of September, 2019. I told my husband about my new relapse and that I was going off to the woods to detox (because fuck fluorescent lighting). I came back and my final year of school began. It was so different. Being off meth, I could show up 100% for my classes and my clients. Every day felt like such a blessing. Still, the cravings were terrible. Some tv show I was watching suddenly had someone smoking a meth pipe and I was pulling out my phone to find where the party was at. Thank God I was too drunk to drive.

Everything changed in November. I had been out at a bar and I met someone who was talking about psychedelic mushrooms. I'd been trying really hard to do things that could heal my brain damage but I was constantly finding myself pressing up against places where I used to have capacity and I just didn't anymore. I had read that psilocybin could potentially help with neurogenesis. So I bought some and I did a mushroom trip with a dear friend. The next day, I woke up without nicotine cravings. I haven't had a craving for nicotine or used nicotine since that next day. The next time I saw someone using meth on TV, I felt nothing.

The mushrooms made it so clear. I am so happy today. Meth made me unhappy. I prefer being happy to unhappy. I have no interest in ever doing the drugs that made me unhappy ever again.

Now I try to do mushrooms once a month. It helped me quit nicotine, stopped my meth cravings, changed my relationship with food and alcohol, made me love my job and broke me out of post-acute withdrawal depression. Psilocybin may be the best thing that ever happened to me. Imagine being lost in the darkness for so long and then suddenly someone turns on the lights and the scary things aren't anymore. You can see what you're doing and where you are going. I am so blessed and there's nothing I want to do more than help others who are lost in the dark turn on the lights and find their way home."

199,1,I‚Äôm one year clean from marijuana before that I was 3 years clean but I relapsed. Just looking for any similar stories because to be real I‚Äôm embarrassed to say I was an addict especially to marijuana back when I was using I thought it was harmless but I like to think I was just a stupid kid. Now I have schizophrenia which is bullshit but shit happens.
200,1,"Hey guys, I don't post here often (I may never have posted here on this account) but I felt like I need to share this because it's bouncing around in my head. So, I'm reading the book Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace (highly recommend btw) and one of the characters describes how he is in a perpetual state of grief for his lost vice. How really, when it comes down to it, he hopes that each passing day will ease the sting associated with the loss of what, in his eyes was his one true love and friend. And yeah, that sounds kinda flowery and poetic but it did getting me thinking. 

I've never really looked at it like that but when I think about it, that's exactly how it feels. Because if I'm really honest with myself, although I'm glad and proud to be clean I desperately miss it. I can't lie to myself and pretend that it was all hell and I didn't enjoy it because I wouldn't be an addict if I didn't enjoy at least some part of it. I miss being able to turn to getting high, I miss the slightly perverse comfort in knowing that I could always just sedate myself if life was getting on top of me. And while it definitely does feel like grief, I suppose it's a unique and dangerous type of grief because the danger of undoing all my progress if the grief gets too much is all too real. You can't give your dead nan one last hug, but I could very easily phone an old friend and be high within the hour. 

Sorry for rambling a bit here but that scene really hit home with me. It was comforting, being able to put a name to that constant but sometimes distant gnawing, but it was also a punch in the gut because it made me realise I'll likely never be free even though I'm clean."
201,1,Just wanted to say this is my second day of recovery from my marijuana addiction.  I have been addicted for 45 years to marijuana and has ruined so many things for me.  Hopefully this will work this time!  Thanks for listening.
202,1,"So, when I lost my old account I knida vowed to myself that this one would be different. Although using Reddit as a place to release some of my demons is helpful it also gave people reason to think I was an asshole. 
Well, I am an asshole. 
And right now, while I sit here, high as hell I can't think of anything I wanna do more than vent this.

Why I'm an asshole. 
Here, see for yourself.

I was clean for a while, almost two years.
My ex split with me because I started using again. So I did my best to get clean and get back on track. 
I did, for about three months. But he refused me and burned almost every bridge we had. He still has my dog btw...

Then around Christmas, I slammed some ice because... I don't even remember why. 
But the cycle continued.
Clean, used, sober, high. 
Now I'm here. It's 6:30am as I write this. I've been out of it for three days. More spun than I care to think about.

My girlfriend used meth for the first time and it's my fault. 
My girlfriend. The person I'm supposed to care about and love.
I gave her death in a baggie practically. 
I feel like shit. 
I feel like killing myself. 
I want this to end but I can't end it myself. I can get help, sure. But that means moving back ""home"" to Arizona. A place that is more packed with meth than NYC for sure. 

That aside it means moving in with my aunt and her family. The kinda hard working, intelligent, middle class family that don't need a meth head mooching off of them. Living in their basement and enviably fucking up my own life and dragging theirs down too. 

I quit my job last week because I stole money from a co-worker. I replaced it but I didn't admit it was me. I couldn't bring myself to go to work the next day so I called in sick. And then the next day. Three days in total. And then I just quit.

In all my years of being a degenerate, delinquent, druggy I've never stolen. Always worked. Always been clean and well groomed. Besides letting my hair grow out. 
Right now I'm gross. I'm a mess in the worst way possible. 

Honestly I think I'm depressed, suicidal even. I'm destroying myself. Something I've always done. Now though, I'm destroying people around me. Knowingly. And just not giving a fuck. 

I don't care anymore.

Through all of this my girlfriend, a student, living in shared housing. Working on a very low part time wage. She's been the one keeping me alive and looking after me making me feel some kind of self worth.
Yet here I am telling her it's okay to try things.

Not if that thing is the exact reason I'm a mess of a human being. 

She's an adult I can't stop her but I also shouldn't encourage it. I did. I even helped her with the bowl. 

Honestly I can't even see any point in getting clean this time. There is none. 

There's no reason for me to be alive anymore. 
If I lose her I will be alone. Back on the streets or in a fucking trap house shooting up between my toes. 

Merry fucking Monday"
203,1,"Looking for advice about how to help a friend dealing with significant addiction problems. Two nights ago, an old friend reached out to me and another old friend seeking guidance and support about how to get sober. 
His specific problems include the following: at least two years of regular benzodiazepine and alcohol use, occasional other drugs including opiates and ketamine, a general anxiety and ADHD diagnosis, and a lot of past emotional trauma. He reached out clearly looking for help, but has overdosed on benzos and other drugs and taken himself to the hospital twice in the last 24 hours. Though at moments he wants to pursue a detox and rehab, at other moments he‚Äôs angry and afraid about what the future holds, and that combined with withdrawal and addiction pushes him back to using. He lives out of state, so I‚Äôm only currently able to help him remotely. He‚Äôs in his late 20s, and has struggled with addiction on and off for about a decade. He had a very strained relationship with his parents, but they‚Äôve indicated that he‚Äôs been at a hospital to treat overdose repeatedly over the last two years. 

I‚Äôm looking for any advice about how to approach a situation like this, what kinds of treatment and resources are available, or ideas about where else to find out more about how to help him. 

Thanks."
204,1,"We have a house meeting every week and the owner comes by for a short meeting to introduce anyone new, discuss the rules and any issues going on in the house, well this is what it should be for but instead we get held hostage by the owner who uses AN HOUR  to talk shit about ex members of the house, and how badly he wants to take pain killers but he cant because of his back surgery. He spends the time to proliferate drama, talk about who oded, whos homeless, all people that no longer live here that have nothing to do with us or the house. Its pathetic and nothing really gets talked about and no new information is given. I try to ignore it and secretly go on my phone but then he sees that and scolds me for being on my phone, I responded with ""sorry i dont want to talk about the drugs i desperately want to do (sarcastically)"" and he replied if you cant handle it how are you going to handle it at a meeting. A) this isnt an NA meeting, B) most people at meetings dont glorify and express how badly they want to get high, sure it happens sometimes but for the most part it is about the steps and the solution. And this guy does this. every. single. week. I tried to respond  like this, along these lines but what is the point? You cant talk sense into stupid, just like you cant talk an addict if they truly want to use. I am so close to telling him to shut the fuck up you dry drunk slum lord piece of shit. But I wont, and i am just upset that he misunderstands me, I truly DONT want to get high, and disagree with him when he says ""all addicts want to get high, all the time"" I really doubt this and think its just his his small perception, I have my moments, just like any other addict in recovery, but 90 percent of the time I truly dont want to go back to that misery. I wish I can wear earplugs to stop hearing his negativity.  


But alas it is only 1 hour out of the week. This is a pretty quiet house, not a lot of people, and so far it is manageable. trying to work a third step here...but i really wouldnt mind if the owner rebroke his back.   


TL/DR- I am bithcing about my house manager and wouldnt mind if he died in an electrical fire"

hey all.  i'm sooo close to a year sober :) -- but i've been out of work for about 6 weeks now and things are starting to look very bleak in terms of money and opportunities.  i've been on the hunt for jobs and it's bringing up all sorts of issues for me.

most notably is that my resume is full of holes.  i've been fired from pretty much every job i've ever had due to my alcoholism.  there are months long gaps from when i was either deep in active addiction or trying to get sober.  i'm not confident in what any reference from these jobs might say about me.  i currently have one former boss (who is 30 yrs sober, and gets it), and 2 friends (one owns a restaurant, the other is the head of HR at a big company) as my references.

also my work experience consists almost entirely of kitchen work, i am a chef by trade.  as much as i love it, it is just physically too much for me nowadays.  also, not a great environment for continued sobriety due to the hours, stress, drinking culture, etc.  and since i live in a medium sized city, i definitely have a reputation for being unreliable after all these years of fucking up.  plus i'm embarrassed as fuck.  so jobs in the restaurant industry are hard to come by.

anyone have any advice for how to handle this situation?  tips to improve my resume, career fields that might be good options (i have some college education but no degree), or even just a pep talk on how you got through it yourself.  thanks in advance, this has been a really rough time."

208,1,"Dearest friends,

Five years ago today, I stumbled into the rooms 

And today I am writing to express my gratitude 

My life is evidence that miracles are possible

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 I was 21 years old and I had had enough

Of bipolar disorder, resentment and vomit

Of broken glass, ashes and loneliness 

But lacking courage to end my life

&amp;#x200B;

So I made my first meeting, took the first step and set fire to my old self. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few years the time spent in these rooms has taught me:

* When uncomfortable or stressed blank ‚ÄìBe patient. **Comfortable silence** **resides within**.
* When failing or controlling ‚Äì Accept. **Let go**. **Or you will be dragged. Friction burns.**
* When self-centered ‚Äì Humility. Every time. **Always be kind. No exceptions.**
* When the path feels hard, tread lightly. **If it‚Äôs not effortless, it‚Äôs not right.** 

With discipline, I have been given the courage to rebuild my life with intention

And in exchange for faith, I have been granted an existence of belonging and serenity

&amp;#x200B;

Brothers and sisters, from love we come and to love we shall return 

Blessed is each fighter that has passed and each still to come

That no addict seeking recovery should ever die

&amp;#x200B;

And if you would like to celebrate with me today, smile.

210,1,"It's all lies. All of it, through and through. Becoming sober has brought none of the promises given. After becoming sober I have become homeless, got a serious concussion that led to me being let go and now I am back in poverty. I was sincerely better of using. 

I don't say this in a moment of weakness or anger. I am at peace with this decision. Sobriety is not something I am interested and the sober life is not something I want to be a part of. I look around at people who don't use and I don't see happiness or peace, Because it doesn't exist. 

If I die due to my substance use at least I will die not pretending substances don't bring a fulfilment sobriety doesn't. 

I respect all of you for what you are doing, it's just not for me."
211,1,"I posted this in r/addiction but I figured I would post it here too. My boyfriend (23m) is going to be 2 years sober on june 16. This is the longest he has been sober and hasn‚Äôt relapsed in over 8 years and he quit cold turkey. He was mainly addicted to meth but also used coke and is still triggered by weed (he last smoked this past august). 

Anyhow, since he has been sober he has accomplished so much and I‚Äôm beyond proud of him. For the first year that he was sober I would give him a little gift on the sobriety date each month and for his one year sobriety and I got all of his friends and family to make a video saying how proud they are of him and the compilation lasted about 45 minutes and he loved it.

He says he doesn‚Äôt follow the date of his sobriety (so I kind of feel like it matters more to me than him?) but anyway he‚Äôs going to start a new job soon where he‚Äôs going to be working a graveyard shift 12am-8am 5 days a week and then has one school from 9am-12pm and then the other 4 days a week 6pm-11pm. 

While I‚Äôm thrilled he will finally have a job in a field he enjoys, I am nervous about this schedule affecting his sobriety. When he worked in fast food he used to help him power through graveyard shifts and I‚Äôm terrified he will feel tempted to start using again.

How can I help him prevent doing this? Vitamins/supplements? I really have no clue and I really hope he doesn‚Äôt start using again :/ any help is greatly appreciated"
212,1,"in my attempt to become more responsible about myself and my life, I also feel that requires some selflessness as well.

I also feel like its going to be harder to justify to myself getting fucked up on drugs and then trying to preach kids to do otherwise.

213,1,"Hey, everyone.  Keep fighting the good fight.

I'm 31 and finally stopped drinking in October.  I started when I was 16 so it's been almost half my life with alcohol in my system weekly and as I got older, daily. 

I'm wondering if someone can answer this question I have:

Over the past couple of months I have been getting these **HORRIBLE** upper respiratory infections and it's driving me crazy.  I got sick in November, the flu in January, and today I woke up with a sore throat, a cough, and post nasal drip.  

When I was drinking I NEVER got sick.  Seriously, I felt like Matt Damon in Contagion. 

My diet has changed from eating meat to mostly plants with the help of supplemental vitamins. Maybe it could be the diet change and completely devoid of the absence of alcohol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what the hell do I do? These doctor visits are killing me financially.

Thanks!"

It's not the first thing I want to talk about when I meet someone. My past is really messy and could be interpreted as a major red flag. I'm embarrassed to some degree of the choices I've made.

218,1,"I know recovery groups are hailed as the ultimate recovery tool, but that type of mindset really impeded my recovery. 

I kept going to meetings. Trying different groups because people told me that would help. I really put in the effort. But I kept relapsing. Sometimes several relapses over a short period of time, sometimes I would gain significant time under my belt just to lose it again. And every time I relapsed, I was made to feel like it was my fault, not the program's. I just wasn't working it hard enough. So I tried again. It was a vicious cycle. 

Then, after my final relapse, I quit the recovery programs, read ""The Naked Mind,"" found a trauma therapist, and haven't had a relapse in a long time. More than that, though, I haven't even had cravings in a very long time. I've had no desire whatsoever to do anything intentionally harmful to my own body. 

It feels weird to say that, though. Because recovery groups are so entwined with the idea of sobriety. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience? For people who are sober without recovery groups, what tools, resources, or steps led you there?"

225,1,"This is my monthly plug for  [r/EndOfTheParTy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndOfTheParTy/), created for those of us who are gay and trying to leave the parTy scene. Meth use is unfortunately at an [epidemic level in the gay community](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/opinion/gay-meth-addiction.html), and it feels like we often resort to joking and stigmatizing each other about this issue rather than supporting and encouraging each other to make healthier decisions. This will be (I hope) a judgment free space where gay tweakers who are/are trying to get sober can find help through shared experiences and shared resources/approaches.

Please be respectful of the courage it takes to be open about this problem and to seek out help--some of my friends have died from meth overdoses, others are stuck in a living nightmare of permanent and irreversible psychosis. How we respond to people who are vulnerable can make all the difference for them. Please share the subreddit--or maybe [this link](https://www.actoronto.org/health-information/young-people/staying-off-crystal.pdf) about ways to limit and stop meth use--to anyone you think could use help in confronting this difficult, often ridiculed issue."
226,1,"Wondering how people feel about this kind of approach to recovery. I've been sober for just over two and a half years. My drug of choice was weed but I had occasional issues with drinking more than I wanted to.   


Through my recovery I've come to appreciate how little my addiction has had to do with the substances themselves. I've been an addict because of chronic anxiety and patterns of avoidance. I continue to see this play out with screens: my phone, TV, video games, surfing the internet, etc. I will spend more time than I want to tuned out of the world because the thought of doing what I *actually* want to do (clean my room, study for a test, folding laundry, meditate) is unpleasant and overwhelming.  


The thing is though, my recovery has been very spiritual and based in a practice of mindfulness and acceptance. Through accepting, for example, that I went longer than I wanted to without cleaning my room *and that's ok*, I've been able to shed a lot of the negative self talk (""You're lazy"", ""Your life is a mess"", ""You're never going to amount to anything"", etc) that made facing the less-than-pleasant things in life such an overwhelming and anxiety riddled process.  


Without going into too much detail, my life has changed around quite a bit since I stopped using substances. I feel like I'm in a really good place, and next month I'm going to be submitting an application to grad school. Lately I've been feeling like I could go back to using substances if I wanted to and be ok. Why would I want to? Because despite how much trouble they've caused me, substances have also enriched my life in various ways. Psychedelics have been a huge spiritual tool for me in the past (and made me confront the fact that I needed to stop using for a while). Weed is a very social substance, and I would enjoy being able to connect with certain people in my life in that way again. And I wouldn't mind making a nice boeuf bourguignon and relaxing with a nice glass of red as I sit down to dinner.  


In my mind, substances are no longer any more of an issue than internet usage. They're something that's potentially harmful to me but that means that I need to remain mindful about how I'm using them and the impact they're having on me. So right now my plan is to start grad school in the fall (about 6 months from now), graduate after another two years, and then seriously check in with myself about my relationship to sobriety. All the while I'll be continuing my recovery and working on the patterns of avoidance in my life.  


I'm wondering if anyone can relate to any of this, and/or if people know of anyone who's approached recovery in this way."
227,1,"I decided to make some big life changes this year including quitting drugs and alcohol. There was a friend circle I partied with and honestly they were not the best people, but substances mask so much of that. I did end my friendship with the main guy, who had done some shitty things to me(sexually assaulted me while I was on a bunch of drugs) and was my dealer. Everyone is so pissed off at me for it. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else had to end friendships like this and how you dealt with the aftermath? I do have a great circle of friends outside of them, and they are definitely not my oldest friends but I‚Äôm still feeling a sting."

**Pain**

‚ÄùTake a piece‚Äù she said to me,  
‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôm your friend  
‚ÄúCalmness, peace, and happiness  
No doubt a true godsend

‚ÄúAnxiety‚Äôs my middle name,‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who I am‚Äù  
Life has been so hard for me  
And this shit is my jam  
She said she‚Äôd never leave me  
But she wanted me to die  
I had a life, my future bright  
My head stuck in the sky

Her blanket sewn by satan‚Äôs hands  
Stayed draped around me tight  
She held me close  
And whispered soft  
(Stay here you‚Äôll be alright)

They taste so good I couldn‚Äôt stop  
It‚Äôs one it‚Äôs two it‚Äôs three  
False confidence and slurring words  
Why can‚Äôt she leave me be?  
She took my pep she took my step  
Is this what they call death?  
I‚Äôll have you know there was a time  
She even took my breath

I ran to him and told him  
Knowing he won‚Äôt understand  
I hurt him worse than she hurt me  
And that was not my plan

He‚Äôs crying in his room alone  
It‚Äôs taken an extreme  
The man I loved so deeply  
Felt like nothing but a dream

I wish he knew the pain I felt  
When looking in his eyes  
See that‚Äôs the thing that stupid bitch  
She taught me how to lie

But what went wrong?  
I asked myselfHow did I get so lost?  
I never loved myself enough  
And now I pay the cost

That precious brown haired little gir  
lHer big eyes filled with tears  
What‚Äôs wrong with me?  
She thought all day  
So different from her peers

Why do I care, why do I feel  
This shit is way too much  
They‚Äôre mean to me, I think I'm fat  
I couldn't eat my lunch

My tears turned into anger  
And my anger soon to rage  
I‚Äôm done with Xans, I swear I am  
It‚Äôs time to turn the page

Since then I‚Äôve told them everything  
Thank God for honesty  
Her knife‚Äôs no longer in my back  
(She left me there to bleed)

But hear me out, I lost control  
I didn‚Äôt have a choice  
She said she‚Äôd be my closest friend  
Then robbed me of my voice

I kicked her to the curb  
And while her damage is still done  
I‚Äôm strong without her now, you see  
I know she‚Äôs not the one"

Letting Go of Those Not in Recovery  
          We can go forward with our life and recoveries, even though someone we love is not yet recovering. 
          Picture a bridge. On one side of the bridge it is cold and dark. We stood there with others in the cold and darkness, doubled over in pain. Some of us developed an eating disorder to cope with the pain. Some drank; some used other drugs. Some of us lost control of our sexual behavior. Some of us obsessively focused on addicted people‚Äôs pain to distract us from our own pain. Many of us did both: we developed an addictive behavior, and distracted ourselves by focusing on other addicted people. We did not know there was a bridge. We thought we were trapped on a cliff.
          Then, some of us got lucky. Our eyes opened, by the Grace of God, because it was time. We saw the bridge. People told us what was on the other side: warmth, light, and healing from our pain. We could barely glimpse or imagine this, but we decided to start the trek across the bridge anyway. We tried to convince the people around us on the cliff that there was a bridge to a better place, but they wouldn‚Äôt listen. They couldn‚Äôt see it; they couldn‚Äôt believe. They were not ready for the journey. 
          We decided to go alone, because we believed, and because people on the other side were cheering us onward. The closer we got to the other side, the more we could see, and feel, that what we had been promised was real. There was light, warmth, healing, and love. The other side was a better place. 
          But now, there is a bridge between us and those on the other side. Sometimes, we may be tempted to go back and drag them over with us, but it cannot be done. No one can be dragged or forced across this bridge. Each person must go at his or her own choice, when the time is right. Some will come; some will stay on the other side. The choice is not ours. 
          We can love them. We can wave to them. We can holler back and forth. We can cheer them on, as others have cheered and encouraged us. But we cannot make them come over with us. 
          If our time has come to cross the bridge, or if we have already crossed and are standing in the light and warmth, we do not have to feel guilty. It is where we are meant to be. We do not have to go back to the dark cliff because another‚Äôs time has not yet come. 
          The best thing we can do is stay in the light, because it reassures others that there is a better place. And if others ever do decide to cross the bridge, we will be there to cheer them on.

Today, I will move forward with my life, despite what others are doing or not doing. I will know it is my right to cross the bridge to a better life, even if I must leave others behind to do that. I will not feel guilty; I will not feel ashamed. I know that where I am now is a better place and where I‚Äôm meant to be."
230,1,"Hi all,

I'm a recovering alcoholic 1 1/2 years sober now. I decided to cancel my plane tickets to Thailand cause I was more or less planning my relapse. I found myself saying it was O.K. if I had a drink or two over the weekend. I was thinking about if I should lie to my SMART group about the drinks I would have. It's scary how quickly I feel back into my alcoholic thinking and how fragile my sobriety is. In the meantime, I'm going to journal more to get to the bottom of this because obviously I'm trying to fill some void with drinking (I'm currently working in a rural area where there are no meetings/therapist etc. so I'm very thankful for this subreddit).

I just wanted to share. Really proud of myself for acknowledging how I feel and making the right decision. Thanks guys!"
231,1,"Ive been doing drugs for a while now but for the past 3-4 years life‚Äôs been hard. I have really bad social anxiety and sometimes short periods of depression and for the past couple years i did what i could to stay unconscious or forget what happens. I would usually smoke weed and take bars all day but recently about 6 months ago i got a partner that made everything better so i slowly tapered off the pills and only smoked every once in a while. I cant handle stressful situations at all, i like being unconscious so i don‚Äôt have to think about it, and recently i started feeling the impulse to binge on pills again when there‚Äôs problems. I don‚Äôt know what else to do because if i dont do drugs i cant function, my hands shake when im nervous and i cant build up the courage to say anything or sometimes i cant think of what to say. I just dont want to resort to substances anymore i want the impulse to go away."
232,1,"Hi guys,  


Firstly, thank you for reading this :)  


I am sober 1.3 years, got sober at the age of 24 from alcohol, weed and other drugs. Was a huge mess ( surprise) when started my recovery process.  


I got sober in AA, I live in a country where there are no other offline support groups available, I am really starting to understand that AA program is not for me, I am terrified because for the last year my life was heavily centred around it and I do believe that the reason AA worked for me was the incredible and loving support I got from the fellowship. I came to AA where I was at a stage of not caring where to go, very broken. And for the most of first year my mind was elsewhere, I did not really analyse the program, in fact I believed it's better not to, AA will only work if you believe in it and I unfortunately can't hide from myself anymore that I do not believe in some higher power participating in my life on the level of mundane, everyday activities and also do not think that mindset of ""powerlessness"" is the way i want to build my life.  


In a nutshell, I believe the social aspect of recovery community is crucial for my sobriety, and I also very much appreciated the recovery principles of AA - subtracting the God stuff- which I summarised to the principal ""Don't be a selfish \*\*\*\*\*\*\*"" for myself. I thought I will go to meetings and try to ignore the higher power stuff - but it's getting increasingly difficult and feels hypocritical.  


I would appreciate to hear your experience and stories of leaving AA and  tips for staying sober .  I also feel like the insistence of AA members that AA is the only way to stay sober is unhealthy and rigorously overemphasised to be true."
233,1,"Today is an odd day. My body and mind are shutting down. I don't even feel like a host to this mind of mine, it's just darkness. I can't stop sleeping, which is annoying at best. I don't want to stop sleeping, it's my only comfort. 
Last night i spent hours feverishly carpet surfing, to no avail, of course. I feel like a fool. My blood pressure seems to be remaining low, better when I'm laying down, standing is the worst. I'm dizzy all the time, struggling not to dissociate as all the bad feelings come rushing back. PTSD, hello my old friend. I despise these memories. How silly that once, they were my solitude, forever reminding me of my strength. Now they just seep in like the plague, reminding me of how weak I was to give in. 
I weighed myself on day 2, back down to 105 pounds. I had been doing so well, 116! But I lost it all in those few weeks, shouldn't be surprised. Now I can hardly eat without the urge to vomit. Food has no taste, just bland, foreign mush in my mouth. I force myself to eat anyways, I cannot regain strength from vapor anymore.... 
Day 3 i had parent teacher conferences, i should have been so happy for my kids, they've been doing so well. But i could hardly muster a smile. What kind of mother am i? 
Now, I'm fighting the urge to just go back to sleep. So much to do, no motivation to move. Depression is crippling me. 
I guess that's all i have to say, sorry for my scattered thoughts."

numb arms, back hurt, dizzy, fever like temperature, heart pains.

got discharged, went home, four hours later I went to the club and did more coke.

235,1,"hello, my friend struggles during recovery, we were talking yesterday about his previous relapse which happened a few months ago, he felt better after it but flashbacks came and he's scared he's going to relapse again, he has a difficult time now and is stressed cause he's going to have a job interview tomorrow, is there anything I can do?"
236,1,"I‚Äôve made such a huge turn around these past few months. 

I started drinking at 14. First time I got drunk i ended up in the hospital 3x over the legal limit but luckily didn‚Äôt need my stomach pumped. (I was chubby lol)

First time I started dabbling in pills (benzos,  amphetamines, and opiates) I was 17. I started off with Klonopins. Fell in love.  My cousin got prescribed Ativan and she‚Äôd always sell them so I started taking them frequently. Used adderal for no reason at first until I realized how clean my room/house was when taking them lol, I started on opiates when I sprained my ankle and they gave me Vicodin. 

**Here is where my life turned into complete shit** 

I started shooting coke when I was 22 (I‚Äôm 24) after my father passed away due to suicide. I had been on that slippery slope since drinking all the time at 17. Then I completely fell off because I was doing coke **a lot** since I was I think 20? Nobody knew I was shooting up. *nobody*. Not even my live in boyfriend. Around that time we were dating 7 years and had fell out of love and had complete opposite work schedules so we barley saw each other even though we lived in our own apartment. Anyway, when we got that apartment is when I started drinking a lot again after slowing down almost completely. (I‚Äôve been an alcoholic since 18/19) 

My troubles really began when I left my then boyfriend in 2018. I was shooting coke but it was every weekend or sometimes every other. We had other issues unrelated to my drugs use and so I left him. I even quit my job. &amp; I‚Äôm not proud of this and I‚Äôve apologized and paid him back recently.. buuuut when I left him (he was working) I took all his money, his weed, grabbed some of my clothes, and left. **To clarify:** that was the first and only time I have ever stolen from anybody I‚Äôm close to  like that. I‚Äôm not an asshole so I don‚Äôt rip people off. I just wasn‚Äôt in the right state of mind. I was up all night on adderal (I worked full time overnights at that time) and I have a breakdown. But the break up was better for both of us. That‚Äôs 1 good thing my addiction did for me. 

I was sober after that for 3-4 months and I was with my now boyfriend. he was sober and he helped me get off all that shit. And then I ended up assisting in his relapse. Once again, not proud at all. 

We started using once every couple months, to once a month, to once a week, to days binges. It all escalated so fast.. I couldn‚Äôt stop it (I could have but I was so fucked I didn‚Äôt realize how bad I was getting)

**Now here is the worst of my addiction**

It was beginning of last year, 2019 until recently. I started using more and more, and then going on week binges sometimes. I was living with my boyfriend (also an addict and now sober again) outside of Boston. Now, if anybody has ever here of [‚ÄúMethadone Mile‚Äù](https://www3.bostonglobe.com/news/bigpicture/2016/07/16/boston-methadone-mile/cLqxOAY7X9tHiooOGuATAI/story.html?arc404=true) you know where this story is heading. If not, click the link and it‚Äôll tell you all about it. 

If you‚Äôre to lazy I‚Äôll summarize it. It‚Äôs the Boston, MA. Well Roxbury to be specific. It‚Äôs the  ‚Äúskid row‚Äù of Massachusetts. It‚Äôs literally a mile of methadone clinics and shelters. There was South Hampton st Shelter. It is **NOT** a good place at all. It‚Äôs extremely dangerous. It was a little stretch of road  and that‚Äôs where all the drug addicts hung out. You could get **anything**. It was a lawless part of Boston. (As long as there‚Äôs no violence) people literally walk up and down the strip yelling ‚ÄúGOT THAT BROWN‚Äù ‚ÄúGOT THAT GREASE!‚Äù (Grease= potent crack) or you could just walk yourself and yell out ‚ÄúI NEED XYZ‚Äù. (Methadone Mile is no more due to the cops ‚Äúclean sweep‚Äù mission after a correctional officer got assaulted on his way to work in the jail that‚Äôs it literally 50 ft from south Hampton shelter. I actually saw it and I‚Äôm even on the camera footage) Again, **NOT** proud.

Anyway, we started hanging out down there. Shooting coke, meth, herion, crack. Anything we could get our hands on. We were a fucking mess. That lasted the entire summer. We were worn down. Looked like shit. The only advantage we had was his father allowed us to stay there. If not, I guarantee we would have stayed out there. 

So me and my boyfriend became long distance in August. (He‚Äôs in prison for violation of probation, he‚Äôs now sober too) since then, I slowed down using. I was using every few weeks (unknown to him)  

Then I stopped shooting it and starting smoking coke. Notice the little progress? 

Well. I **FINALLY* stopped since New Years. On New Years, I did *one* line and said to myself ‚Äúyou know what? No. This ends now‚Äù and I left the party.  I haven‚Äôt touched it since. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like a long time but the amount of good things that have been happening to me.. I‚Äôm proud of myself for doing it so long. 

**Here are some good things that have happened since I‚Äôve stopped using:**

1. I got a job after being unemployed for over a year. (Longest I‚Äôve ever been unemployed) and I actually love my job. 
2. I‚Äôve rekindled my relationship with my mother
3. I‚Äôm no longer too fucked up and worrying about my next high that I can help my mom with my 2 younger sisters (5 &amp; 14) 
4. My hair is healthy and my skin is clear. 
5. I‚Äôm just overall happier.
6.  I can keep money in my pocket 
7. I‚Äôm earning people‚Äôs trust back
8. I don‚Äôt turn to drugs as soon as something upsets me 
9. I‚Äôm just a much better person after all.
**10.** I‚ÄôM SOBER!"
237,1,"I spent 2 years with an ugly addiction to painkillers. They were the only thing that mattered in my life at the time and if it wasn‚Äôt for my parents, I would of lost everything. They supported me financially during this time and they had no clue about my problem. I‚Äôm 8 months sober now and I‚Äôm still recovering from the financial ruins i put myself in. A huge part of me wants to tell them, to give them an explanation for everything I put them through. But another part of me says I should leave it alone and not tell them. I don‚Äôt want to add extra stress in to their lives. I‚Äôve been battling this for a few months now and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. What‚Äôs your opinion?"
238,1,"It was a snowstorm. I didn't go too hard, but I played in it. I got in trouble with the cops, too. I won't get into specifics but I potentially have a criminal record now. Sorry guys. Hope I can still be accepted here.

So if you're feeling close to a relapse, just know, it's probably not even in your subhuman addictive self's best interest. It gets to a point that the relapse becomes not even suffering. It becomes a boredom you're so used to it's a new torture. Take care. Sending love."
239,1,"Hi im K and this happened today it was somewhere at 4-5p.m (Intel there's a family that moved here a few months ago and i didn't like the kids from the start their parents were fine i helped them with a lot of things like with the flower garden and other stuff when they first moved in before i meet the kids ).(note they had three kids and boy when i first met them I didn't want to be mean but I didn't like them one bit).The day i went to their house with my little sister I'll call her LS they where so clingy there was LEK for little entitled kid,E.P.B for entitled psycho brat,and lastly NK for nice kid (i didn't like nice kid at first because shes was to clingy but she must of been exited to make new friends). Anyway so I was eating a salad for dinner and once I'm done LS and NK eat as well (NK came over to our house) so after we ate we went into the front yard and grabbed some sticks and had a who can throw farther challenge i won a lot of the rounds because im 13 and their 10 or younger so we're throwing the sticks and we see NK 's mom and E.P.B pulled into their driveway they live 2 houses from us so E.P.B starts so come over and me and my bigger sis BI for bigger it (she's non-bi) look pissed we don't like E.P.B nor does NK but she shows NK the Pokemon she got and note E.P.B has makeup on her face like she was ready for the circus (NK had makeup on but not only did she do it better you could barely see it because we were running around a lot. So it gets to the point to where i have a huge stick in my hands and pointing it at E.P.B because she knows I don't like her near me and then NK comes over to me and whispers in my ear.....
NK: ""E.P.B is like the boss of the house.""
OP: ""is she spoiled as well?""
NK nods. I knew that from how she acted.
OP: ""that makes sense just look at her.""
E.P.B turns at me and is mad she proceeds to try to hit me and My BI with her purse and then E.P.B had the guts to say....
E.P.B: ""im going to go back home and get a gun"" ( her dad has guns but he doesn't have a vault for them). 
A few minutes later shes still here and BI is going off on her and i kept saying how I would call the cops for assault and by this time LS is still on E.P.B's side even though she threatened me and BI with a gun.
Another few minutes later she goes home and after awhile her mom and dad come out NK had to go back and i told her if they ask what happened to tell them everything she nods all the while E.P.B is behind her dads truck looking smug i couldn't tell i didn't have my glasses on so i couldn't see far away but BI told me so.

That's all i had for now sorry if it isn't that good but its my first post but I'll post if i get a update on what happened. BYE!!!"
240,1,"I'll be 30 days clean off ops tomorrow. 

I don't want to be though.

I tried going to NA again yesterday, but everyone there was older POC- and I'm a 19 yr old white dude- and I ended up leaving the building before the meeting started because I just didn't feel like it was the right meeting for me. Before I left an older man introduced himself to me, and he ended up being on the same bus as me. He asked if I had changed my mind, I said yeah, and he said I should try meetings in other parts of the city because it might be better for me. He gave me his name and number, and the address for a meeting on Sunday (today).

I decided I'd try another meeting right after, because it was only a few extra stops on a train I was already taking. I showed up, walked inside, and when I saw there were only about three people there, I turned around and went home before anyone saw me. I tried to go to the meeting the guy told me about today, but it was in a hospital and I couldn't find it, and I didn't want to ask around about NA bc that just feels uncomfortable.

My partner insists that I go to at least one meeting. They think I need help because of how bad my cravings are. They're an ex-addict as well, so while I trust their opinion I just don't want to keep exhausting myself by travelling to these places and ending up turning tf around again.

It's really really frustrating. And a huge part of me just wants to go buy and start using again. Last night I actually tried to go withdraw cash to cop, but my check hasn't gone through yet so I couldn't.

I never wanted to quit in the first place. I just had to bc I ran out of my prescription and couldn't afford pills. but now I can. The only thing holding me back from relapsing is knowing it would upset my partner a lot. Today they told me if I relapse they're gonna make me go to NA, but for now they'll trust I can deal on my own and with my therapist.

I've just lost all motivation. I've had depression for years but this is so different. I can have a really good day. Wake up energetic, happy, even. Then the thoughts start. I think about buying a few pills. Then I think about it again and again and again. and by the end of the day it's usually all that's on my mind. I don't want to do anything bc I don't see the point. I'm just gonna be miserable until I can get my fix. and I can't get that right now. I hate this. 

I just needed to let out my frustrations to ppl who aren't directly involved. Thanks if you read this all"
241,1,"I was addicted to xanax for 6 months of daily use (went from daily 0.5 to 4-6mg/day), then continued on and off for another 4 months. I relapsed in last spring and used ativan frequently (4 months of use, maybe 3-5x a week). I stopped in August 2019, entirely, after tapering off extremely slowly under a doctor's supervision (took about 2 months) but I had one lapse in January (0.5mg ativan). No benzos since.

For a while I was really  happy. I quit drinking, exercised a lot, got back into school, started to learn a new language. But then I found some articles showing the link between extended benzo abuse and early onset/development of dementia and alzheimers.

I feel so unbelievably depressed thinking about my future now. I feel like there's nothing I can do to repair my brain. I don't want to use but a small part of me is egging me on since ""you're going to go crazy anyway, might as well have fun on the way."" 

I don't really know why I'm posting. I guess because I don't know where else I can share this without harsh judgment. Thanks for reading."
242,1,"My AD is sober due to incarceration. I live far away and raise her children. She almost has a friend of mine convinced to bail her out with many conditions (live with him &amp; his child, use only a phone he controls, get a job, clean and cook, go to meetings, etc). 

I think that is way too much to expect in someone coming off of years of meth use. She disagrees and he has never lived with an addict and he thinks of her as she used to be.

She thinks ""thinking about things in jail"" is the same as rehab. She's never been to rehab. She's declined long-term rehab for mothers many times. She has been jobless and homeless for years.

So far I've kept silent. I want to warn my friend, but don't want to take away an opportunity from my daughter. A mother always keeps a faint hope...

What are the odds she's about to bring a hurricane into his home?"
243,1,"So 4 months ago when I was about 2 months sober I started volunteering for a nonprofit in my city. It‚Äôs been a great opportunity for me, and the intention was to stay there and put in at least a year to start working on cleaning up the awful work history I racked up thanks to active addiction. 

Well, another opportunity came along for a full time position closely related to the volunteer work I‚Äôm already doing and I have an interview this week! 

I absolutely love it there and I really hope I get this job. I have faith that I‚Äôm on the right path and I know that whatever happens will happen and I‚Äôll survive regardless. But I want to do the best I can and be as prepared as possible. 

I typically interview very well, but I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll ask me why I‚Äôve never stayed anywhere very long and why I was unemployed for two years prior to volunteering there. I don‚Äôt know how to answer. I‚Äôd rather not tell them I‚Äôm a recovering addict. 

Does anyone here have any advice for how to handle this question if it comes up?"
244,1,Hi. Last night I relapsed on my DOC (cocaine) and now I‚Äôm scared and panicking and high. Please help tell me it‚Äôll be ok and calm me down.
245,1,"I (28f) have been sober for a few months and my partner (27m) has been incredibly supportive and encouraging, but he is not an addict and is still drinking occasionally. 

I was originally worried I would be tempted by his drinking, but I‚Äôm instead finding myself disgusted by the way it smells on him and annoyed when he comes home after having a few drinks with friends. It‚Äôs been the source of unnecessary fights, and is causing a lot of strain and stress in my relationship with him. 

Does anyone have any tips for navigating this? I don‚Äôt want to ask him to stop completely. I don‚Äôt feel like that is fair to him to have to give up something just because I struggle with it. He doesn‚Äôt drink around me or keep it in the house at all."
246,1,"(X-posting to r/marriage )

Okay, bear with me because this might get a little long. 

My husband (35m) and I (34f) are high school sweethearts. We have been together for almost 20 years, married for 5 of those. We had always gotten high together but after I had my first daughter our drug use got out of control and we both ended up having a raging addiction to oxy‚Äôs and heroin. I got clean about 7 years ago, he got clean a few months after I did. I got on the suboxone program and after months of him taking mine I told him he had to get himself on the program or that was it. Things have been awesome since we got on the program, we both have good jobs, drive nice cars, own our home, and I recently went back to school to pursue my substance abuse counselor license. 

Things changed back in may though. My husband decided he didn‚Äôt want to take suboxone anymore, so he went through a detox and got off of it. He did great for the first two months, and then I think the never-ending lethargy and lack of motivation started to get to him. He started drinking every day. After a month of that I put my foot down and told him I would not stay married to an alcoholic. We have had so many arguments, I just can‚Äôt take it any more. I have so many dreams of using now and my stress level is at a constant 100%. He stopped drinking during the week, but once he starts drinking on Friday afternoon he doesn‚Äôt stop until late Sunday night. When he has a long weekend off or any day off, he spends it drinking. I took him to a concert a couple weeks ago for his birthday, and he drank Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, took Tuesday-Thursday off, and started drinking on Friday again. He tells me he doesn‚Äôt have a problem because he only drinks on the weekends. I am at a loss. I have told him that I can‚Äôt be with him if he chooses to continue, (my dad and brother are alcoholics, I lost my dad to drinking and driving when I was 12 so alcohol is the one thing I can‚Äôt tolerate). Even though I am going to school for this, I‚Äôm having a hard time dealing with it in my own life. Our daughters are 9 and 13 and they love their father dearly, which complicates things. I‚Äôve tried being supportive, I‚Äôve tried being firm, nothing gets through to him. My patience has run out though and he knows I am at the end of my rope but he still does it. I just want to know what other people think and what they would do, some outside perspective might help me make a decision."
247,1,"I‚Äôm trying to fix my sleep schedule because I‚Äôm starting a new job on Monday that will require me to be a morning person. I‚Äôm 2 months sober and I know in the beginning I was sleeping a lot because my body was healing, but I thought it would have regulated itself by now. 

Last night in order to try and wake up early today, I went to bed, turned off phone/tv by 11:30 and was finally out by around 12:15am. I couldn‚Äôt get myself up until 12:30pm. I even set my alarm for 8:30 but slept through it. I don‚Äôt think any normal person needs 12 hours of sleep. My new job is going to require me to be up no later than 6am. 

Any advice? Maybe I‚Äôm just depressed?"

250,1,"Never thought I'd see the day

About two years ago I hit my lowest point ; pan handling on the street, lost my career, fiance left me, drinking hand sanitizer and mouth wash when I could get it. Family intervened and took all my firearms away. I still have no recollection as to the events that proceeded that.

Did one stint in rehab, was kicked out when they found me passed out on my floor in my underwear having pissed myself. Did another stay in rehab, this time for a year. Moved out of there, decided to stay in the city that it was in and enroll in college where I now study mental health and addictions.

Thank God and and AA, because I could never have done it myself.

Hope everyone has a good day! :D"

253,1,"The inevitable has come, today is the day, and I am left with nothing but dust....

I have been so proud of myself this last week, tapering my doses and sticking to my schedule. I don't know why I thought this would help ease my detox, it hasn't. After my last dose yesterday morning, I slept for hours, all I dreamt of was redosing. I woke up to a phone call, to the sound of your voice, you are forever keeping me grounded. I blocked my plugs number with shaky hands and slowly drifted back off into my numb slumber. 

This morning, when I opened my eyes, I felt my body starting to react to the absence of the poison. My blood pressure crashed, my body temperature is the lowest I've ever seen it, my once beautiful face now pale with sharp cheekbones and shadowed eyes, my lips are cracked and bleeding, a sharp pain in my stomach, a darkness in my mind... How foolish I was to be hopeful that the inevitable could be avoided this time. Now I shake as my skin crawls, every vein begging for a taste of that poison, my lover, for she is my only cure.

Asleep again, plagued with memories of using. How it felt, all those months ago, to feel it for the first time... How it used to make me dance, how it made me feel like I was super woman, how I became the world's most productive worker and mother. But when I opened my eyes, moments later, I am reminded of the damage I have caused... 

I called the kids in sick from school today, claiming the family had all come down with the flu. The reality is I couldn't drive them safely, fuck I couldn't even stand. We're all in the living room, I'm letting them watch TV and tell them mommies sick so they need to be good to me today. My 9 year old feeds his little brother breakfast, and he leaves me a poptart next to my chair. These boys, I have failed them... 

I know I could have it much worse, that my life isn't as bad as many of those before me. I have been an expert at hiding, well, mostly... But, in retrospect, I could have failed more, despite feeling I've been the worst. No jail time, no institution, no social workers at my door, no suspecting teachers or coworkers or friends.... I tell myself it could be much worse, I still have something left to rebuild. None of those thoughts stop me from the guilt, none of those thoughts can ease the crushing weight of the things I've done. 

How did this begin you ask? It's been a life long affair really. I started out as a foster kid, knowing exactly how to handle that first baggie, knowing damn well what it does to people, having seen it and lived it, but I didnt care, I was so numb and dead inside, and in actuality, no one would even care. So it was then I met the love of my life, her poison washed over me, making me feel like the first time I was truely alive. She gave me confidence, she allowed me to survive, she got me through the years of abuse and unwanted touches, she kept me firm on my journey and eyes set ahead on my goals. 

Years later I was adopted by a wealthy family. They had horses, even bought one just for me. It was a dream come true, everything I had ever wanted. They loved me as if they made me, even though by that time i was already 14. I remember the first time I quit, mom thought I had the flu, she stayed home from work and took care of me. My body bounced back quickly, back to school i went.. No one ever knew back then, by that time the substance was such a constant in my life that no one had even seen me sober. Straight a student, president of my 4H club, captain of the swim team... But now they all knew something was off, i wasnt myself... I began to lose friends, i withdrew, i dropped out of the swim team, and i asked my mom if i could go to school online instead. I got sober for the first time at 16, but it didnt last long. I went right back to the only love I've ever known, and she was there to welcome me. This time was different, she didnt treat me like she did before... 

Maybe I had chaged? Maybe because I was no longer using for the sense of survival? In either case she brought hell... At 17 my parents forced me into a rehab program, their disappointment was immeasurable. They didn't understand what happened, why I did this, why I ""changed"". They could never understand that all I was trying to do was be myself! I finished highschool online, somehow still managing a 4.0. I graduated early, top 3 of my class, and with honors, that's about every thing I accomplished in rehab. Still, I was able to find my footing and decide I wanted to live without my love. 

And I did! For 12 long years, I lived my life of sobriety. I went the college. At 19 I bought a house. By 20 I met the man of my dreams. Years passed and he became abusive, we had two kids, and I left him at 24 after his abuse shifted to the boys, for I knew I was a strong woman, and I would give my children the childhood I never had. Fast forward, he dipped state,I struggled to support two kids financially but I managed. Met another man, we dated two years, split on mutual terms, he's still my friend, just texted this morning acutally. And then I met *her* and my entire world shifted. My heart stopped the moment our eyes met, and from that point forward it's like it beat only for her. And to this day, it still does. 

... Looking back I dont know how I got to where I am now. Things just slowly fell to pieces. I lost focus, I gave too much maybe, and then I gave in. 

Idk. I'm going to cry again. I should shower, I feel so gross. Maybe I'll write more later."
254,1,"i am 35, i know, vaping is supposed to be a teenager thing. i used one for almost three years, very expensive habit and i hated myself for how attached i was to the thing, and worried what that much nicotine was doing to my body, my veins in particular.

Prior to this i had two long term relationships that were generally healthy, and I graduated with my bachelors in three years. I had been developing an addiction to adderall and Benzos in this time. Those two didn‚Äôt translate to my working life well when I graduated in 2015 and so I started drinking, right, because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a drunk just a drug addict‚Äù, for lack of a long story I‚Äôm worse with booze than anything now I have taken adderall or kpins/Ativan/xanex a handful of times, in the last 2 or so years.

Long story short I had to leave the IOP to secure a job that worked with my new transitional house and had to stay at my moms for the interim, 7 days, today was day 6, last night I ran out of remeron, the sleeping med, so I went to get one of her trazodone and sitting right there was an adderall, I ended up taking it this morning, felt guilty at this temp job I got and just walked out mid shift knowing I was going to get drunk because that‚Äôs what adderall makes me obsess about.

I only had 45 days, my hopes were so high and my bills so behind but I had hope I listen to no rap or negative music/media anymore, I journaled a lot, I listen to sermons at the gym and I‚Äôm not even religious. I‚Äôm college educated and pretty smart according to what people say, I‚Äôm 29, I have Zero kids, I get a lot of attention from women, and a lot to live for.  This process has taught me so very much but I feel like it‚Äôs just like what the fuck at this point. I‚Äôll never quit quitting but, honestly, sometime I wish I would just get popped for a second dui or something because then I could focus on one thing, staying sober, and saying fuck all to everything else.

I just get so stressed about bills like my student loans and my car that I have to work a ton like this job told me 7a-3p, then it was 5a-3p, I wake up at 4am religiously as is so I can lift and journal/meditate/pray in am...I digress, but honestly I feel like saying fuck it turning my car into the bank and going deliquent on my loans or getting an income repayment plan I just want to get sober, like honestly my bills are only behind because I keep doing treatment but I just wish I had an easier route to sobriety. 

So, I know this slip leads to worse so I‚Äôm gonna skip all the bullshit and go to treatment for the 3rd time in...7 months.

I‚Äôm just so tired of hurting my family. My grandma, god bless her, used to tell me my one talent was bullshitting and I sell that I‚Äôm doing well without effort or intent to deceit, every time, then I hurt everyone again......

What‚Äôs it take?"
256,1,"I am 5‚Äù2 and 100 pounds and I am taking about 2-3 grams a day and unless I‚Äôm sitting down it doesn‚Äôt even phase me. What I mean is, I‚Äôm fully able to work and walk around like a perfectly normal person you would not even know I am on it. I need to quit I‚Äôm scared to die and I can‚Äôt keep living my life this way. I really want to use Kratom to try and get myself off it and I don‚Äôt know if that will work? I have Suboxone too but I guess I‚Äôm here looking for advice on if anyone has had success quitting fentanyl with Kratom. Please help. I‚Äôm a mom and I can‚Äôt go to rehab or my sons father WILL take custody and then I would be suicidal (again..)"
257,1,"I've been sober last year and the day i completed a year i had a beer with a friend. Felt not good and two days later I drank a bottle of vodka. Got so mad at myself and decided not to do it again. For a couple of weeks I was doing fine and over what I did. But I had a job offer in the same place I was getting high at all the time. I panicked and I've been fantasizing about using and drinking since then. Yesterday I got drunk and my friends tried to not let me drink but I insisted. I got home to find my mother who helped me a lot getting sober. She got angry and her trust is down right now. I feel like I'm losing control over every aspect of my life. My work, my relationships and my whole life are falling apart. My family won't trust me again and my friends also. To rebuild the fallen trust I've been working on seems like a whole lot of work I'm not able to do. I'm overwhelmed and I don't understand the depth of the urges that makes me want to use or drink. I'm so frightened that I walk the same path I had before I got sober more than a year ago."
258,1,"What an amazing journey it's been thus far.  I can only imagine what the next year might hold.  I've been writing for 4 months about recovery, and I unveiled a more polished blog today.  On this anniversary.  I like to think of it as a birthday, because a year ago, today, was a rebirth of sorts.

Love and strength to you all.

260,1,"I‚Äôve realized the longer I‚Äôve been clean, the less frequent these dreams are. I no longer crave drugs when I wake up anymore from having the dreams. but, I haven‚Äôt had one in almost a couple months until a few days ago. It‚Äôs kinda crazy, I used to shoot coke and in the dreams like I can *feel* that same rush. It‚Äôs honestly kind of intense sometimes. But truthfully, I enjoy those dreams because it‚Äôs like getting the rush without actually relapsing and the nasty come down. Although, I *do* know myself and I‚Äôm afraid if I start to get them frequently again I‚Äôll start to get the cravings and you know what comes next. I‚Äôve shockingly have done extremely well this past time cleaning up. I do have confidence I can stop myself.. but am I the only one who stills worries that they‚Äôll come across that really shitty day where you feel you can‚Äôt stop yourself? I‚Äôve worked to hard for that to happen. I went from shooting coke almost everyday to smoking it here and there down to **zero** use for the past months I‚Äôve started working again.

Sobriety Entrees:

-Started February 5th 2020 at 1:48am while I‚Äôve been awake for what will become 3 days in a few short hours. Alright then...start writing, Fuckboi, let the truth out.

Currently I‚Äôm six weeks clean off roughly 11 years of sniffing Gunpowder Heroin, and moving it. Shit, before I jumped in that game in my  20s (34 now) I was sniffing any and every pain pill around me since age 12 and burning trees. I‚Äôve even bullshitted my way through the healthcare system to get literal hundreds of 10mg K56 Roxies every month, and 90 1mg Klonopins that are still refillable as I‚Äôm tapping this screen, all covered by my insurance with zero Copay, thanks taxpayers! Oh and by the way I‚Äôd turn around and sell every single one every month profiting literally thousands off the eyes of the same broken souls that stare at me in the mirror. That was just throw away money to me too (I just wanted to see how far I could ride the healthcare system, wasn‚Äôt even drug tested until I already had the scripts) By then I was making $1G+ weekly off Heroin.. The hunger for more though...driven by the idea to be a ‚ÄúMan‚Äù by any means necessary.

Being born white, blonde haired, and with blue eyes is basically a free pass at a LOT in this world. My family life was absolutely fucked though; but that‚Äôs a story for another 2:36am entree. I‚Äôve always had the white ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù around me from the day my ‚ÄúMom‚Äù pushed my solo purple ass out at barely six months; Dad already out of the picture, thanks for the sperm, Guy. Shit, I wasn‚Äôt going to down that chapter and I already wrote that... 

Anyfuckingways, eventually I learned how to use my genetics to blend in and wear whatever ‚Äúmask‚Äù the current environment required of me...nobody ever suspects the 6‚Äô4 well spoken white guy who knows how to dress (that‚Äôs a double entendre by the way. ‚ÄúDress‚Äù clearly meaning my fashion sense, but also how to ‚Äúdress‚Äù my personality to any current situation). Ohhh soo impressive. Sarcasm.

Fuck I‚Äôm so tired at the moment, but without my ‚Äúhustle‚Äù I‚Äôve lost the bullshit sense of self and purpose I manifested for myself to get here...and feeling completely lost in life, AGAIN...at 34, yeah try sleeping with that on your drug damaged brain...ohh there‚Äôs those cravings again. Surely just a bump, just a pill, just a Xanax or any Benzo will ease your mind to rest...you want to sleep anyways, right? Nooo lets keep being sober. Fuck you (my name removed), you waste of fucking raw potential. You really should‚Äôve been born some spear throwing cave dweller hundreds of years ago...Mmm sweet ignorance and simplicity, just killing, eating, and fucking. Surviving is easy, happiness and purpose in today‚Äôs world sure as fuck isn‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs coming from my ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù. Imagine where I‚Äôd be now if I was been born in to a different social economic skin color. Don‚Äôt be an ungrateful cunt, (my name removed)...you‚Äôre an ‚Äúex‚Äù drug dealer, who‚Äôd fuck ‚Äúmostly‚Äù anything that smiled at him for decades...because surely they saw something in me that I just was not aware of..(those poor women, so easily lured in to my life by my appearance, hope they all enjoyed the roller coaster before they saw ‚Äúme‚Äù) ...but you‚Äôre not a cunt.. 
Wow this entree sure took a turn from wherever the fuck I thought it was going. 

So uhh yeah that‚Äôs all for now, it‚Äôs currently 3:01am. Time to turn on the Xbox and just exist in this timeline.
Actually screw it and keep writing, Fuckboi. Let‚Äôs talk about the ‚Äúaltruistic exit strategy‚Äù you put together in the recent weeks. So as far as I know most of my organs are perfectly healthy now that the drugs are all flushed out (please come back to me! I promise I won‚Äôt keep you long...I‚Äôll keep you forever) Haha did I really just write Slayer lyrics from Dead Skin Mask in reference to my cravings!? Yep sure did, get back on track. So the other day I was rotting at the DMV for the ‚Äúreal ID‚Äù, and I signed up to be an organ donor (and paid the optional $2 donation to organ donation causes...surely that wasn‚Äôt inspired by a guilty conscience). So I figure if I off myself with a precise shot to the head from a low caliber round the rest of my organs can go to helping better people who were handed shit cards at life but still found their path. Heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, fuck give whatever you can from me to better people, please!!! 
You see I‚Äôm not a bad person, all I‚Äôve ever truly wanted from life was family, quality friends, and to show them so much love...I just got broken very young, and that wound manifested in to this screen tapping insomniac, introverted, ‚Äúex drug dealer/user‚Äù, whatever the fuck weirdo at 3:18am.

Fuck I want to use so badly again, and it‚Äôs been six fucking weeks of mostly hell!There‚Äôs always been this ‚Äúflawed‚Äù part of me that needs that Escape...even if it became my own prison. I built the fucking foundation to that jail and raised those bars around my heart willingly. It‚Äôs safe in there...

Ok that‚Äôs all for now, suppose I‚Äôll make some coffee and start this 72+hour day off!"
264,1,"I was supposed to go to an NA meeting last night, but as soon as I walked up to the building I started panicking and called an Uber to go back home.

I'm a 19 yr old college kid with a minor opioid problem and I feel like my problems aren't bad enough for me to go to NA. everyone there would be actual adults with real addictions and issues and I don't want to feel out of place or be judged.

That being said I was really mad at myself when I got back home. I cried a bit and then went to my boyfriend's, where I just laid on the couch and said nothing for a few hours, because I just felt like shit.

I want to get better because right now all I think about is using. I get a pretty big paycheck in a few days and I'm so tempted to spend it on pills, but I'm 24 days clean and don't want to go through this again. I know I need extra support but something about NA scares the shit out of me.

I know I'm probably being irrational but I don't feel like I'd belong in NA. Does anyone have advice for getting over that fear and just going?"
265,1,"Hey, redditors in recovery. I am looking at very likely switching from Subutex tablets to the sublocade shot. My insurance has already approved it, and my doctor has agreed to let me switch. I‚Äôve been stable on subutex for 4 years and I‚Äôm so ready to step off. 
My goal is to start the shot, and then after three months of being on it I am going to allow myself to taper off. Well, it won‚Äôt be a traditional taper, but the shot apparently leaves the system so slowly that weaning isn‚Äôt as bad as you would think. W/d symptoms are bearable, according to the few I‚Äôve spoken to who have gone through it.  So, I‚Äôm trying to gain some insight from those who are either on it or have been on Sublocade. I understand that it is still relatively new, and many do not yet have access to it. This is a shot in the dark, for sure. 
Thanks for sharing with me."
266,1,"I'm a bit late in posting this since I'm mostly a lurker here, but last Friday I celebrated 24 years. I've now been clean for half my life. I started in NA when I was 22 and it took two years and a few relapses (and the collapse of a relationship) for me to decide that I needed to stay clean for ME. I wasn't sure I belonged here because I'd only been using for a handful of years, I'd never been arrested, and I'd never been to jail. Eventually I learned that in my head, I'm just as sick as the rest of y'all in the rooms. Once I came to that realization, it was easier for me to get focused on my program and make the steps work for me. It's been a wild journey, but I wouldn't change it for the world.

To the newcomer who may not be sure if they belong here: listen for the similarities, not the differences; you'll eventually hear somebody share your story."
267,1,"That‚Äôs it, haha. Just wanted to put it out in the universe!"
268,1,"It was a long road to get here, but he is doing the work. I noticed on our first date that he could put away hard liquor without flinching, 3yrs ago. We moved back near his hometown for a job promotion just over 2 yrs ago and the life transition just went terribly. I have lived with partners before, he hasnt. I went beyond broke unable to find work, and his finances just werent organized to cover. This combined with old toxic friends, arrested interpersonal skills, and dysfunctional family history led to unmanaged stress, more drinking and here we are. None of it was done on purpose, it was chaos that seems to make sense now that we know where much of it has come from. 

He is not abusive, he is distant. He doesnt party in bars or have the trigger of seeing other people drink, he drinks alone at home after work. He realized he was an alcoholic in Sept 2019, and started his outpatient program this week. We have went thru spells before of almost splitting up, no sex, distance, leading up to realizing that addiction is the center of the problems we've faced. 

What can I do to support him and connect with him, without smothering him during his program? I was looking forward to having a few evenings off of work (I am a waitress) to spend time with him and it's very eerily quiet here at home. He hasnt had a drink in 3 days and I can tell he's adjusting. I have no idea what going on in his mind, I dont want to smother. He is subdued, distant and feels cold. He came home from his meeting last night almost in tears and didnt say much. I hug him and tell him I'm proud of him. I make us tea and fold his laundry. 

His program is 3 nights a week, they want more but wprk with him because his work schedule is demanding. I hope to adjust my schedule to be home at night more. I just dont know what to do to help keep it together. I DO and WILL continue to make a point to take care of me even though I hate where we live. 

But if I'm being honest I'm not sure if we will make it. I'm not sure if he is capable of showing up emotionally in the ways I need in order to build a life together. I currently feel like there may not be room for me. I hope on the other side of rehab the man I met is still in there for me and us, but I also wonder if he even knows who that person is inside. 

I dont want to give up on us, but I want to feel loved and wanted too. 

Any tips are appreciated. Thanks in advance, yall are rockstars."
269,1,"I know it's a long shot, but I was wondering if any are on this page? Yes I know I was addicted to Robitussin üòÇ. That shit got me to where I wanted to be for quite a while. Nearly 3 years of daily use üò¨."
270,1,I relapsed on meth when I was 2 weeks sober(longest time sober since idk when) and it lasted a little over a month. Now I‚Äôm back at 5 days sober and literally all I want is just one more hit. I never realized just how much of a daily battle this addiction is. I‚Äôm gaining weight again and I feel ugly but I‚Äôm too tired/lazy to start working out. All day long i‚Äôve been trying to distract myself from hitting my dude up and so far so good but idk how much longer I can do this :/
271,1,"So I'm 16 years old from sweden and been in rehab since I've been 14 I lived at a rehab for 1 year and 3 months was there only for smoking weed and that my father was a addict, it worked out really good the first 10 months didn't take anything went to school stopped smoking cigarettes for a while everything went good but 10 months passed and nothing happened I was just there no rehab at all in my opinion I meet a drug therapist 1 day every week but anyway 10 months and nothing happened they said i couldn't move back home even though i did everything so I thought fuck it nothing happens anyway so I ran away a couple of times at 1 time I first discovered esctasy and I loved it alot, so 5 months passes and I moved to a foster home and everything worked out for about 3 months but all i did every day was playing games because i didn't know anyone where i moved so after a while i started to get bored so i started smoking weed and then a esctasy then 1 day social services came to the foster home and took me to a rehab and been here for 7 months now but the problem is I collapse like once every month on esctasy/MDMA everytime I go on a permission I collapse because I like mdma too much so I need some help to fight the cravings for the drug I've been clean for a month now or something and I'm afraid that i will collapse again i get these thoughts that I want to take something any help would be appreciated.

272,1,"It is on page 149 of the 12 and 12.

Been in AA for 31 years and had never run across this.  

Really apt and important!"
273,1,"Sorry if this isn't the right sub, certainly remove it if it's breaking any of the rules or intentions of the sub please.
I'm in my mid-forties, and have been a functioning addict 4 all of my life. I drank heavily and indulged in anything I could get my hands on until I was in my mid-20s, starting around 14. In my early twenties I developed a love for speed, as a result of the circles that I ran in, mainly cocaine. I've always beenable 2 maintain a job, and my relationships usually allowed for me to sell to other users, that I might get my own Supply relatively inexpensively.
By my early thirties, through seemingly endless struggle, I was able to stop using everything but pot. With the current attitude surrounding marijuana, I feel silly even posting this. I don't feel the problem is with marijuana itself, but it has everything to do with my attitudes and the way that I think.
 I'm simply an addict.
Regardless of what it is that I feel is providing me with my happy space, I go ahead at 110%... and then figure out how to push the envelope further. My life has been littered with behaviors that I had to cut out completely because I couldn't figure out how to participate in a healthy moderate manner.
My days are the same as they've always been, I wake up 5 in the morning start smoking, work out, smoke, head to work where I proceed to smoke 4 to 5 times throughout my work day, before heading home to wash rinse and repeat. I should share that this is absolutely Anon acceptable behavior in my workplace. I would instantly lose my job, which is subject to drug testing, if my usage were discovered. I have a wonderful wife who at most drinks a few glasses of wine throughout the course of a year, and I feel like she deserves somebody stronger.
The deal is, after everything else that I done, herb just seems so not dangerous. I feel like I've learned things from it, but I also feel like I'm ready to move on. There's nothing about the substance that I feel is problematic, rather the problem resides within my head. The problem resides in trying to stay as high as I can all day, because that helps to keep my mind from searching for other things, and it scares me a bit.
I had overdosed a couple of times as a teenager, and I have been through several faith-based recovery programs, but my faith has become very personal, and no longer aligns with the recovery programs of which I am aware.
Are there recovery programs for people who are simply addicts? I think it's more of the adrenaline and escape-probably just the escape-that I am addicted to. I've been in counseling for almost a year now, and while it has shed some light on some of the issues in my past and I am working through that, I don't feel like we're making any progress on my issues with being sober.
Anyone out there with similar histories, or suggestions?
Thank you if you have read this, and congratulations on choosing sobriety."
274,1,"Hi all -
I'm 26F (actually tomorrow is my birthday!), 117lb, Native American/Caucasian.

Today I am 180 days clean of adderall/Vyvanse, and I think I may still be experiencing PAWS? I took Vyvsane for 4 years and then switched to Adderall in February of 2019, and quit cold turkey on August 7th, 2019 after having some extreme weight loss / appetite changes, plus a whole bunch of other things.

Has anyone else experienced PAWS from Adderall and/or Vyvanse? I'm having a really hard time with my anxiety most days, and it feels as though I'm constantly pulling myself away from the edge of panic at all times. Some days are better than others, but for the last 3 or so days it's been really bad and I just feel like there's no end in sight.

I went to my PD and they gave me Zoloft, which I requested, because its helped me with my anxiety in the past. I have yet to take it though because I want to try to get through this on my own. 

Any and all help is much appreciated!"
275,1,"Guys I got a new job today! Well, pending a drug test, but considering I‚Äôm 57 days sober today from drugs and alcohol I don‚Äôt think that should be a problem... I‚Äôm FINALLY getting out of the restaurant industry after 15 years of being stuck in it. I‚Äôll be working at this cool hands-on science museum, handling animals, teaching kids, and making public presentations in front of large audiences in an imax theater. There‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äôd be able to do this if I wasn‚Äôt sober. I wouldn‚Äôt have the confidence or mental capacity to talk about animals and science in front of hundreds of people. I‚Äôm so excited!!!"
276,1,"I fought hard, believed in myself and drained the life blood of virgins for a full century, and now I can say I have been clean for 100 years today (besides the virgin blood of course).

Wish me luck at another 100!"
277,1,"Hi there, awesome people. So, this is a long story but I'm going to try and make it short. When I was 17, i met a guy who took adderall and I started to dabble with it myself. I lost tons of weight, and got down to 85 lbs (I'm a female btw) and developed anorexia as well. This went on for about 4 months until my mother caught me and decided to break the two of us up and due to this, i stopped taking the adderall. 

After a couple of weeks, i found that I was putting some weight on and decided to start purging. I was still gaining weight, but the purging gave me comfort in the fact that I wasn't putting on TOO MUCH weight. After the bulimic episodes, which lasted about 2-3 months, i decided to see a Dr. That my mom referred me to, and got an adderall script of my own. After that, things started getting out of control. 

I was taking the stuff daily (about 10 mg) and started to lose weight, again. Only this time around it wasn't just weight loss. I was also gurning, and clenching my teeth like a mad woman. My skin started to feel disgusting, and I still wasn't eating enough. Eventually, i got up to 15 mgs and at this time i was doing coke with an ex boyfriend occasionally, and staying up for almost 3-4 days at a time. I didn't even feel human. I just felt robotic and emotion-less. Waiting for the next day so I could pop another addy, and clean my already clean room for 8 hours. Anyway, i started noticing things getting out of hand after I hit that 20 mg mark, i was just a full blown crackhead at that point. Same routine everyday. I would take my pill, chain smoke 2 packs of cigs, forget to eat and repeat. After about 3 weeks of taking 20 mgs, i decided I hit rock bottom and quit. Flushed my whole prescription and never looked back. It's been about 5 months since I quit adderall, and 4 months since I quit smoking. I gained 40 pounds and I still feel like i look like I just quit adderall. I feel like it's written all over my face. It was just 1 year of that second adderall episode, but I know what it can do to a person now. At the moment, im just trying to cope with the consequences of my actions, but I've found it so hard to forgive myself. I feel like i will look and be this way forever. Tired, gross and unhealthy. 

Is there anyone out there who understands what I'm talking about or can share their experience with me? Will I stay this way forever, or will things look better as I continue with my journey in sobriety? Thanks for listening and I hope you guys can help me out."
278,1,I messed around with benzos the last 4 months but the worst I did was two weeks in a row. It‚Äôs only been a week 100% clean but is it really that? I puked twice last night with zero fever. I have had cold sweats too. I‚Äôm so miserable I want to be dead. I can‚Äôt do anything. I can‚Äôt be productive. I‚Äôm so fucking done. Ughhhh. Wtf do I do
279,1,"You know what I hate, about being clean? I mean there are innumerable gifts in sobriety, FROM sobriety, but one thing I still can‚Äôt help but hate is when I feel weird. I hate feeling unusual, different, like I can‚Äôt participate just because I‚Äôm sober. I mean, I got sober SO I COULD participate in life. But there are still things, times, events, where drinking is so woven into the fabric of it, that I can‚Äôt help but feel like an outsider.

The super bowl is basically the best example of this for me. 

This year will be my second super bowl sober ‚Äî I got clean 5/13/2018. I love football, but more than that, I love to get together with people and drink. Even if everyone else was on beer #2, while I was using the last swallow of beer #7 to wash down some oxy in the bathroom before picking up #8. Even if I didn‚Äôt know the people that well, or didn‚Äôt care about the teams playing. Even if I didn‚Äôt especially like the people I was with. It was a day out of the year that I looked forward to, that I felt like I could day-drink in good company and feel good about it. 

The super bowl comes every year, and now I‚Äôm clean. I normally feel good, satisfied with my life decisions, but during the super bowl I kinda fall back into feeling weird. But just like super bowl Sunday comes every year, so does Monday. Whether I like it or not. And now I get to wake up on Monday without any embarrassments or regrets. I might be a little afraid people at work will ask me what I did, and I‚Äôll have to admit I just went to the gym then watched it at home with my wife. But at least I don‚Äôt have to wake up wondering how I got here, or when I fell asleep, or what I did or said, or what embarrassing place I threw up. 

Today is super bowl Sunday. Since I got clean, I got my private pilot license, and I‚Äôm working on my instrument rating. Tomorrow morning, I am meeting my instructor at 4:30am for a flight lesson, to prepare for my checkride that‚Äôs scheduled in about 5 weeks. I try not to bitch and moan about my sobriety because truthfully, I get to do things today that I never would have even DREAMED of when I was using. And while I still haven‚Äôt totally figured out how to be comfortable in large groups of people without drinking, or how to participate in these big American holidays like the super bowl or 4th of July... I‚Äôm deeply appreciative of what I DO have. I have a life now where I get to push myself, where I get to line up difficult challenges and then work really hard to achieve them without colossally fucking up. My wife is pregnant, and now I get to be that dude in a meeting talking about how grateful I am that my child hasn‚Äôt seen me piss myself or drive drunk. 

I am immensely, deeply grateful that I now have a life that I‚Äôm really proud of. If I have to give up the super bowl for that, then fuck it. It‚Äôs an easy choice"
280,1,"Hey guys, 

I didn't do a lot of coke but from time to time on a party I did it. Problem was that every time it was quite good and I only felt worse the day after, so I didn't think that it can do me any harm. Every time after 2 days I was completely alright. The last time I did it was the most I've ever done, it was 2 weeks ago and basically from that time I feel somehow different. It's this constant feeling that I am looking on the world through glass, I don't feel like me. I am thinking all the time if I didn't fuck up my brain permanently and from time to time I have panic attacks about it. I am very sure I don't want any more coke but I am just so scared if I'll go back to normal. I finally was getting good in life after a big accident and a break up and then this happens. 

Also I did quite a lot of alcohol, was getting fucked up probably twice a week. I want to stop drinking for at least a month now till I get back to normal hopefully.

Will I be OK? Should I seek therapist help?

Thanks."
281,1," So I‚Äôve been going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for quite some time now with my dad. Neither of us drink and he claims to go because he wants to meet people and reconnect with old friends apparently. I just go just for my personal amusement. It‚Äôs fun to watch losers talk about their pathetic lives in front of other losers.

But as you would expect, I‚Äôm not vocal at all about this at meetings. I just sit there silently trying to blend in without saying anything aside from the shit that everyone else says when everyone holds hands and are in a circle. It‚Äôs a feeling of *epicaricacy* that is hidden from everyone else.

I‚Äôve heard some unique stories from my time there. There was once this man who grew up with his adopted family in Tijuana and then one day a robber came murdered his entire family when he wasn‚Äôt home. This guy claimed that the event put him in ‚Äúso much rage‚Äù that‚Äôs what made him a drinker. When I told The Boy Named Crow about this, he just said ‚ÄúDamn that sucks.‚Äù. I said I thought that moment was pretty funny because of how cartoonish it was. It‚Äôs kinda weird that this one guy was apparently able to murder an entire household when just trying to kill 2 people on your own can be pretty difficult. It just fell into the realm of unreality.

There always seems to be an old woman with brown hair whenever I go there. I don‚Äôt know why.

Yesterday me and dad went to this meeting and this guy was telling this very long story and since we just walked in during the middle of it I don‚Äôt really know the whole story and he kept going on about rabbis and god or whatever. The room was really dark which made sense since it was at 10 something PM and I just kept staring at the white LED lights hung on the wall behind him as he spoke and the patterns they made or the ceiling fan and the slow movement it made before it made it‚Äôs eventual stop. I remember there was this old guy sitting in a chair in a corner of the room on my right saying stuff like ‚ÄúOh god is this guy still talking?‚Äù but no one except me seemed to notice him when he said that at all.

When the guy finally stopped talking all of a sudden some guy in the crowd got up with his shitty acoustic guitar and started playing some shitty song and singing. I told dad ‚ÄúThis song is shit.‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe should split.‚Äù. But dad wanted to stay and said no and I can just go to the car and wait for him if I‚Äôd like. But I insisted that ‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù and eventually I decided to walk home by myself and asked for house keys, which he gave to me.

I just walked home alone that night listening to some podcast that doesn‚Äôt suck and went to sleep not long after returning home.

Some days I just wish I could normally use drugs. I'm not going to use tonight but somedays I just hate that I have to do it."
283,1,"Well I've spent the last 8 years building a steady stash of friends who all use drugs because it's where I felt I fitted in to society and made me feel kinda cool I guess to be honest.

The problem is some of them are good friends to me yet like yesterday there was weed ket lsd benzos alcohol all around and while they know not to offer me especially the ket I knew I could get some bumps.

If I hadn't been to my first two NA meetings I would have gave in and got high. I'm happy I woke up today with my near month of sobriety still but I'm so torn because I'm gyming doing meetings but I still get lonley and like human contact."
284,1,"I have 6 months sober today and I‚Äôm just so happy to be where I am. My counselor told me when I first got l to rehab that they‚Äôd ‚Äúrather be miserable and high than miserable and sober‚Äù as a way to convince me that it really does get better- and today I believe them.

287,1,    Just got the horrible news of a close friend passing. She was in recovery then slowly stopped going to meetings and working with others. This disease kills us. If you are struggling tonight I'm thinking and  praying about you. Please be safe out there and reach out if you need to. RIP close friend you are already missed.
288,1,"‚ÄúRock bottom‚Äù is so subjective. When I dare look at some of the horrors I‚Äôve put myself through during my drinking ‚Äúcareer‚Äù over the past 20 years, I thank my luck or guardian angel, or whatever kept me from killing either myself or someone else I care about. 

I‚Äôve attempted and been temporarily successful at sobriety for 3 months only twice in my life, both times ending the drought by becoming even more uncontrollable and unpredictable. 

These past 2 years have been filled with behaviours that are almost crippling me with the shame I feel, and every time I drink I hate myself for it. 

My husband, my mum and my kids all think I gave up when I had my DUI a year ago, so I‚Äôve once again placed myself in an isolating situation. I can‚Äôt tell my husband I‚Äôve been lying to him yet again and my mum would quite possibly disown me. 

I stumbled across Laura McKowen‚Äôs book, We Are the Luckiest, and now here I am, uncomfortable and restless, but also grateful to have woken up with no hangover."
290,1,"My journey on quitting drinking has been a new one. Recently I have weened myself off drinking every night and yesterday I attended my first SMART Recovery meeting. I feel confident I can do this but what's been the hardest is dealing with my anxiety. I started drinking a lot as a way to self medicate myself for my anxiety. And I have to say it worked, at first. But as time went on and I was drinking more and more, my anxiety just got worse. It's a vicious cycle and this is one of the reasons I have decided to stop drinking. Now that I have  stopped my daily drinking I feel I need to work on non medicated ways to help settle my anxiety. If you are like me, what sort of tools, activities or suggestions do you have that might help me tame anxiety?"
291,1,"Sitting here at 1am 53 days sober. 2 months ago at 1am, I‚Äôd honestly probably still be at work. I‚Äôd probably have a liter of wine in my backpack counting down minutes until the bar closed so that I could shut the place down, hurry up, get home, wind down and drink alone. I would honestly probably still be doing that right now but I got fired from that job 51 days ago. 

Sobriety has been a real test on me. Heartache, losing my job, and as of Monday, two deaths.. my uncle just passed away. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of soul searching. I‚Äôve cried a lot. Somehow through it all though, I‚Äôm a better person. I‚Äôm not as hot-headed, angry, bitchy, and temperamental as I used to be. I‚Äôm not as impulsive. I don‚Äôt have a death wish anymore... and I‚Äôve started painting again. 

I think I‚Äôm starting to heal... but the thing about healing is sometimes the wounds still sting and itch. The scars will always remind you. But nevertheless, you start to heal and maybe one day the scars will fade."
292,1,I've seen this quite a bit in my short time in recovery and it makes me uncomfortable. Not everyone knows I'm a recovering alcoholic so I'm not sure how or if I should address it.
294,1,"Hey all.  I'm struggling stopping drinking.  Haven't eaten in a week and currently throwing up every ten minutes and have been for the past couple hours, I'm just trying to keep water down.  Anyone else gone through this.  It's from alcohol and I can't go back to rehab can't afford it."
295,1,"Ended up with some white in my pocket last weekend and all this week I've been habitually doing bumps and though I can feel my system is a bit practiced and strengthened for fighting addictive tendencies, I obviously still am having trouble seeing the reasons for sobriety if I can just sneak in cocaine over the course of a week and be all panicked and confused when I run out. 

I only did maybe a gram lol. But I can still feel myself going back to that spiral. The shaky hands, racing thoughts, tension, wide eyed and sore jaw existence are appearing on my horizon. Having shameful thoughts of my family and where my life is going and how bad I am at taking care of myself. I seem to go from 0-100 with health, forcing myself to be ludicrously healthy for a few days then falling out of that routine into sub-par habits, but when liquor and hard drugs come into the equation I lose sight of everything I believed in as a sober person. You see people take hard drugs as if their parents encouraged them or that they never feel addicted. Or just not concerned about it. I don't know. Drug addicts fascinate me. 

Hope someone out there can drop an anchor for me and knock some sense into me. I'm really tempted to go get some more stuff and just keep having a little personal party in my apartment for the rest of the night. What I'd end up doing if I could forget that idea is probably so wholesome and productive for my life I can hardly bear to think it. Sometimes it's just easier to keep leaning in the direction you're spinning. But lo I must learn to master my own fate."
296,1,"Like lots of addicts, I really struggle with feelings and spent much of my using trying to avoid them, both positive and negative. In the first few weeks back after a relapse I'm desperately trying to cope with the sudden impact of confronting them again and one way that works so well for me is music. Rather than trying to suppress emotion, music allows me to channel it, to process it and release it in a way that doesn't overwhelm me.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of us will understand the old adage that 'the opposite of addiction is connection'. Sometimes I find myself sharing a song or specific lyric that perfectly captures an aspect of my recovery and knowing that rarely will they be in a place and time that‚Äôs conducive to them really appreciating it at the level you hoped when you shared it.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite that, there have been enough times in my life where I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of a recommendation and things really have just clicked. The stars align and they caught me in a quiet moment, giving it my full attention and it‚Äôs ended up blowing me away and becoming incredibly close to my heart. There are songs people in recovery have suggested to me that I have listened to on repeat. They've made me cry, they've given me hope, they've helped me deal with anger and frustration. 

&amp;#x200B;

The belief that just once in a while, songs I share myself might have that effect on someone is enough to keep me doing it myself. The belief that every now and then, two addicts share something meaningful to them that makes them both feel a little less alone in the fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this has struck a chord with anyone, please go ahead and share a song and any lyrics in particular that have helped you at any stage in your recovery, either here or by PM if you prefer. I guarantee that I will listen to every single one with attention and sincerity. Stay strong beautiful people."
298,1,is there anyone in your life who was instrumental in your getting and staying clean or assisted in your recovery?
299,1,"36ish days ago, man, I didn't want to come to rehab but I needed this shit so much. I feel so alive and well. I'm mainly looking for more sober support but figured I'd share my ""today's journal"" with you guys. Thanks.ü§òüèª"
301,1,"Putting down the pot. Sad day, but a good day. Very excited to begin living again and to get out of the haze I've been in for years! Been afraid to go down this road for a while; intimidated by the work and discomfort to come..but man this is what I've always wanted"
303,1,"So I was smoking outside the building where my appointment was, theres a safe consumption site in the same building. I saw a couple guys crowded together in a corner and one of them dropped a small baggie, I stopped in my tracks and just focused on on it. For a second I couldn't help myself. The dude realized he dropped it and picked it back up, so then I think ""I wonder how much he's charging?"" i suddenly realized what happened and just went up to my appointment. It can all change that quick, even after 8 years."
304,1,"Hey everyone I was wondering if any of y‚Äôall could answer some questions I have about starting up a new oxford house chapter.  I read everything on their website but wasn‚Äôt sure of a few details.  Is it generally hard to find a landlord who will accept you and how do you typically structure a lease of this kind? We talked to 3 different landlords and all three seemed skeptical of us having people come and go, and of needing to have every residents name on the lease and the extra paperwork/hassle that would be for them.  The last one we talked to said he‚Äôd consider it if we doubled the rent, seeing as we‚Äôd have 7 adults in a four bedroom.  That seemed like a rip off to us.  Is it normal to have a hard time finding a landlord who would accept this arrangement and is it normal to pay more for rent than the house would otherwise be rented to a normal family for? Thanks everyone"
305,1,"I‚Äôve been on probation for nearly two years now and I‚Äôm very close to being revoked because I can‚Äôt seem to stop smoking marijuana. I smoke to feel somewhat normal and okay: I never thought I had a problem. However I continue to be placed in jail and now I‚Äôve been given an ultimatum basically. Go to rehab or spend over a year in jail.

I don‚Äôt understand. Obviously I‚Äôm not physically addicted to marijuana and every time I get out of jail I tell myself I‚Äôm stopping because I‚Äôd rather suffer in the peace of my own home then in a cage but every time I seem to go back to it. My probation officers are now beginning to think I do it because I don‚Äôt care about rules or listening but it isn‚Äôt true. Everytime I just tell myself it‚Äôs the last time and I‚Äôll flush my system and get clean right after and it‚Äôs a vicious damn cycle.

I think rehab could benefit me but I have a few questions. First and foremost do people typically ever go to rehab for marijuana? Will any rehab take me for a marijuana problem? I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm doing it just to take an easy way out. I really do have a problem quitting."

309,1,"Hi all - I am a recovered cocaine addict and have battled with mental health issues (Borderline Personality Disorder &amp; Depression) my whole life. I found Rational Recovery by Jack Trimpey (self-help book) really helpful as I tried the 12-step programme and it wasn‚Äôt for me. The book is sold as the ‚Äúrevolutionary alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous‚Äù, although it‚Äôs helpful for any addiction (for example in my case).

I can‚Äôt remember why but I‚Äôve basically got a spare brand new copy of this book which I‚Äôm more than happy to post to anyone who really needs it (completely for free - I just want to help someone whilst clearing out some clutter and saving the planet by re-using etc). If you‚Äôre interested send me a DM (sorry I do only have one copy though!!). 

(Word of warning: I have nothing against the 12-step programme - it just wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea - but unfortunately this book does bash the 12-step programme quite a bit! Asides from that it really is a fantastic book.)"
310,1,"When I was drinking,  I would start at 6am.   My husband's car would pull out of the driveway, and I would have my first one of the day.     After I got sober, when I was newly sober, it would remain my time of day when I was at my craziest.  My problems, my thoughts would overwhelm me, and I learned that there were tools to lessen my anxiety.   The big book, other sober people, my sponsor, prayer.      Flash Forward 20 or so years, and after some rather tough years, I find myself anxious again.   And the tools are taken out of the box, and picked up again.    I'd like to think that I should not have to work so hard, that I should be able to 'rest on my laurels'.   nope.     Tried that, put some of my tools away for a few years, floated through AA and rested on my laurels.   Much easier to keep using the tools, so that they don't get rusty.  Still sober, much happier, and hoping I don't forget this particular lesson."

312,1,"I've never been good at talking to my parents. We don't really have that kind of a relationship but I think it's mostly my fault for being so closed off from them. I genuinely appreciate everything they  did for me and putting up with my belligerent ass, and I want them to know that. What are some ways to go about having a conversation like this? I've thought about writing a letter but I feel like it's too impersonal. I'd like to buy them something, but I'm broke and words mean more than material possessions."
313,1,"I'm possibly starting a step working group in a smaller fellowship that doesn't have its own literature.  

In talking to other people, it seems like the NA step guide is pretty seriously overdoing it, many redundant questions, it could be cut down by quite a bit.  A friend is currently doing an NA version of the steps and is less than half way through after a year of meeting once per week.  

I've heard that ""A Gentle Path through the 12 Steps"" is a bit wimpy and doesn't cut deep enough in step 4.

Any suggestions on a middle ground between these two extremes?  What worked for you?  

Thanks,"
314,1,"It's not that I want to use. It's just that I don't not want to, either. 

I'm emotional and restless and just want to do SOMETHING to make this feeling go away. I've been trying to distract myself but it's not helping. 

I could call a friend but when I'm like this I tend to blow up on people and I don't trust myself not to do that and damage friendships.

So I'm just sitting here, feeling like I'm going to boil over."
315,1,"
My boss just emailed me and asked if I could proof an important document tomorrow morning ahh. I feel like I wont be able to do it without addy. Idk the last time I proofed something sober. I‚Äôm worried honestly, like tbh. I‚Äôm scared and tempted to call my dealer... reaching out for supper. Hope everyone‚Äôs night is going well."
316,1,"I've been struggling, pretty severely for a while now, I can knock back a sleeve of fireball, and then hit the store for another, I've never been or felt so hopeless in my life, I cant drive past a liquor store unless, I have shots in me ,on me, or waiting at home.. I've smoked pot for more than half my life, I've always been happy with it, and it never caused a problem in my life, other than it being illegal.. this alcohol, with its legality is a demon, I've never been much of a drinker, but I've shook hands with the alcohol, iv3 spoken to family, I would never stop.  I go to AA meetings 3 sheets to the wind, wreaking of my last 3 shots. When does it end.. I'm drunk right now, while writing this.. am I looking for help? Idk,"
317,1,"I often wonder what made me drink to the level I did. What made me turn from a social normal drinker to a fill blown alcoholic ? Well it happened I never dwell on how it happened it just happened. And that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt like to look back I look forward. But now that the horse is outta the bag and I am recovering quite well .  

My triggers are the following 

1 money is my hugest it lead to my relapse because I had left my job that has a steady salary to have a job with an amazing healthcare agency that anyway ruined my financially. And the fights it caused

2. Anything dealing with my ex boyfriend when I get emotional.  Cause I knew I thought I was done. And would be married by now. 

3. Family having kids and marriage and on track and me 34 at home alcoholic in AA trying her best. Working at a great job but not paying the bills. 

Finally the one bright spot of the last six months was v. He literally was someone I have had a crush on forever and he has had a crush on me forever. We colleagues and stayed good friends over the years. And we had had a fight and we didn‚Äôt talk for a long time. One it had to do with the fact he was married and other stuff. Anyway we really did like each other. We had wanted to go out as friends and that was it. Just hang out but as soon as we did we knew it would turn. So we tried. So I wanted to keep it professional with him. I had to email him for work I am a social worker working w seniors and he is a pharmacist. I was gonna be having to utilize his pharmacy for work. So I sent him a very professional email. And expected him to pass it on to his xo worked. Nope he didn‚Äôt he was professional and then kept it professional. As soon as we talked we picked up right where we left off. And slowly over the summer we begin to see each other more and slowly but surely one night we are sitting in his car having some coffee and it was one of those moments you go oh shit..... and we had tried to hold back and we end up making out.... well anyway he‚Äôs getting divorced we are slowly beginning to date."
318,1, do you think looking at [r/drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/drugs/) during recovery can be helpful or a completely bad idea?
319,1,Does anyone have the pdf of the rational recovery book?
320,1,does sobriety from self harm count?
321,1," I would like to know guys when you decided to stop using drugs and why, if it happened thanks to your family, friends or maybe partner"
322,1,"Today (1/24) marked my ten years of sobriety! I would have laughed had anyone told me I'd hit 10 back when I was drinking &amp; using, even during the first couple years of being sober I didnt see it possible. 
But i did it! And even when there's days I don't want to &amp; I want to give it up, I'm going to continue to push through &amp; do it. 

It seems like it was just yesterday but it also seems like an entire different persons story.  

But it is indeed possible! And it feels pretty fricken good."
323,1,So I am just finishing this book up and had the thought that I should pass it on. I will pick a comment at random and send that user my copy of the book. There is only one condition: once you are done reading it you have to pay it forward.
324,1,"Im an addicted and Its a week that I've been clean from using everyday since months.
its difficult tho and this happen also bc I'm broken, no money.  yesterday 20$ comes in my pocket I tried to buy smthing but than didn't. (bc the pusher didn't answer me) but I didn't insist and take it as a ""sign"" as me first I'm sick and tired of this shit... I am a pro-weed, I take it to medicate me, it helps a lot my brain cravings, it chills them out... Also is the first time sharing on the internet, I'm not useful w that, but Im seeing sharing can helps, both who read and who write."
325,1,"I'll be checking in to a treatment center Monday morning. It'll be the second time in under a year. At least I get to pack my own bag this time. Are than any essentials you would make sure to bring? 
*unfortunately this wont be anything like Passages Malibu if that factors in*"
326,1,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this, please direct me elsewhere if not.

I have a friend that's leaving a 12 month court ordered rehab in a couple of months. He has a stable job and a vehicle, he's cut ties with friends that still use - he's doing quite well, all things considered.

That said, he has limited options post-treatment and is worried. He can't stay with family or friends because there are trust issues and he has very few close friendships. His rental history involves several evictions and his credit is shot. He's also a person who prior to treatment had a lot of difficulty managing bills; power and water frequently went unpaid (and rent, obviously.) 

I think he's feeling the pressure of transitioning from a very structured environment, to one in which he's entirely self-reliant, while simultaneously staying sober as a choice, not a rule (he's in rehab under the condition that any violations will result in serving his original 10 year sentence)

What resources are available to someone in his situation? I read about three-quarter housing- sober living facilities that offer support but mostly encourage self-sufficiency, that sounds ideal, but I'm having trouble finding specific information and locations; everything I pull up info on is just a traditional treatment center. Anyone have specific info or advice? Are there other options? He's in the Atlanta area. Thanks."
327,1,"I had seven years of sobriety in which time my life changed dramatically and so many good things happened but I was never able to fully resolve my mental health issues. 

I started drinking again last year and, honestly, it wasn‚Äôt terrible. 

Everybody in AA warned me that if I started drinking again I‚Äôd pick up where I left off but it hasn‚Äôt been that bad. 

I‚Äôve actually had some fun nights out, dancing away, meeting and getting off with women, some of its been fun.

But...I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve put on weight. I look like shit. I‚Äôm broke for the first time in years. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this is, but I‚Äôm done. 

Time to get sober again..."
329,1,"Today was one of those days where I felt a little off all day. I forgot to take my meds and I didn‚Äôt want to be at work, but I pushed through. After work I went to a meeting with my sponsee sister and now I‚Äôm just gonna hit the hay. 

My point in saying all that is that even though today was pretty mediocre by my sober standard, it was far better than a day spent fucked up. My life is 1000x better than when I was drinking and using.  I have a network of women that care about me, a connection to my higher power (the divine spirit of the universe for me), and stability. I have everything I need and I am truly blessed.

I hope the best for everyone on this sub."
330,1,"These were some of the major triggers that led me to drink before I decided to quit 46 days ago.  Struggling with these awful feelings, encountering shitty situations, and just plain old bad luck were so easily forgotten with my head in a bottle... I‚Äôd just blast my music, pour the booze, and god help whoever crossed my path that day. 

This week has been a real challenge for me. I had a job interview Monday for a job that was exactly what I was looking for and in a perfect location. I thought it went really well, I even shadowed a representative on the floor and it just felt like a good fit. On my way home from the interview, I was feeling pretty good about myself until I got a text from my mom saying we had to put my cat down... Although she was 17 years old, it wasn‚Äôt exactly expected... I thought she at least had a couple more years on her. She was still spriteful and spunky... up until the end. She just stopped eating and when my mom took her to the vet over the weekend, they discovered she was riddled with tumors. 

On top of having to watch the light fade from my cat‚Äôs eyes that day, I‚Äôve been struggling with rejection from someone I fell in love with. Just feeling a little worthless about that... his birthday was Tuesday and I just totally get a vibe that I‚Äôm nothing to him anymore, that he‚Äôs seeing other people and it sucks.... And then today I found out I didn‚Äôt get the job I wanted because the recruiters ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think I seemed interested in the position enough‚Äù whatever the hell that means. 

I‚Äôve cried a lot this week to where I honestly don‚Äôt have the energy to cry anymore. My heart hurts and I‚Äôm just feeling a little down about life. Alcohol would numb it temporarily, but it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything. It feels like sobriety is the only thing I‚Äôve got going for me right now. 

So, on that note, excuse me while I avoid the world for the rest of the day, binge watch Netflix and eat a bunch of garbage instead of getting drunk. 

I‚Äôm holding onto the idea that when you face consistent rejection, it‚Äôs because something better out there is waiting for you. I‚Äôm also holding onto the notion that my kitty is no longer in pain and that she‚Äôs in a better place now. Life is so very precious, hug your fur babies while you still have the chance.

331,1,"So, I am 23 days clean from alcohol and weed. I have dialed back my porn consumption a TON but last night I was consoling a friend who found out they lost someone while we were hanging out together and the stress of consoling my crying friend made me extremely stressed. After they left, my mind went on auto-pilot and went to the Instagram of a girl I like, and I opened a webcam site after that, and, well. 

In addition, I had a sex dream last night, and since I used to be such a stoner, remembering my dreams period wasn‚Äôt happening. It was detailed, nice dream where I had a loving partner. Then I woke up and felt utter horror. 

I know what will be said - delete instagram. I am one of those people that genuinely uses it for work and cannot so easily divorce myself from it. I have muted the posts and stories of every single woman that I know, so the only way to see a woman is for them to come up on a male friends post - at a certain point I can‚Äôt avoid seeing females, you see them in magazines, billboards driving to work, you can‚Äôt block/delete your way out of seeing the female figure - I need to get stronger about resisting the initial urge though so I have downloaded a couple apps that I think will help me with it, limiting my usage. At any rate, it didn‚Äôt feel good afterward, I felt like shit and still do. I felt much better having a few days divorced from PMO. Any advice would be great."

My partner recently relapsed on heroin - he's been using again for a few weeks after a nearly 8 year stretch of sobriety.

He recently lost his job, which triggered the relapse. He is new in town and doesn't have a support system here. He has a group of friends out of state that he's very close to - I did reach out to them to let them know so that they could reach out to him as well. His parents are not supportive and I don't want to contact them.

He has mostly stopped responding to my texts and when I have gone over to his house, he is high and not lucid. He's obviously not ready to stop but he has expressed that doesn't want to keep doing this either. I have offered my support by saying that I am happy to sit with him during a detox, bring him to MAT, go to a meeting, etc. I obviously can't force him to do anything.

I told him I didn't think it was healthy for us to spend time together when he's actively using but I want to be a part of his life and I don't want to lose him. I have texted him every day since I found out just letting him know that I'm here and he's not alone and when he's ready to be done, I'll be there. I am afraid he is going to die. I don't know what to do. He's all alone and I feel incredibly responsible and I am terrified."
335,1,"I was hooked on shooting coke for two years or so. I switched to smoking crack a few years back. I ended up moving back to my mom‚Äôs house and got clean, but drank a lot. Now I‚Äôm in my own apartment and I‚Äôm falling back into bad habits. Every time I drink I want to smoke crack. And lately it‚Äôs been happening. I‚Äôm ruining my money and mental health. I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life currently that I can talk to about all this in the moment. I‚Äôm looking for a friend/sponsor who can help me through. Anyone?"
336,1,"From the ages of 14 to 19, I struggled with substance abuse. It was primarily alcohol, opiate pain killers, and benzos, though I'd abuse my Seroquel as well. At the peak of my addiction, I had lost almost 100 lbs, was struggling to get high/drunk + therefore taking a lot, and was throwing myself at anyone who could make me feel something (cliche, I know). I voluntarily spent some time on the streets and couch surfing, was very abusive to my partner (who was also an addict), and did some messed up and degrading things just for cigarettes and food. I ended up in a situation where I was repeatedly sexually abused. It was horrifying. I was narcissistic, mean, destructive, and made impulsive decisions that hurt both me and the people I loved. I eventually overdosed and that was my wake up call. I had mixed alcohol, Vicodin, Xanax, Seroquel, and 13x the dose of another anti-psychotic I was on, and ended up in a 5-hour cycle of having seizures and then losing consciousness. Nobody got me medical attention and I was left alone for the tail-end of it. I remember hitting my head a few times and not being able to walk. I woke up the next morning in a puddle of my own piss and vomit. I should have died. I *should* have died. I don't know why I'm still here and it still trips me out to think about it. But I took that luck and ran with it; went to college, started working on getting sober, repaired my relationships with my family, made new friends, held down a job, and met an amazing man that I eventually married. I'll be 6 years sober in August. 

I hold that I have no other option but to be sober. I have to stay clean or I will ruin my life. This is something I have stood by since I completed my first year, and in a city where pretty much everyone abuses drugs (primarily opiates), it's been incredibly hard. The man I married was pretty much in the same boat, though he was addicted to other things. He thinks that pill junkies are the worst kind of people and would remind me of that often. Whatever. The first four years were pretty great despite that opinion, though. We encouraged each other to be sober. He'd do acid, molly, and shrooms from time to time and was a total stoner, but I don't consider those life-ruiners when used the way he used them. We had fun, even after the honeymoon phase. Sex never fell off and affections, acts of service, and quality time were plentiful. However, we faced our challenges. I had three miscarriages, and after my second one, I checked out completely. I was still committed to sobriety, but I became dysfunctional. All I did was wake up, go to work, then come home and hide under the covers; every damn day. I never cleaned, I rarely showered, I stopped making us coffee + breakfast, I stopped going out, I stopped talking to other people. He put pressure on himself to ""carry"" us and be my care taker. This went on for about 8 months. I had an emotional affair after all of that, and he had breakdown. He ended up relapsing. I still fucking hate myself for hurting him. Long story short, he became narcissistic, dishonest, shady, and very manipulative and emotionally abusive. I should have known his use was a big problem when he told me, ""Don't let me buy this for another 6 months"". He started telling his friends the same thing, but then looked for outside, unknown sources. He cheated and we separated. He then started using ketamine and meth. We tried to ""make it work"" for 5 months, but among the continued emotional abuse and manipulation, he kept trying to insist that I do ketamine with him. I ended it after he made me wait in a parking lot for half an hour while he went up to his dealer's apartment (where he now lives) to get high. He told me he was dropping something off and it'd be 5 minutes, but he didn't even bring the ""something"" in with him; it sat by my feet in the car. 

Now I'm having an increasingly difficult time staying sober. This has been a huge blow to me. I don't want to be with him anymore (most days) and know this is for the best, but I'm overwhelmed with grief. Everything I shared with him, the babies we lost, the moments of raw vulnerability that were new to both of us, one of the biggest reasons I stayed sober...gone. It feels like it was all for nothing and I can't even remember the good because it's overshadowed by all the abuse. Some nights I have nightmares about him. Last night my dreams were just him berating me and tearing into me, telling me that I'm nothing. On top of it all, I'm quitting smoking and going into treatment for an eating disorder. I think my cat is dying. I'm so stressed out that I'm getting rashes, despite going to therapy, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, and doing all the ""right"" things. I crave a drink like I crave a cigarette. I've been remembering exactly how it feels to take a few Vicodin and lay in bed; like I was simultaneously sinking into the mattress and floating on water. I miss it terribly. I miss affection and sex, and have been missing the man who assaulted me. I've obsessed over it so much that I now know where that man lives. I'm good most days, but these ""wants"" are always nagging at the back of my head. I'm scared of myself right now."
337,1,"So this past week I've been homeless. I posted about it here a few days ago. My check from my new job was supposed to be here today and my sober living didn't want to work with me so I made the best of my situation. This whole week I've been waiting for today. ""Just gotta make it until Wednesday"". I had a sober living lined up for today and I go into my work to pick up my pay card and I'm unable to activate it. I call the customer service number and apparently my employer didn't upload any of my information to the card. I asked to speak to my manager about it and he wouldn't even speak to me, he just had another employee tell me ""He said he e-mailed payroll"" I asked how long it would take and he said ""Could be a couple days could be a couple weeks"". I'm done. I'm sobbing hysterically and I just want to have a place to go so badly. I'm done. I'm getting high and that's the bottom line. I've tried so hard to have a good outlook on it but if I have to be homeless for an indefinite amount of time there's no way I'm staying sober. Adios"
338,1,"Please delete this if it's too off-base.  Or let me know if there is a better place to post this.  

Let me first say that while not in recovery myself,  I have been deeply impacted by the journey of recovery several of my friends and family have taken.  It is a good day every time I see them happy and clean and I am constantly in awe of the strength I see that keeps them there.

My question for anyone who might be able to help is about resoucing someone's stay at a treatment facility. 

Without going into copius details, I have a 14yo niece who is on state medical.  She needs inpatient treatment for an addiction issue (one attempted suicide as a result) and years of seeing her mother emotionally abused by her ex, so trauma counseling as well.  To add complexity, she is a type 2 diabetic who was born with chiari malformation.   The kid's had a tough row to hoe.

With all the issues, the state care is not able to get her in a facility that can address all her needs, rather they want to do addiction,  then assess if she needs trauma therapy, then assess, etc. and piecemeal her treatment.

I am looking for anyone who might be able to point me towards any groups or resources that could help her mother get her in a better facility.  One that can treat the whole person rather than pieces.  Thanks."
339,1," 

Let me preface this writing by saying that I listen to a lot of smart people.  And I read the words of a lot of smart people.  And I try to keep the company of a lot of smart people.  When I said that I surround myself with trusted individuals, it also means that I really like people and I like to take a lot in.  It was never enough for me to commit to attending 12-step meetings *and* to read one main piece of literature *and* be able to quote it like the bible. 

Truth telling:  I realize that my initial annoyance with AA was simply an adolescent railing against the idea that it felt like someone was telling me what to do.  I‚Äôve already said that I am an independent spirit, and that‚Äôs true.  And what comes along with that, is the fundamental belief that I need to figure things out for myself.  I need to take it all in and trust myself to figure out what‚Äôs right for me.  Period.  And I need others around me to trust me to do that work.  That does not mean that I don‚Äôt listen to directives from others.  I already said that my time in rehab was humbling in many ways, one of which was that I decided that I didn‚Äôt know jack shit about recovery, so I should probably just shut up and listen.  So, that‚Äôs the point.  My first decision was to *listen*.  And I did. 

That required that I really took in information, sat on it awhile, and determined the next steps required by myself.  Everything boiled down to that, so if something made absolute sense to me, and truth rang a giant cowbell in my ear, I jotted those things down in my psyche.  And sometimes on my legal pad.  I decided what the key points were, and I created the outline for my personal work moving forward.  I hope that makes sense. 

And upon returning home, I have continued to work.  I didn‚Äôt lie and set myself up for failure by verbally making a commitment to AA and the Big Book, singularly. I wasn‚Äôt ready to do that, but that by NO MEANS meant that I was not in recovery.  And if anyone thinks this to be true, then you don‚Äôt know my story of the last 10 months.  I‚Äôve read the Big Book cover to cover several times.  It‚Äôs highlighted pages and notes in the margins prove it.  I just don‚Äôt limit my studies to one book.  I have attended plenty of meetings, but I have never and do not now go to AA meetings on a regular basis.  If you are angry with me right now and feel like I‚Äôm a fraud, then let me explain.  As I read and listen to others and invest my own thoughts and feelings into what I take in, I find the following to be true:  that the clearest concepts and the most inspirational pieces of literature and teachings are usually saying the same things.  Even spiritual teachings.  If you don‚Äôt see parallels between the 12 steps of AA and ancient spiritual concepts, then please take another look.

Additionally, I have created my own fellowship with other people in recovery.  Sometimes that‚Äôs friends that are regular AA attendees, and sometimes it‚Äôs those on a different path.  I in NO WAY disagree with the Big Book or with the importance of fellowship among people in recovery.  I hold both as supremely important.  I just have chosen a more inclusive path, which does include 12-Step meetings occasionally, and also active fellowship with others.  Dinners with other sober friends where we openly and intentionally talk about recovery, texting and calling friends from rehab, discussions of helpful literature with others, conversations with my husband (who never became addicted, but understands it well).  It‚Äôs all very intentional fellowship, and it‚Äôs been working for me all this time.  And I feel it‚Äôs important to point out this fact:  I DO KNOW that AA *is and will always be* a place where I can find fellowship, support, and guiding principals that I believe in.

I also need to clarify that I have not just *read* words.  Or just *listened* to a podcast.  My recovery has not been based on simple intake, as if anything magical happens when we passively absorb information.¬†¬†My recovery has been based on *choices and action and proactive involvement in service* to my better self and to others.¬† I have always considered this my personal responsibility, and to ever lose sight of that, is to lose the focus on my sobriety.

So, I am thankful that I have been given the space by those who love me, to figure out what works for me and what doesn‚Äôt.  And I am eternally grateful for that TRUST.  I do not take it lightly.  And once again, a lot of the time, roads end up leading right back to AA principals and the Big Book.  But my independent ass needed to see that for myself.  Got it?

All of the above has brought me to one of my guiding principles. Acceptance.

I practice acceptance daily.

And I have to say that it‚Äôs gotten easier as I‚Äôve become more conscious of what happens throughout the day and become bolder with my actions. I try to be cognizant of what‚Äôs occurring, and therefore make choices that support what I think is right or wrong, positive or negative. This isn‚Äôt necessarily easy, and if I think that‚Äôs ever going to change, I‚Äôm allowing myself to slip right back into my old game, where I expect my feelings and God-given talents to propel me into a life of purpose by destiny alone. It‚Äôs rare that this happens, and when it does, I usually didn‚Äôt have any personal investment. I just got lucky.

Therefore, I accept acceptance as a regular occurrence. Acceptance happens daily, hourly, sometimes minute by minute. What happens next is a choice to move towards something or move away. I am no longer a bystander, waiting for the actions of others or even the existence of things, to determine my fate. I am an active participant who contributes and decides what happens next, for the most part. For me, this realization is so powerful.

‚ÄúGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference.‚Äù

In this way, acceptance is a call to action. And it‚Äôs a realization that we are charged, as human beings, to contribute to life itself, to the goings-on of everything that occurs.

I just decide what to accept, right?

Acceptance usually means asking ourselves what we are going to do about something uninvited. Not necessarily a bad thing, but just being present enough to recognize that this THING is happening in the moment, and we can be a part of it, or not.

The other day, I was in the passenger seat as my 15-year-old son drove us home from camping. I know that this makes me a little nervous, and I know that I handle it much better than I did with his older sister.¬† My acceptance of their growing older has gotten easier, so my own actions have changed.¬† I learned how my controlling reactions affected my daughter, and I try not to repeat those mistakes with him, because it only added to the nervousness of the moment.¬†

During the ride, we had an interesting conversation.  He told me that he had shared a little about me to one of his friends a few months back.  He told him that I was an alcoholic, and his friend seemed very, very surprised.¬† At that point, his friend¬†squoonched up his face, and replied: ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.she always seemed so‚Ä¶.*nice.*‚Äù  My son said that he didn‚Äôt exactly know how to respond to this.¬† He said a few words in response, but didn't exactly argue a case of just how nice I am.¬† He kind of left the conversation at that.  Oh man, that was hard for me to hear. 

See?  But I had to accept that it is not likely that my son knows how to process what happened.  And that he doesn‚Äôt know yet how to handle his friend‚Äôs statement, or even his own personal feelings around this truth-telling and around that label itself.  How would he?  He‚Äôs just learning, just like the rest of us.  So, I had to decide what I would accept about ALL OF THAT in the moment, and how I would respond.  Honestly, I had to think about it awhile, and ended up going to his room later that evening to finish the discussion.  I told him that it‚Äôs possible to accept the feelings of others, that it‚Äôs likely that his friend doesn‚Äôt have any direct experience with alcoholism, and that his reaction and words are merely a reflection of what society has taught him.  That the next time my son is put in this position, he can be careful with his word choice, and that (unfortunately) the word ‚Äúalcoholic‚Äù is a dirty word to the general public which implies immorality...and even the notion that maybe I‚Äôm not ‚Äú*nice*.‚Äù  Ha!  I truly must laugh at it a bit and remind myself that I probably shouldn‚Äôt act overly ‚Äú*nice*‚Äù in my next interaction with this child.  Because he is just that:¬† a child.  I accept that. 

Lastly, I have to say that my acceptance of *sobriety* has truly been a journey.  This one took a while, and please remember‚Ä¶‚Ä¶**it‚Äôs supposed to!**  In a perfect world, it will take a lifetime. 

In the last writing I already referenced Step One.  And if you paid attention, I worked in Steps Two and Three as well. 

Let me explain it this way.

Step One said:  *We admitted we were powerless over alcohol‚Äîthat our lives had become unmanageable.*  (And my soul said: ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I get it man.  You don‚Äôt have to say it again.  I accept that alcohol is an ugly beast for me.‚Äù)

Step Two said:  *Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.*  (My God is a good and loving God, who created me with all that I ever needed.  I just had to realize that it‚Äôs my responsibility to use this power for good.  It‚Äôs called evolution, and it doesn‚Äôt stop happening, but my choices determine where it leads.)

And Step Three:  *Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him*.  (Again, my God created me with all that I need.  Decisions are a CALL to ACTION.  Action Jackson arrived, pushed me over on that bench seat of denial, and started driving that bitch.) 

All three steps are acceptance and courage for me.  I didn‚Äôt necessarily pray to my God to do it for me.  I believed that my God had already given me everything that I needed.  I just needed to get busy and DO something about it.  Perhaps a little maturation needed to happen.  Perhaps I was tired of just letting circumstances roll over me.  But I decided to be active like nobody‚Äôs business.  It was MY business, and I was the entrepreneur of my soul, baby.

This all leads me to another truth telling.....that *true* acceptance of my addictive past and taking on the courage to change didn‚Äôt come until I understood and appreciated what sobriety truly had to offer.  It was just words at first, because I hadn‚Äôt lived it yet.  I had to function from faith, first, but it didn‚Äôt take long to see and feel what was happening and to appreciate and value what was growing within me.  I‚Äôll have to think about how to explain this all, and hopefully I‚Äôll address it in a later post.

It was a little like being given a gift that I never asked for.  Those ‚Äúmost important people in my life‚Äù all went in together on this one, and I didn‚Äôt really know what all was in the box until I started unwrapping the present.  It wasn‚Äôt the prettiest package at first.  It was hand-wrapped in all kinds of strange paper that I never would have chosen myself, but I knew that it came from the heart, right?  And upon seeing its contents, I actually had to put it on and wear it awhile, so their feelings weren‚Äôt hurt. 

But in its wearing, I began to appreciate it‚Ä¶.and then value it. 

Then, I started wearing it when no one was looking at all.

And THEN, I decided that I wanted to wear it everyday, make some myself, and give them to others. Truly amazing!

I hope that I don‚Äôt alienate others by admitting that regular AA meetings are not a part of my weekly schedule.  While fellowship is crucial, I just go about it in my own way at this point.  I always reserve the right to change my mind about what is best for me in the future.  And truth be told, I think about going to meetings often.  I‚Äôm just not as tolerant as I would like to be, regarding finding the right one and appreciating their regularity. 

This is my truth telling, and that must be okay.  Ha!  Or NOT.  YOU decide what you accept.  Maybe someone else will relate to me, begin their own journey, and find that each day is worth it. 

For someone who doesn‚Äôt go to church on a regular basis either, I find great comfort and guidance in the Prayer of St. Francis, and this writing is intended to be an instrument of peace.¬† I hope that my truth telling brings comfort and that my words are used for good.¬†¬†

""Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.""¬†¬†

When I remain present, I know that I have the ability to notice what's around me.¬† And acceptance, courage, and wisdom are only apparent when they are regular practices.

And for me.  They are.

Peace out.  

Love,

Jen"
340,1,"Lately I've been spiraling. Major stress at school, stress at home, financial stress etc.. I've never dealt with sever anxiety as a sober person to this extent (3.5yrs) and I'm starting to panic. 

A couple months ago I butted heads with my sponsor and I've been to maybe 3 meetings since then. Not because of her, because I didnt want to go and things in life were running smoothly.

So now I'm fully aware what I am at risk of losing and I'm back to literally one day and at times one hour at a time trying not to go full panic attack. 

So I set up an appointment to see a therapist. Maybe I need some career redirection, or stress management techniques, or just someone to dump my bullshit on who I dont have a personal relationship with. I set up an appointment with the counseling center at my college.

When I arrive for my appointment I wait 30 minutes after my appointment time to actually see the random therapist that was assigned to me. While I was waiting in that chair I nearly lost it, feelings of hopelessness, anger and exhaustion overwhelming me.

Fast forward. The therapist I ended up spending 30 minutes with has 30 years in recovery (of fucking course he does) he suggests meetings. So I went to a meeting tonight. What are the odds of that? What are the odds that this random ass therapist is in recovery and tells me to get back in the rooms. I cant even right now...."
341,1," 

So, what‚Äôs one of the first decisions that I made in recovery?  Well, I decided to listen.  I knew that others were right about my drinking problem.  They were only confirming what I already knew to be true, that I could not control my drinking and that it was indeed getting worse, causing pain for myself and others around me.  That information came from trusted individuals like Mike, a couple of close friends, my parents, and my children (although they didn‚Äôt know how truly bad it was).   And at last, I didn‚Äôt fight what I was being told.  Truly, that had been a major issue in the past.  If someone told me I should stop, or came at me with judgement or arrogance, OR told me exactly how to do it,¬†*and didn‚Äôt have their side of the street clean*, I did not listen.  Meaning, if I was threatened by someone who I didn‚Äôt trust, their feedback meant nothing to me, and was taken as a reason to continue drinking.  Of course, I know now that this was a ridiculous way to exert my independence, but true nonetheless.  So, their information might have been entirely true about me, but I chose to only see hypocrisy. 

This ‚Äúlistening to trusted individuals‚Äù got me through the door of rehab and continued as I built relationships with counselors there.  I believe it ‚Äú*may‚Äù* have been possible to make this decision to quit drinking without formal treatment‚Ä¶.but looking back, it‚Äôs also possible that the actual *listening*, by my spiritual self, took weeks and even months, instead of minutes.  I don‚Äôt really know.  It‚Äôs not as if these self-realizations came as bolts of lightning with a fortune cookie saying that I could quote.  It‚Äôs a process.  But by going away, I just so happened to increase the likelihood that I was surrounded by these individuals, right?  I mean, I think it was probably a good idea to have very bright and powerful teachers around me everyday for a month.  Who wouldn‚Äôt want that???  And yes, it was a good decision to enter a facility, where I did not even have the option to drink for at least 30 days. 

Upon returning home, I continued to focus on the company I kept and was careful with whose fellowship and whose feedback I took in.  I surrounded myself with the most important people in my life.   I was not demeaned or approached with doubt at every turn.  They did not come at me with anger, punishment or question my resolve.  They came to me with acceptance, love and positivism.  And for an independent soul, this was more than effective, in my case.  And I considered it my responsibility to continue to build relationships that fostered this positivism.  If someone was holding me back from this better part of myself, I kept my distance.  They were not welcomed into my spiritual space, and their feedback, once again, did not hold weight.¬† This wasn't being rude, it was creating boundaries for what would support my recovery.¬† Why do you think I waited 9 months to begin writing like this?¬† There's no way I would have been ready at the beginning of the journey. I learned what to take in healthily, and that has allowed me to decide what I give in return. 

You learn a lot about those around you when you admit to addiction.  Some of that hinges on my own actions, and sometimes it‚Äôs very clear where someone stands in their acceptance and/or encouragement of my recovery.  There are some that won‚Äôt even mention it (and I assume these same people think writing in this way should be embarrassing), as if it‚Äôs too dirty to talk about, or that I‚Äôve now changed just because I admitted my past failures.  This is not fun to endure, but just another part of paying attention to what I‚Äôm being taught.  About people.  And about life.¬† And I have to remind myself that this doesn't mean that *I am dirty*, it is just indicative of what they would like to talk about or acknowledge.¬† But this is sometimes hurtful to me.¬† I work to overcome these feelings daily.

Secondly, I had to define my relationship with alcohol.  I had to take note of what it brought me in the past and decide what role it would have in my life moving forward.  In the 12-Step world, this was really my Step One:¬† ‚ÄúWe admitted we were powerless over alcohol and that our lives had become unmanageable.‚Äù

Let me explain it this way.

I decided that alcohol only hurt me and took me away from my core self, which is good in nature.  And I had to decide what that meant moving forward, because I could not eradicate alcohol, as a substance, from this earth.

I had to choose to redefine the relationship and take back my power. That‚Äôs the irony in Step One, that I admitted I was powerless over a substance, and subsequently took back my power and potential in every other way.  It was clear that *my own actions would determine if I was successful*.  Bottles of bubbly didn‚Äôt hold the power.  And no other person could make this decision for me or commit to the actions that would support this realization.  Only myself.   

Therefore, to put it simply, **I chose to break up with alcohol**.

This was the history.  I had had a long-standing unhealthy relationship with it, that had never served me well, never gave me what I wanted, and only reduced me in many ways.  I mean, it had a great personality and all.  Charming and charismatic.  Sexy as hell, too.  I just got into bed with it one too many times.  You know, like the guy who calls at midnight from the bar, sleeps with you that night, but seems embarrassed about it in the light of day‚Ä¶.leaving you shameful and hurt, and wondering why you let it happen again.

And then he goes on to date one of your friends, treats her well, and is a loving and supportive partner! 

Like that.

In the past, I had invited alcohol into my space and into my body, always with the same results, and I constantly questioned why I liked it so much?!?  It was telling me everything I needed to know about the relationship, but I wasn‚Äôt willing to acknowledge the fact that I just couldn‚Äôt handle what it was willing to offer.  A down and dirty booty call that left me depleted of self after every rendezvous.

Alcohol just wanted in my pants, and I always wanted more. 

So instead of letting IT make the decision, I got to do it this time!!!

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not you, *Alcohol,* it‚Äôs MEEEE!‚Äù

I meant no disrespect, I just had to make a different choice for myself.

Because if I could drink normally, there wouldn‚Äôt be any problem at all.  If I could sleep with it and NOT have my feelings hurt, everyone would have been fine.  But I ain‚Äôt built like that, and I had to accept that.  Because even the first time that I tried alcohol at 16, I did not have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù reaction to it.  I wanted more, each and every time.  And no, that wasn‚Äôt a warning sign.  Not for someone like me.  Because I LIKED it, man.  A lot.  The sex was good.

I like barely-cooked chocolate chip cookies too, and I would find it next to impossible not to eat them if they were warm and gooey and sitting invitingly upon the oven top.  It really is just that simple.  The difference is that if I eat just one cookie, I can likely stop the obsession to eat more.  With alcohol, it‚Äôs not that simple.  Even if I only ingest one glass of frosty Chardonnay, I will want more‚Ä¶.even with my wits seemingly intact.  And I truly don‚Äôt think I have control over that kind of a craving, not once it is in my system. 

Let me expand upon this.  It WAS possible to stop myself after one glass. I did this plenty of times, but it was never easy.  And quite rare, as the years went by.  I found that I was trying to control the craving itself.  Attempting to ignore it.  And unfortunately, it was always a role of the dice.  Maybe I‚Äôd want more in 30 minutes or maybe in a day. 

Remember, it‚Äôs not you, alcohol.  It‚Äôs me.

So this time, *when* ***I*** *did the breaking up*, I took back power and control over my actions.  My choices.  And I clearly defined what I would take in, in the future.  Not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.  I am the master of my domain, and after drawing a physical boundary with booze, I started the more expansive effort to draw boundaries in many other ways. 

I now thoroughly enjoy having my wits about me on a regular basis.  Who knew???  Certainly not me.  Because I‚Äôm a bit of an adventurous spirit, who enjoys being a teensy bit of a risk-taker.  It‚Äôs just interesting to find that I can feel the same way in much healthier situations. Like writing and such.  Again, who knew???  And similarly, I find new ways to calm the inner self.  Like writing, and music, and good food, and long hugs, and listening to people.  Really listening. 

Sobriety is sexy.  We started our relationship with mutual honesty and respect, and the relationship gets deeper and deeper as the commitment grows. I find that I've found what I was looking for all along.¬† Gentle strokes of kindness, overwhelming passion sometimes, holding hands when life is hard.¬† It's all part of what I get when I contribute my full self, and make sure my actions support my better self.¬† I choose the union daily, and I work to maintain the bond that started when I came to the table with everything.  I decided to be **all in** and asked sobriety to take me as I am.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  I can‚Äôt imagine cheating on it, because I value what it brings just as much as I value my love for my husband.  I guess you could say that we‚Äôve got a little m√©nage a trois going.  Me, Mike and Sobriety.  And Mike loves this new bed partner!

These were the first two important realizations, and they have become philosophies that I live by.  To surround yourself with trusted individuals who will speak the truth to you, and to be cognizant of the unhealthy relationships that we have with certain things and with certain people. 

We teach people how to treat us, and so if we are suffering, ***we*** are the only ones who can change that relationship.  For me, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a bottle of Chardonnay or a negative friend.¬† To dance with either¬†represents the denial of my better self. 

Take back your power, baby.  It‚Äôs there for the taking.¬† Ain't nobody going to do it for you.

Just YOU.

Love,

Jen"
343,1," There I sbarely anyone on the other sub, I was hoping to get some advice on this matter:

Currently living in a sober house on long island NY. I have a question or possibly just asking for some advice on this current matter. This is the first sober house I have been to that is actually really clean, there is few people (3 not counting me in a 8 person house), and for the most past everyone seems like they are doing the right thing, working, going to meetings etc. I have been here for about a month, and I notice this sober house differs from others in that they have a rule that you MUST leave from 9am to 4pm monday-friday. This rule is strictly enforced, regardless if its a holiday, if your're sick, have no where to go etc. I want to know is this legal? Someone told me that receives DSS (welfare) that if DSS pays for you to stay somewhere they can fine or make the manger stop doing it since they are not paying for you to live there part time. The rent is slightly more expensive than other houses, at 650 a month, DSS will cover 471 if you apply. This all being said, what are your experiences with the rule have to be out of the house from 9am-4pm monday through friday? On one hand I feel like it's unreasonable on some days, as here in NY it can be raining/snowing during winter months, and I dont think this is exactly legal if DSS is paying for you to live here. However on the other hand I think this rule can be a good thing, it gets us out of the house, to go to meetings, find jobs and develop a healthy routine. Going to a different sober house could be a bad choice since I've been to several on long island and they have all been infested with bed bugs, dirty conditions, thieves and active addicts. This house kicks people out the same day if they steal or use. There are cameras, and I feel a lot safer at this house than every other house I have been to. So what do you guys think? I've tried finding laws on sober houses on long island but Google just tries to relentlessly sell me something or give me articles about how SLEs are messing up the community.

TL/DR: Is it legal for a sober house landlord to make you leave from 9am-4pm monday through friday?"

But that confidence and self-worth is slipping. That feeling of stability is fading away. I haven't relapsed. But I don't feel as good about my recovery.

It's so hard to describe. For awhile there, I just didn't have that self-destructive pull anymore. And now it's back.

350,1,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm Philip 35 years old. I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm in a tough spot. 

5 years ago I went to rehab for oxycodone addiction, I did well and stay away from any kind of substance for 2 and a half years. I started getting a lot bored and decided to try kratom as I read it wasn‚Äôt very addictive and safe. Long story short in 2 years it escalated from 3 doses a week to 4 doses a day. 

Last December I started getting anxiety episodes that have been escalating in intensity, I feel remorseful and I‚Äôm panicking about the smallest things. I‚Äôm an hypochondriac so any little discomfort in my body will trigger an anxiety attack. 

So I decided enough is enough and I‚Äôm tapering the Kratom,I want to be free again. I went from 15 grams per day to five grams per day in a week and haven‚Äôt feel any physical discomfort. The anxiety comes from before the taper so I can‚Äôt blame it to that. I have racing thoughts, start freaking out about everything, nothing logical, nothing real. I was dosing every 5 hours and now I‚Äôm stretching it to every 12-14 hours. 

The thing is I‚Äôm failing at managing my anxiety, I have work and family and I have to be functional all day and this crippling anxiety is making everything so much more difficult. I have been hiding all this shit from my family all this time because specially if my wife finds out I‚Äôm risking losing everything. 

I plan to be totally Kratom free in a couple of months but I need encouragement and tips to manage anxiety. I don‚Äôt know how to stop my mind from freaking out and be calm.  I think I‚Äôm in the right path and in the right mindset to be better and stop consuming Kratom but this doom feeling I have all day and all the guilt is killing me. Please HELP!!!"

352,1,"I‚Äôve gone through so fucking this year trying to get a grip on my addiction and **I did**. I don‚Äôt shoot up anymore, I don‚Äôt take pills to get fucked up, and I don‚Äôt go searching. 

I take my suboxone(prescribed) with gabapentin everyday. I sometimes take benzodiazepines (not prescribed) for work/in general if I‚Äôm feeling anxious. But I **dont** use these drugs to get high. I use them as if I was prescribed and take them accordingly. 

I **genuinely** needed money to get to my job because it‚Äôs overnights and there‚Äôs no buses in the city I live in  after like 7pm because they‚Äôre city funded and not state funded. 

My first pay check is Tuesday and I needed $25, $10 there for the 2 nights  before my check and the $5 for bus money in the morning. 

Fortunately, for me somebody PMed me saying he went through the same and **gave me the $25** and all he asked was that I used it for what I said I needed it, and I am. I‚Äôm not a shitty person. 

This amazing man/women saved my job by giving me this money and doesn‚Äôt even know it. I told him repeatedly how grateful I was towards him and I will forever be grateful. 

But as for the user who told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a drug addict and my post history says I occasionally use that nobody would give me money. Good luck‚Äù along those lines.. pretty much insinuated I would use the money for drugs. 

Fuck you,  man. 

My recovery is **everything** to me. *yes*, I have occasionally used cocaine and some psychedelics. But I‚Äôm not on hanging out around the ‚Äúskid row‚Äù of Boston. I‚Äôm not selling my shit to get high, I‚Äôm not deceiving my loved ones,  haven‚Äôt shot up in months..
**I‚Äôm doing so fucking good**. 

Like I got a JOB. That is **HUGE** for me considering I haven‚Äôt worked in like..  year and a half. That‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve been unemployed. 

I understand the other users reasoning of why he would think because I‚Äôm an addict I would just fuck somebody over, but fuck man. I‚Äôm still a good person. Even in the middle of my addiction I‚Äôve **NEVER** robbed, or ripped anybody off. I may have lied to my family if I was getting high or not but that as far as my deception goes. 

I‚Äôm used to judgement, it comes with openly being an addict but idk why that one comment hurt so much. Maybe because I was genuinely asking for ‚Äúreal world‚Äù help? 

Idk. I‚Äôve just been working so hard in my recovery and it‚Äôs a struggle everyday but I‚Äôm overcoming my demons. I‚Äôm digging deep into what triggers me and the reason I used."

357,1,"Hi guys, I hope you're all doing well. 

So lately I keep dreaming that I'm doing drugs, trying to steal drugs, buying them with someone, etc. And it's been happening pretty much every week lately and it's getting old. I've been serious about my recovery and doing well for a few months now, the best I've ever felt in 12 years or so of addiction.  

Has this been happening to anyone else? How does it affect you? How do you deal with it? 

I kind of wish it just stopped. I'm fortunate to be in a place where I don't get intense cravings or anything from that, but it's frustrating when you're consciously trying to avoid triggers in your daily life just to have your subconscious throw them in your face when you sleep...

They're not even real drugs half the time or my DOCs lol? (Looking at you, that one dream from 3 days ago where I was trying to steal dream!oxycodone-nose-spray-from-a-person-i-didnt-talk-to-in-real-life-for-at-least-15-years??...does that even exist lol?)"

This time of night and trying to find a place where I can just be inside is rough because no matter where I go I feel I'm being judged and scrutinized. But that's just my pride and ego talking.

366,1,"Hey all :). Just thought with I would share my good times to balance out with the bad times that have been posted lately (not criticizing, just wanna share some joy).

I've been sober for over 4 years now (since 08/31/2015) and I've been having a rough time the last couple months, found myself kinda floating thru life like a zombie. So monday, I decided enough was enough.

So, this is day 3 of taking care of me :). So far, I've cleaned my bathroom and kitchen from top to bottom and maintained it, I've worked out every day, I'm getting decent sleep, I'm drinking plenty of water, and I've started working on a new habit: instead of thinking ""great, here we go again"" when things go wrong, I force myself to think ""well, I think it'll get better"" and it's made a huge difference.

Today, i stepped out of my comfort zone (I tend to be a bit of a hermit. Not out of fear or anxiety, just out of being an introvert, in general) and I called my grandma up. She's been hoping to get together for lunch since I moved closer to her house and now we've set up a family dinner day on Sunday at her place and she's just tickled pink that I called to make plans.

I have mental health issues. I'm afraid I won't be able to cope with my depression and anxiety. I don't have many friends and they're far away anyway, and my family's not supportive. I feel so alone, and I'm starting to feel awful.

I‚Äôm getting close to 40 days sober from alcohol and so physical withdrawal should have subsided by now, I‚Äôm guessing now that my sleep problems are completely psychological. I tried breathing techniques and trying to relax, but nothing helps like being just a tad bit sedated. I miss booze but I don‚Äôt miss the suicidal ideation that came with it. 

My therapist hasn‚Äôt been much help. Or maybe I‚Äôm struggling to open up to him... I‚Äôm not sure. 

Welp, they‚Äôre kicking in. One of the few small indulgent pleasures I have left after getting rid of the worst of my vices.

374,1,"Hey all. Recovering alcoholic here. I celebrated 3 years of sobriety earlier this month. Back in 2017 I was in inpatient at the VA hospital in St. Cloud, MN for substance abuse and PTSD. They had this painting there of a man sitting on the curb outside a bar. He was inside of a liquor bottle and his wife and young daughter standing off to the side with this sad hopeless look. It kind of represented the the pain and isolation not only the man felt but the effect of his alcoholism on them. Anyway, looked at this for like 4 months everyday. I really connected with it, as I was divorced as a result of my alcoholism and I have a young daughter. I think about it often and have been trying to find it for a while now with no luck. Hoping someone out there might be familiar with it and could give me the name of it or the artist. I wanna say it was a woman that signed it with two initials and a last name EXAMPLE (  A.B. Artist). Thanks guys."

380,1,"Sex for me has changed a bit since I got clean. I just feel so dirty about it. Not in an ashamed way but in the sense that it makes me feel dirty. Like I need to shower. When I was using meth it killed my entire sex drive and when I did have sex while on it, I felt awkward like I wasn't sure what to do with myself. I was very promiscuous over the years I was using, but even before drugs I had a decent sex drive and felt fine engaging in sex and masturbating. Now it's all kinda weird to me. Sometimes I even feel guilty and hate myself for masturbating. I'm just trying to figure out where all this is stemming from so I can find a way to fix it."

&amp;#x200B;

Swim has struggled with vices for the past 10 years. Swim has lived veiled behind the shadow of substances - both legal and illegal. It has taken a toll on swim's life, physical presentation, physical wellbeing, and mental health. Swim has made many attempts to quit substances without success. Swim has a job and, for the most part , is a fully functioning individual. However, swim needs to learn to live sober. 

Recently with great effort, swim has limited their substance intake drastically. Swim only uses marijuana (legal edibles), tea, alcohol, and the occasional anti-anxiety medication. The marijuana intake is drastically greater than the other substances listed. Swim has reached a place that they never thought that they would reach. 

Swim is ready to quit all substances cold turkey. Swim believes there will absolutely be no physical side-effects on their body. 

**Here is the trouble:** Swim needs tips for that extra reminder in the morning. How do you guys remind yourselves to stay sober. How do you remind yourselves of those moments when you are using and tell yourself, ""I will never use again""? Any advice you can provide will be greatly appreciated and passed along to swm.

Thanks!!!!!"

At every meeting I‚Äôve ever been to, the last 5 minutes you celebrate those who are celebrating a chip. Apparently here, nope. They give chips out once a week and it wasn‚Äôt today.  When I politely asked after the meeting if I could pick my chip up, they acted like they were better than me and were horrified I‚Äôd even ask. 

So fuck today and fuck that meeting. I bought my own chip off amazon and asked my wife if she‚Äôll give it to me tomorrow.

I'm struggling hard right now. Tonight. This hour. 
This week. This month. Last month. Last semester. 

I started University last September after multiple years working hard at community college. Nearly a full scholarship based on amazing grades. Within a month of this massive change, a Right of Way Specialist was sitting in my living room assessing my family's needs. 

My extended family was selling the property I lived on, as a renter, to the city. 

A Right of Way Specialist is a nice title for a nasty job. Someone has to do. I guess. 

I also have been diagnosed with ASD, PTSD, and Anxiety in the last year. Prior to this... I carried the wrong diagnoses which prescribed me the wrong meds, and made life really messed up for about 10 years.

I've wanted to use almost every day since the ROW assessed my family and told me i had to move. This made studying at University harder..it created a larger strain on my marriage, and also shattered pur son's world.

I know I cant use. Using would shatter everyone's world..mine first. 

I've been to four meetings in 3 weeks. I never liked meetings at the beginning of my sobriety. I felt unwanted, outcasted. I got myself a sponsor. And I'm working the program.

I don't remember sober being this hard..

Urge here..urge there. Today I even had an urge to self injure, that hasn't happened in over 16 years. It made my skin crawl. 

I've bored my spouse to death talking. My sponsor has a sickness. And my two friends aren't available..

I don't want to go to sleep, because I'll wake up and feel the same or worse."
386,1,"Hi room:

I'm celebrating 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from alcohol and addictive sex/love behaviors!!! What a fucking miracle that I am alive, want to be alive, and am living sober.

I'm speaking in one of my communities which requests scripts (because of online medium) and I thought I'd share it here for anyone who is interested... It's focused on sex/love but, eh, I think one addictive banana is just a part of the whole bunch. And it's 12-step focused. That's definitely not the only path and it's not even my only path (I also like Buddhist recovery and I've benefited from a generous helping of medical assistance) but, it's the speaker share I wrote, so I'd love to share it with y'all. 

I wish everyone a contented sober day with enough pain to want to change and enough courage to get it done. 

xo

\-

With a lot of joy, a little disbelief, and tremendous gratitude, I celebrated 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from sex and love addiction two days ago. (My sobriety date is January 13, 2016.) I will use the typical 12 step speaker format of what it was like, what happened, and what it‚Äôs like now. I would also like to suggest not only to the newcomer, but also to the old-timer, and everyone in between, to practice open-mindedness in listening today. With any story‚Äîwhether I participated in those behaviors and thoughts or didn‚Äôt‚Äîthere will be things that I can relate with and things that I cannot. It is my responsibility to find the commonality, take what I can for today, and leave the rest to think about later. 

So, about me, and what happened. I had a challenging childhood. I believe two early attachment ruptures contributed to my addiction. I also believe my paternal genetic lineage of mental illness, alcoholism, and completed suicide contributed to my addiction. In short, by the time I was about 7, the slingshot of addiction was loaded and pulled back. So I‚Äôm 7 and I start having ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù. The difference between my ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù and those of my classmates was, I believe, my obsession and the feeling in my chest of wanting to be loved and consumed, even from a young age. I remember once being in the car having broken up with one 7-year-old ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI am so free now! I can do what I want!‚Äù Love addict early on. From 7 to 12 I was having these non-sexual but fantasized-about boyfriends in school and on the bus and on the street. At 12 I discovered my first drug: my asthma inhaler. I also discovered lying. I did not tell my parents why I needed so many inhalers‚Äîpracticing addicts are remarkably selfish and I did not care that they were expensive, but of course I was also a child without much ability to take perspective‚ÄîI just lied that they went off randomly in my backpack. I discovered my first drug and I also started drinking. 

So now I‚Äôm 13 and I have discovered drugs, alcohol, and ‚Äúolder boys‚Äù, which leads me to my first real sexual experience while drinking straight, cheap vodka from water bottles at a public swimming pool with an older boy. I had both the ‚Äúsex‚Äù and ‚Äúlove‚Äù aspects of sex and love addiction, though they would eventually intertwine.  When I was 14 I was in a relationship with a boy whom I fantasized that I would marry and I had sex for the first time‚Äîhe was 4 years my senior. When I was 15 he ‚Äúghosted me‚Äù and I could not understand, I called him obsessively, and this obsessive calling became a hallmark feature of my love addiction. At about age 15 I began running, playing sports, and engaging in bulimia (purging and exercise). Now the trifecta had come to fruition and that addiction slingshot‚Äîwhich had been loaded and pulled back from a young age‚Äîfired, with no undo button. 

So here‚Äôs the addictive trifecta for me: boys, booze, bulimia. I wanted love, I would go out on weekends as a teenager, drink to blackout, which lessened my shame, helped my social anxiety, and allowed me to do things I was otherwise ashamed of. I would wake up, obsess about the guy(s) from before, they would naturally not care, and then I would binge and purge to make myself feel better. I would feel fat, and need a partner to ""love"" me, and tell me I was pretty. I used physical sex as a placeholder for love and being told I‚Äôm pretty. So the next time I could, I would do the cycle again. And this occurred from ages 15 ‚Äì 26. 

Within that timeframe I had many accomplishments: graduating high school with honors, year-long relationships, graduating college summa cum laude, working at a highly prestigious university... I also had many challenges: several medical withdrawals, growing suicidality as part of bipolar disorder, social isolation, constant misery, liver malfunction, incurable STI‚Äôs (two of them), online and camera acting out, unbearable shame, panic attacks every day towards the end. I always felt like I was not enough, or worse, I was too much, annoying, and you were going to leave me, and then I would die. I had no friends. 

By this point I‚Äôm 26 and I am ready to end my life because to continue in this way is futile. I had yet another blackout night culminating in a dehumanizing one-night-stand.Mind you‚ÄîI joined 12 step programs when I was 19 (food related) then 20 (alcohol) then 24 (SLAA) so I was convinced that nothing would work for me. I had already tried sponsors, the steps, I couldn‚Äôt stay sober to save my life (literally), and I was ready to die. I was so low that the only reason I didn‚Äôt enact my plan was it would halt public transportation, and I didn‚Äôt want my death to ruin anyone‚Äôs work commute. I called my psychiatrist because I trusted her, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. On January 13, 2016 she met me at the hospital and had me admitted into a dual-diagnosis unit. That means I am formally diagnosed with addiction and mental illness. Here I was well-medicated and a straight-shooting nurse told me, 

‚ÄúIf you drink, you will die.‚Äù 

I said , ""No no no you don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôve already done AA, I‚Äôve already done all this stuff, it doesn‚Äôt work.""

She replied,  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you do or don‚Äôt do, you just can‚Äôt drink.‚Äù 

So I spent two weeks in this dual-diagnosis unit where I engaged in intrigue with other patients. I decided to stop drinking alcohol through self-will and would fix my life through becoming the perfect worker, the perfect employee,  and would work myself into a better life. Three months later I‚Äôm at my next psychiatric ward, again suicidal. Those three months of intensive professional work and white-knuckle sobriety (alcohol and sex and love) did not fix the fundamental problem which for me I believe is existential, spiritual‚Ä¶ I believe my fundamental problem is NOT that I act out, or that I have the wrong partner, or that I don‚Äôt have a partner, or that the sex isn‚Äôt this way, or that I'm not loved the right way‚Ä¶ I believe my fundamental problem is that I have a god-shaped hole in my chest  that I try to shove full of addictive content, but it will never feel whole and full that way and it will continue consuming and consuming until I give it the right sustenance, which is connection.

So after my second psychiatric ward stay  I realized inwardly what it says in the book Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as the Big Book) that I was ‚Äúunable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it‚Äù (pg. 165). I tried drinking and grabbing at love which landed me in the psych ward. I tried abstaining which landed me in the psych ward. I realized that, as the Big Book says on that same page, the fellowship of the spirit was what would bring me contentment, joy, and meaning. At this point I became deadly serious about surrender. 

The basics of early recovery for me included: no-contact with men (more than 6 months), no relationships (about one year), daily meetings and stepwork. The basic purpose of not talking to men has nothing to do with gender or gender identity. It is that I needed to stop using sex, flirtation, and intrigue as social currency. With women, I had to be a real person to find friendship and camaraderie, and so I developed a community of women. ‚ÄúTime takes time‚Äù is a wonderful motto. I took this time in early recovery to stabilize myself physically, to orient myself as a 12-stepper, and to dig deep into spiritual reflection through stepwork. I have had many wonderful sponsors over time. The worst of my sponsors told me what to do and tried to control me. I now know, this is totally natural for an addict to do,  but it is not the way to a spiritual awakening. The best of my sponsors taught me to take inventory, trust, pray, meditate, and practice selfless service. They put my hand into the god-hand. The best of my sponsors used the Basic Text and Big Book to lift me up towards god, rather than to beat me down into a false humility. Ultimately I did find more and more of what I wanted in recovery: the dignity of choice, open-minded and curious spiritual exploration, freedom from addiction. Most of all I grew over time to authentically love myself. 

I  love this line from our SLAA Basic Text at the end of Chapter 5, The Withdrawal Experience: ‚ÄúAmidst all difficulties and uncertainties, a simple intimacy had come into being for us: we had met ourselves, and found ourselves worthy. We had become ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù to ourselves.‚Äù 

When I was in my addiction, I could not fathom finding myself worthy. I had a whole host of bad names for myself and reasons why I wasn‚Äôt acceptable, which fueled my need to find another person to tell me I was acceptable,  and to pump that god-shaped hole in my heart full of addictive garbage. I wasn‚Äôt worth it, so why would I care?  Yet, today, I am worth it, and I have internalized the love so freely given me in SLAA and other 12-step rooms.  

To the newcomer who wants a suggestion‚ÄîI suggest identifying people with whom you won‚Äôt use sex and social currency, and developing recovery community with them based in honesty and integrity. I suggest working the steps over and over and over again: ‚Äútime takes time‚Äù and these spiritual lessons are not quick to learn. I suggest staying sober, because if you can relate with me...you probably need it to stay alive. On the practical topic of bottom lines, each of us will have our own, so I'll share about just my main one: I don‚Äôt practice infidelity. Infidelity is any behavior which I would not do in front of my partner (from sex to secret messages to long hugs). To my inner addict,  that is a radical, impossible standard! But it is possible in recovery.

Today I am sober from bottom lines in SLAA, alcohol and related substances in AA for 4 years. I have an amazing romantic partner, we are planning a life together. I have a cat who has never seen me drink! :D I am close with my family. I am still reactive, angry, and selfish‚Äîbut not nearly as much and not nearly as frequently. I have faith. I am special, but not unique. What a fun freedom: to love myself without narcissism, to love you without abandoning myself. The freedom of recovery is yours, too, should you choose to pursue it. 

Remember to pause to hear the quiet voice of god. Find your recovery tribe‚Äîstay in the middle of the herd.   Quit filling the god-shaped hole with garbage, one day at a time. You deserve better, I know it even if you're not sure yet. Start filling yourself with faith as you understand faith. You can find it taking the 12 steps. And, for you and for me,  more will be revealed."
387,1,"I live in a rural area of MI, and I‚Äôm trying to hit some cities for AA meetings. I‚Äôm 24/trans (ftm) and all of the people I seem to meet at meetings are old guys. The only people I have clicked with are too new to sponsor. Ideally my sponsor would be lgbt friendly and I could check in with them every day. Any advice for finding that?"
389,1,"Toddlers and drunk people are the same. They both dribble, fall over and shit their pants. They do bad dancing and vomit. They even pass out and wake up in places they've never been before. Just like I used to. There is one main difference, adults (are supposed to) take care of themselves whereas babies rely on parents to take care of them. Alcohol gets in the way of that rule.

When I turned 18 I was in the midst of my heavy binge drinking, I was an adult, expected to be responsible, expected to stay safe. But I did the opposite. I drank to access, I gave up my body and my safety when under the influence, I acted out because my inhibitions were flushed down the toilet along with a shot of vodka. I behaved like a child.

It's a fallacy that losing your inhibitions is a good thing. It's total rubbish. For me it meant losing my ability to make wise decisions. It meant not caring about myself.

I thought it was funny at the time, I laughed off the overwhelming regret the next day over Bloody Mary's at the pub. Honestly, I liked being the one with the most outrageous stories, it was a role I carved out for myself, the funny one, the stayer upper, the party girl. I was so busy adhering to the role that I never checked in to find out who was really benefiting from my hilarity, I never stopped to think... is this ok? and somewhere between the punch lines, I forgot that I mattered.

Someone told me once that we stay the same age as when we started drinking until we stop, we don't give our bodies a chance to develop, we block evolution somehow. I believe this. I've experienced it.

When I stopped alcohol 18 months ago it felt as if I could suddenly see more clearly, my mistakes became visible. My behaviour when drunk seemed unimaginable. How could I have thought sleeping with strangers was funny? taking drugs and falling over was a joke? How had I let myself become that wild girl and who was she?

I really didn't know her.

With a new clearer mind, I felt myself grow. day by day the child developed, I could feel all the black holes that I used to disappear into fill up with something more tangible. I was getting aquatinted with me for the first time. not a performer, the true me.

I started drinking when I was 13, I'm 42 now. I had a lot of catching up to do with this girl...

this woman.

Quitting booze made me grow up and realise that I mattered. It made me determined to make sure my kids didn't see that sort of behaviour, I didn't want to give them a message that not taking care of yourself was ok. The only way to show them was to break the cycle of binge drinking. Teach them that an adult acting out like a toddler is wrong and dangerous.

I don't know if this will work? I will have to write a post on here in ten years and let you know if they're calling me from university or a jail cell. But at least I'm being a positive influence over them rather than asking them to bring a glass of orange juice from a darkened room.

The lesson is - be an adult, grow up and stop being someone for everyone else.

Just be you. The real you. I did and it's wonderful.

Note - Toddlers definitely shit themselves more than drunk people.

I think I only have once, after glugging down prune juice in a drunken stupor... but let's not talk about how many times I pissed my pants when out drinking. I should have worn nappies!"
390,1,"I relapsed again this week. Twice. Two huge days of drinking and being an embarrassment to myself. 

I‚Äôve restarted my count and am on Day 1 again as of today after a miserable day of hangover and still being intoxicated yesterday. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I feel worthless and like it would have been better if I‚Äôd drunk myself to death this time."

## STARTING OVER

by [Jarrod Phillips and Jeremy Kartchner](https://www.utahbusiness.com/author/jarrodphillips/) [June 10, 2019](https://www.utahbusiness.com/2019/06/)  

**I‚Äôve been fortunate to produce, co-produce, or associate produce 11 cable Christmas movies, most of them for Crown Media‚Äôs Hallmark Channel. These movies follow a familiar formula and are universally adored by their devoted fans. They are fun, lighthearted, and always promote a sense of happiness and wellbeing.**

**So how did an ex-Mormon and recovering addict start producing Christmas Movies for cable networks? Here‚Äôs my story.**

## MY ROAD TO ROCK BOTTOM

**My family joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints not long after I was born. My father held a position of responsibility as city manager in Vail, Colorado, and was the president of his branch there, but I always sensed religious life wasn‚Äôt for me.**

**Then in my early 20s, I found myself at a crossroads. I was married with a young son, and working my first job as a manager of business development in Orem, Utah. The work was fun, educational, and my ideas were valued. But I also felt out of place. Traveling and entertaining were part of the job, and I constantly found myself awkwardly declining drinks at work functions. Eventually, I gave in. I started drinking at the age of 25 and wouldn‚Äôt stop completely until the age of 44.**

**We moved to Los Angeles where I took a job at House of Moves Motion Capture Studios. We had another child, a daughter, and adapted to life in Southern California. But it was there that I felt as though I‚Äôd found my secret weapon: alcohol. Alcohol helped me avoid difficult feelings and feel charming in social situations. I also got into smoking cigarettes.**

**Eventually, I developed a cocaine habit. Over the course of several years, I sold my marriage and my children for fractions of ounces of blow. My drinking and drug use took over my life and my work. My employer very kindly asked me to leave and even offered to pay for treatment, but I demurred, denying there was a problem. I thought I had hit rock bottom, but it was only the beginning.**

**At that point, I left Los Angeles in 2005 and moved back in with my parents. Around the same time, the movie ‚ÄúFailure to Launch‚Äù was released. In it, a man in his thirties was still living with his parents. That situation was the crux of the comedy in the film, but nothing about my own situation seemed funny. During my first three months in Colorado, I managed to get another DUI‚Äïmy second arrest‚Äïand almost totaled my car in the process.**

**I had run out of options. I figured that I was either going to die or end up in jail unless I made a substantial life change. Though I was able to kick my cocaine habit, I was scared to give up alcohol. By that point, I felt like I had no idea how to live without it. I attended AA on and off, but my attempts to quit were very short lived.**

**I was clear enough for brief periods to see that my life was not moving in the direction I wanted. But those periods didn‚Äôt last. Things continued to get worse until I attempted to kill myself, several times. I passed through the darkest nights my soul has ever seen, I felt like such a burden to everyone I knew, and I was disgusted with myself. Thankfully, I made it through those nights, and I‚Äôm grateful every day that I get to be alive.**

## MY CLIMB TO THE TOP

**Finally, in 2007, a friend introduced me to a company called Impact Trainings in Bluffdale, Utah. Created in 1985 by founders Hans and Sally Berger, Impact has assisted thousands of people‚Äïincluding me‚Äïto break down those emotional walls that keep us from fully experiencing life. Impact was the first place I realized I had been slowly and methodically shutting everyone out of my life.**

**There, I was able to rediscover who I am‚Äïpowerful, loving, inspiring, and passionate‚Äïand I began to love myself again. I began to trust others and grew less afraid to ask for assistance. This started me on the path of pulling myself out of the morass into which I had planted myself and helped me set a new tone for my life, one of kindness and love.**

**As a result, my relationships with my kids and family started improving, and slowly, but surely, I began to regain the trust of the people I worked with. I started hugging everyone I met‚Äïeven in business settings, with their permission of course. My hugging ways have since earned me the nickname ‚Äúthe hugger.‚Äù I found my heart again and finally felt the courage to share it authentically.**

**In 2010, after another marriage‚Äïand subsequent divorce‚ÄïI decided to start acting again. It was one of my dream jobs growing up, and I figured that, after a lifetime of doing what everyone else thought I should do, I had everything to gain by finally going for it. My acting teacher, Rob Diamond, encouraged me to get an agent, helped me secure my first film acting gigs, and supported me to get started and to stay consistent. I have since had the opportunity to act in more than 23 films and shorts, including ‚ÄúPunk‚Äôs Dead, SLC Punk 2,‚Äù and last year‚Äôs horror breakout hit, ‚ÄúHereditary.‚Äù**

**I was willing to do whatever it took to stay working and to learn the ropes of the film industry. After my marketing assistance on a film called ‚ÄúChick Magnets‚Äù helped sell out its premiere, I received some local attention and was invited to help produce ‚ÄúFriend Request‚Äù starring Anthony Michael Hall in 2012. After that first film, I produced with Jason Falasco, Brad Johnson, and Mario DeAngelis; I took some gigs as a location manager, and I acted in just about anything willing to cast me. Seeing others doing what I wanted to do was extremely motivating and my commitment to producing started paying off when I began to be hired to produce small films such as ‚ÄúInspired Guns,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Christmas Project,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äôs Warrior.‚Äù**

**Eventually, I was cast in a Hallmark Christmas movie called ‚ÄúChristmasland.‚Äù While on set, I met my friend and mentor, Brian Nolan. Mr. Nolan would go on to hire me first as a location manager, and then to recommend me to Mar Vista Entertainment to produce my first Hallmark movie, ‚ÄúMy Christmas Love‚Äù in 2016. Mr. Nolan has since hired me several times to be his associate producer and unit production manager as has another friend and mentor, Markus Bishop-Hill.**

## IT‚ÄôS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN

**Knowing what it‚Äôs like to have nothing has been incredibly liberating and powerful‚Äïnot to mention extremely motivating. Until I lost everything, it was impossible for me to understand the concept. I have often said to myself: If I can survive bankruptcy, multiple divorces, more than one sudden and complete loss of income, foreclosure, and several suicide attempts then there is strength and power to support me and that‚Äôs something I will always be grateful for.**

**Quitting, or wanting to give up, when things aren‚Äôt going my way has often seemed like the easy choice, but ultimately continuing to persevere in the face of difficulty has taught me lessons I could have never learned any other way. When I finally started to let myself slow down, get still, adapt, and acquire patience I began to understand what Leo Tolstoy meant when he said, ‚Äúthe two most powerful warriors are patience and time.‚Äù**

**I now have the confidence that if I were to lose it all again, I could bounce back. That confidence is empowering and provides an attitude that leads to success. I now get to enjoy a life that is overwhelmingly in the positive. I have supportive parents, siblings, and close friends who have assisted me along the way. My son, Nick is a computer software engineer with a degree from UC Davis and is engaged to be married this October. My daughter, Katie is a talented artist, writer, and dedicated student. Both live in Northern California and there are few things in my life that make me as proud as being their dad.**

**My wife, Melissa is the most supportive, kind, loving, and forgiving partner. Having her believe in me has made all the difference, and I am deeply deeply grateful to her. Having her, and her two kids, Mae and Sawyer in my life reminds me of Marianne Williamson‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúJoy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are.‚Äù**

**My wife, Melissa Mae (phenomenal artist, Insta: HeyMelissaMae) and I now work together in Farmington, Utah, where we have the good fortune of working on projects that are fun, lighthearted, and always promote a sense of happiness and wellbeing. My life may not have been like Hallmark Christmas movie, but I‚Äôm so grateful for all of it.**"
393,1,"I‚Äôm almost 90 days clean. I recently left treatment and mover into a sober living home. I‚Äôve been here for about a month and everything was going well up until the last week or so.

He really has nothing to complain about when it comes to me and my sobriety/ responsibility. But he repeatedly is up my ass about the littlest things, more so than anyone else in the house.

My parents also won‚Äôt help me (I‚Äôm 20) because ultimately I put myself in this situation, and I can‚Äôt blame them for that at all. My only option besides this house is to go to the homeless shelter and lose my job. Which I‚Äôm honestly willing to do if I really don‚Äôt have any other option. But I know if I go to the shelter I‚Äôm gonna give up and get high again. Does anyone have any advice for me? I‚Äôm really struggling right now and would greatly appreciate it"

397,1,"Over the holidays I ended up having some drinks at Christmas parties and I‚Äôve been relapsing ever since. No one knew about it at first, but now people can see I‚Äôm behaving strangely and can‚Äôt pinpoint why. 

The two times I‚Äôve been most likely to drink is at work or when my wife isn‚Äôt home. At first it was the half pint of vodka in the water bottle routine and chase it with coke. But now my tolerance has grown and it‚Äôs turned into a full pint. The problem is, I‚Äôm smaller sized and the pint really starts to mess me up. I can‚Äôt even remember the end of work or large chunks of when I got home.

Work was the original trigger, and I didn‚Äôt have a drinking problem before I started this career. Ironically, I was a fucking bartender and never drank anywhere close to how I do now. I‚Äôve taken steps to leave me career and only have about 3 more months left before I can transition into my new career. I just want the urge to say drink when my wife isn‚Äôt home and to get plastered at work to all go away for good."

399,1,I spent two months in a mental health and addiction treatment center. I‚Äôve been alone my whole life no friends nothing even close to a girlfriend. I met a girl there and we talked for the first time I actually connected with someone and had someone care about me and she said she had romantic feelings for me. I left and so did she and we talked on the phone hours a day every day for a couple months then things just stopped and I kept texting her like a fucking idiot and I should‚Äôve known that as soon as I opened myself up to someone they‚Äôd hate what they. Saw but still I tried to keep in contact with her. For a couple weeks it was me initiating everything then I realized what a fucking idiot I was being and called her and asked her if she still wanted to keep talking to me and she said she didn‚Äôt care and I asked if I‚Äôve had a positive or negative impact on her because all I want to fucking do is have a positive impact on people and she said I had no impact on her and that she was back with her ex. I‚Äôm so so fucking stupid to think that I could ever have a connection with anybody I‚Äôm a stupid fucking junkie piece of shit addict and I should‚Äôve killed myself when I was 14 and first tried. I‚Äôm fucking drunk and I want to blow my head off so goddamn bad. What the fuck is wrong with me. I‚Äôm shit at writing and I‚Äôm shit at everything and I genuinely believe everything would be better without me. And I don‚Äôt write this for sympathy or for anyone to tell me I‚Äôm a good person none of you know me and I‚Äôm not I‚Äôm a fucking horrible person. I don‚Äôt even know why I write this. I‚Äôm a burden to others and I always will be and not I‚Äôm just sitting watching naked lunch trying to hold myself back from taping my mouth to a cars exhaust for the sake of my family but that‚Äôs all I want to do right now. And now I‚Äôll probably bum a bunch of people out with this post. That‚Äôs all I can fucking do is have a negative impact on people and I‚Äôm as fucked as fucked can be and I‚Äôm just so goddamn ready to be done with life and call it a fucking day. I hate myself more than I can ever even express and everyone I come in contact with has the right to hate me too. I‚Äôm so fucked. And I‚Äôm not even going to kill myself over this person so I don‚Äôt want that to be taken that way I‚Äôm going to kill myself over the implications that this has on my future. I‚Äôll never be able to connect or positively impact anyone. I‚Äôm fucked And I hate myself for being so selfish and inhuman. I‚Äôm so fucking done with this. I‚Äôm completely fucked and no one can help me and I can‚Äôt help anyone and I really really can‚Äôt handle 60 or whatever more years of this

402,1,"Hey y‚Äôall !

I can‚Äôt help myself from having these uncontrollable spouts of jealousy when my girlfriend is somewhere that she may end up drinking. The jealousy can also turn into me being dry toward her while she‚Äôs there or to even completely ignore her. I sometimes get very angry too, but try hard not to express it in our text conversations. 

Her and I have tried to find a good way to go about the situation. I‚Äôm completely honest with her and tell her how jealous it makes me knowing she‚Äôs going to drink. We‚Äôve tried several different things. One way is she will warn me before going that she may be drinking and that it‚Äôs best we don‚Äôt communicate. Another way is we don‚Äôt say anything, and if she ends up drinking she tries to talk to me less. Anyway we‚Äôve tried I still end up getting the exact same feelings of jealousy. 

I have 10 months sober now. Sometimes it makes me wonder why I still am like this. I have no desire to drink or use. But knowing that the person I love the most is going to be doing something that was my favorite thing ever to do, makes me livid. 

She‚Äôll be drinking this weekend and the jealousy has taken over today. Not sure if anyone has experienced this or something like it. If anyone has words please share. Thank you!"
403,1,"I will have 7 years clean from drugs in NA on March 5th. This wisdom is my first surgery I've had to have. I told the doctor of my addiction during the consultation. He explained to me that he would recommend sedation with the way my teeth are (I have waited a long time to do this they are grown sideways), and the sedation he will use is Fentanyl and Versed. Immediately my stomach dropped. 

He did clarify that he uses this cocktail on many people in recovery for sedation but does not provide take home doses. That gave me some relief but I'm just scared.

Does anyone here have any experience? If I am put under will I feel high or just asleep? If I'm asleep will my mental symptoms of addiction be triggered/will I be craving again? I'm going to tell my support group and sponsor as well but posted here in hopes of getting an influx of answers."

Therapy has helped a lot with getting to the root of my stuff and feeling more in control of my actions. I've processed a lot of trauma and I can tell I'm generally healthier and happier than I have been my entire life. But something is still... off. 

I've been thinking maybe I need to see a psychiatrist on top of my therapist because it seems like there's something more going on. I have the coping skills, I've processed the trauma, and I'm still not as stable as I'd like to be. 

But I'm afraid of the meds. On one hand, I'm afraid of being prescribed anything I can abuse. I don't trust myself not to and even if I tell the dr that upfront I don't trust them to truly understand. But on the other hand, I feel like I could really benefit from meds. 

Anyone have experience navigating psychiatric meds while in recovery? Advice would be appreciated."

409,1,"When I was little my Dad took me to London Zoo. I walked through big Art Deco gates, holding his hand, I was wearing a duffle coat like Paddington Bear and my ruby red mittens hung below my cold hands from a string that looped all the way around my back. I could see the heads of giraffes munching leaves and hear the roar of a lion in the distance. We approached the chimp enclosure, languid apes sat slouched over logs picking at each other‚Äôs ball bags. There was a huge sign on the fence that stated very clearly,

‚ÄòDo Not Feed the Animals‚Äô

Dad got a packet of Chewits out of his shirt top pocket, undid the sticky wrapper and chucked one into the cage. He had that cheeky grin across his face,

‚ÄòWatch this kids‚Äô

The ape picked up the sweet and threw it into its mouth. It started chewing, a lot.

Then a sound resonated around the zoo,

‚Äòkaa, kaaaa, kaaaaaaa‚Äô

The monkey was choking. Its eyes protruded from the sockets like the top of hard-boiled eggs. The Chewit lodged in its throat.

‚Äòkaaaaaaahhh‚Äô

Dad‚Äôs expression swiftly changed to total panic,

‚ÄòTime to go kids‚Äô

He had not moved that fast since he won the 400m dash at the Surrey track and field championships in 1953. We were shoved out of the ornate gates, into the car and were on the M4 heading home before morning tea. I hoped the chimp didn't die, I imagined it swallowing the sweet and then finding the packet and finishing them off. Even if he had nearly karked it, it was worth it for those few juicy moments. Animals are funny like that, not thinking things through, repeating the same old stupid behaviours.

Thinking about that story now I realise that I am that chimp! - I have been my whole life - An out of control ape grabbing at a substance that I know will make me sick, pushing through crowds to get to the bar before closing time in order to throw a shot down my neck, choking out the kebab I devoured just hours before. Even if I felt like death afterwards, hungover: knowing alcohol was destroying me, my hand would still be reaching out for another dose, desperately grabbing, wanting more, as soon as the storm had passed.

'Hair of the dog anyone?'

I'm in.

I remember reading a book about giving up smoking that described being addicted to nicotine as like having a monkey on your back that you were constantly trying to keep happy by feeding it bananas. I can relate to this analogy. The monkey is annoying, yes... but we are friends, I don't mind him living on my back, picking at my nits. If I'm bored we can get up to mischief together; smoke cigars and reminisce about jungle music. He's a reliable buddy and to be honest, I don't mind his red bulbous bottom, it's impressive and very shiny.

I finished the book and stopped smoking. Refusing to feed my furry beast for about 24 hours.... then he got hungry. He scratched me, nudged me and chatted in my ear so I gave in, gave him what he wanted, anyway, I didn't want to cause us to fall out, I was used to having him around. He knows me and I trust him.

I am exactly the same with booze. No matter how good my intentions I couldn't help but feed my habit.

I didn't have the tools or support to stop. Where was my monkey friend when I needed him? Fact was, I needed something new and I needed help.

I didn't have the tools or support to stop. Where was my monkey friend when I needed him? The fact was, I needed something new and I needed help.ack, all day every day. A burden that was affecting my life, ruining it instead of doing what it promised. The disco lights had faded and all that was left on the dance floor was some fag butts and the heel of my shoe. The flirty dancing was gone and the lights were exposing all of my flaws. I was a mess. Drinking had taken its toll and that big gorilla was slowly weighing me down. Eventually, I had to put him down, no, not euthanise him! Geez!, he was just fucking heavy!

Putting down the drink and saying goodbye to my best friend was the hardest yet most rewarding accomplishment of my life. I didn't need him anymore. I missed him, I still do... but our relationship had turned toxic and his breath was repugnant. I set him down and wished him well. His body swayed and his knuckles dragged on the floor as he disappeared over the horizon...

410,1,"# Being stuck between the Pub and AA

That sums me up, 7 words. Years of back and forth, drinking and not drinking. From dry Julys and sober Octobers to pissed up Christmas's and last man standing (if wonkily) at any social event. I'm a never-ending hangover that knows she can do better.

Having popped out a few brats in recent years has had me questioning my behaviour. Am I someone who gets a tincy wincy bit wasted every now and again or am I an Alcoholic? I'm going to write this blog to find out more about me and people like me. Stuck in a pissed up purgatory, not brave enough to reach out for help and not stupid enough to know there is a problem.

You see...My drinking is socially acceptable, people think I'm fun. You wouldn't pick me out as a total alcoholic in need of intervention because my drinking is absorbed into everyone else's. it's diluted like vodka in orange juice, it's disguised as yummy and extrovert, like a happy fruit punch at a free bar (the only punch I ever got from it was from a dodgy ex-boyfriend) Diluting my problem amongst the crowd meant I  got away with it. it was soaked up into my friend's soggy minor alcohol addictions, making it disappear ...Puff! No questions asked. 

Sundays were  filled with sly comments from friends, hilarious jibes that were laughed off over a bloody Marys, things like,

'she likes a drink that one' or

'you looked like you were having fun last night'

'who was that guy with his tongue in your ear hole?'

'Why are you wearing a sombrero?

All  translate into the same meaning...

'you were fucking wasted and I am better than you because I remember everything!'

Self-righteous bastards -  remember a night out - how boring!

Then I started to wonder why all the funny anecdotes were always about me?

Eventually, comments like these tapped me on the shoulder as I ordered shots. I shrugged them off for a while, until I had kids. that's when I decided to listen, get help.

I've been sober for nearly 18 months.

I want to use this space to track my new way of life... being sober.  Can I still have fun and socialise? 

My children are my reason for trying a new path. I want them to know me without being drenched in booze, too hungover to take care of them properly. There have been times where I wasn't able to be there, be a good Mum. I feel guilty. But do I deserve to get hammered at the end of the week after the grind of Motherhood has ground me down? or am I just making excuses to pour a bottle of wine down my throat on a Thursday afternoon?

is there a better way to deal with life? with nothing to lean on? I will need your support!

so check out my blog

411,1,Does anyone know where to find some information on Oxford Houses other than their website? I am currently in a newly formed Oxford House and have been searching around for info about some of the issues going on at our house. Being that the house is so new and most of the members are freshly out of treatment I am trying to find some precedents or others experience living in an Oxford House to help guide us. The website has a phone number and email address but that does no good for after hours questions. Possibly starting a subreddit for others to share their experience would be beneficial to others in the same position.
412,1," Largely a repost, but I felt it warranted further promotion--and refinement--for those who might have missed it last time around.

I created [r/EndOfTheParTy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EndOfTheParTy/) for those of us who are gay and trying to leave the parTy scene. Meth use is unfortunately at an epidemic level in the gay community, and it feels like we often resort to joking and stigmatizing each other about this issue rather than supporting and encouraging each other to make healthier decisions. This will be (I hope) a judgment free space where gay tweakers who are/are trying to get sober can find help through shared experiences and shared resources/approaches.

Please be respectful of the courage it takes to be open about this problem and to seek out help--some of my friends have died from meth overdoses, others are stuck in a living nightmare of permanent and irreversible psychosis. How we respond to people who are vulnerable can make all the difference for them. Please share the subreddit--or maybe [this link](https://www.actoronto.org/health-information/young-people/staying-off-crystal.pdf) about ways to limit and stop meth use--to anyone you think could use help in confronting this difficult, often ridiculed issue."

414,1,"Hi, I‚Äôm a current 2nd year occupational therapy student who has a clinical rotation in an inpatient psychiatric unit. I‚Äôm doing a little research on what have been good interventions in that setting, but I am also interested to hear personal experiences from other settings as well.

In case you‚Äôre unfamiliar with OT, we focus on activities of daily living that are meaningful to an individual and use those activities in a therapeutic way. Some examples of this can be cooking, helping an individual use the toilet/bathe as independently as possible after an illness/injury, and recommending/teaching the use of adaptive equipment.

From the mental health side, we mostly run groups. The topics range from coping skills to mindfulness to preparatory activities that make reintegration back into society if that is something an individual is struggling with (for example, homeless or recovering addicts).

Is there any specific activity or group that made an impact on you or you feel benefitted you in any way? I appreciate any feedback you can give me. Thank you!"

421,1,"No prior history of psychiatric/recreational drug use. (apart from 2-3 weeks on zoloft). I developed depersonalization/derealization disorder in December 2016, and recovered completely in August 2019. What I'm experiencing currently is very, very different to anything I experienced then.

September 1st to 5th (2019) : Took 5 mg of Abilify (Noticed my confidence levels beginning to decline, slight depression/dread/panic beginning to creep in, creativity/cognitive abilities seemed slightly diminished) September 6th to 15th (2019) : Increased dose to 10 mg (Symptoms listed above became worse, and developed severe restlessness) September 15th to 23rd (2019) : Tapered over a period of 1 week. Restlessness improved but other symptoms became slightly worse September 23rd to 30th (2019) : Depression continued to increase. On the 30th I started experiencing the worst case of depersonalization I've ever experienced. Severe depression, thoughts and emotions gone, could barely function cognitively. I'm a bit calmer now and the depression has subsided, but the main symptoms haven't improved still. During my previous episode of depersonalization/derealization I could read, think and function more or less normally.

I made arrangements to hookup with my old meth dealer. I don‚Äôt know how they got my new number, but they did. My heart raced when I was texting him. My body is preemptively reacting at the thought of getting high.

First thing I did was scour amazon prime for supplies: bubbler, torch, etc. to see what I can get before Friday. 

I was able to blow everyone else off (other dealers, etc.). I can‚Äôt figure out why this dude has a hold on me. I like him. Not romantically, but we had some good times and he‚Äôs decent people. Dude‚Äôs pretty damn attractive and I guess my self esteem is so low that the thought that ‚Äúhe can get any other dude, but he always reaches out to me‚Äù does something for me.

I know it‚Äôs not worth it. I know after we hookup, I‚Äôm going to buy from him and I‚Äôm fooling myself into thinking I can control it, or this time things will be different. 

I had probably one of the best, clean, holidays with my family and I‚Äôm about to throw all that real love away for some dick and a pipe.

ive been sleeping well and eating better in the last 6 months. and in the past month i started exercising‚Äî i still cant lose any weight.

prior to my addiction. i was one of those who would eat whatever and never gain weight‚Äî thats all changed.

I want to be more clear at work and advance. I want my son to have me fully present. And my house and car are an absolute mess. Here's to 4 days of many I hope. Everything will get better if i can do this.
437,1,Right now my mom is in the hospital. I am sitting waiting for take out and waiting at the bar. I ordered a water
438,1,Once it hits 11am. That is when the bad thing hits. That‚Äôs when the bar calls me. But if I keep busy as my mom is in the hospital I haven‚Äôt had time. Anyway it works if you keep distracted
439,1,"Had my annual post New Year‚Äôs party and I will tell you , I had a sip,a sip of wine, and stopped, thought ‚Äú all this commitment you are tossing our for what? A hangover? More weight gain? A current liver that is wishing for a good cleanse? Don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù .. and I didn‚Äôt , put glass down, poured some sparkling water and ate 3 sugar cookies üòß!!!! And spent the rest of the nite sober and remembered everything this a.m.  My New Year present to myself."
440,1,"I'm at the early stages of non drinking. I'm nearly 2 years in and  I still think I'm very boring. I cant get the mantra out of my brain that 'drinking is the only way to relax and have fun'. It's hard to change, rewire my way of thinking. I need more time. More sober time to accept this new way of living.

I have moments when I want to rip off my mums blouse and head bang to The Sex Pistols in a grimy underground club. I don't, because there is a bullshit secret etiquette I must adhere to. A secret code of mothers, a code that none of us transcribe to, its just there in the background of our pretend perfect parenting and occasioning slipping out of the mouths of nosey old ladies in libraries. The code seems to have no right answers and no boundaries so its hard to follow. it's impossible... which is why mums love it so much... because then we can watch other mums failing to adhere to these mysterious rules and judge them. Women are fucked up like that.

I don't want sneers at the school gates, so I hide my Anarchy in the UK tshirt by buttoning up my cardigan. I'm helping my community by doing this, not causing a fuss.... keeping the status quo without getting a rockers mullet. Lets just say I have started to dumb myself down since becoming a mum/sober warrior... in order to fit in. Easier for everyone. 

Occasionally I feel smug. I want to shout out how proud I am of me, for getting dry and for being this new sober person. I want to fling open chateau windows like women in perfume ads and yell that I've done something amazing. I want to say to other Mums that you can do it too and we can form an army of do gooders to spread the message... take over the world. But,  I don't, I hide here behind my lap top instead. I sit in a space where  judgement is possible but bearable. where i'm unreachable and unapproachable, out of the way of the.mum rules. I dont want to focus on me doing well. If I'm doing well I'm scared that everything else will fail. Then the warriors crumble.

I am a non-drinker, yes - woo hoo! but it doesn't mean I am doing well at life. I mean, I shat out a sequin this morning. It floated on the water, it looked like a magical unicorn had visited my bog. I'd been doing the hateful and oh so sweary Christmas wrapping while stuffing hummus and dips in my mouth. It sparkeled bright red like Dorothy's ruby slippers as it stubbornly refused to flush down the yellow brick commode. Admittedly my flush timing is weak, I don't have the patience to wait for the refill. I'm working on it.

After excreting half a Christmas tree I hit the beach in my pregnancy bikini. The suns not too hot I think inside my tiny mind (middle of summer in Australia)and  I burnt my body to a crisp.(see pic) My precious bump looked like a rubber ball, it had a shine to it for three days. I do stupid things a lot. I put my reading  glasses in the fridge. I  talk to answering machines. I wave at ducks. I send my son to school with blocks of cheese instead of lunch. I do all sorts of silly things. dumb decisions with relatively minor consequences and occasional speeding tickets.

Now  my sillies are forgettable - sober sillies I like to call them. When I compare them to my drunken sillies it makes my determination to never drink again as strong as a shot of absinthe on a Sunday morning. The things that I used to were way more dangerous, risky drinking things, foolish mistakes that could have led to rape, injury or death. Its such a massive difference to now. Shitting a sequin is much safer than sleeping with a stranger with wooden teeth and a bag of speed.  Retrieving my reading glasses from the fridge is better than walking  across spooky parks all alone or falling asleep in a grave yard. 

Waking up, feeling good knowing that the worst I have done is go to bed without putting the dish washer on is the kind of chaotic life I'm into now. it's life  - simplified. It's sobriety at its best.

Stopping drinking doesn't stop the daily grind, it doesn't stop the mundanity of caring for young children and it certainly doesn't give me a muggy feeling of being better than anyone else but it does cancel out all the shittiness, the panic, the dread, the shame and the morning after pill. it enables me to live life face on. run towards the fire because I know I can be of help. Sobriety makes me a functional person... a person that is great sometimes and rubbish at other times.

So, I break the unwritten mummy rules  - the one that says I should drink wine. I'm out. 

Actually  - I'm not out... I'm in. I'm always in!

is it 8pm yet? wayyyy past this punks bedtime."
441,1,"This time last year I started iv using meth cuz my GF at the time a junkie and convinced me that shooting up was worth it, even just once. Long story short, it became a long term thing and she put me through living hell. Ik time heals but I still hold so much resentment and the memories are triggering panic attacks and my depression."
442,1,Ive lived quite a few years as an addict. It has utterly ruined my life. The only thing I have left is that Im not dead. I want to be happy again. I want to find love and peace. I just want this depression to stop. The obsession with all of my failures almost keeps me from getting out of bed. I just want normal things. I want to not feel tbe crushing weight of my financial debt from a life of bad choices. I want to be someone people can look at as a decent person who is capable of sharing a life worth living with those around me. Im not sure what Im trying to say. Im just tired of feeling alone and living a life that doesnt feel like who I truly am or what Im capable of. I want that one last get out of jail free card to start over. But I know thats not how things work. Anyway thanks for reading.

444,1,"I‚Äôd say I probably hit bottom long before I decided to quit, and essentially just sat at the bottom hoping for change to reach me like sunlight through a cracked window. 

Staying sober has been the easy part. Digging myself out of the wreckage that became my life and finding purpose again has been the real challenge. I‚Äôll be 30 days sober here shortly, and the farther away I get from the past the better off I am. 

I have countless obligations I have to tend to in order to get myself back on the right path and it can be overwhelming sometimes. I‚Äôm not where I want to be. I don‚Äôt feel fulfillment, pure happiness or joy yet, and I won‚Äôt until I‚Äôm back on my feet. 

Between the daunting and mundane tasks I have to finish in order to get to where I need to be, I‚Äôve started a game with myself called ‚Äúpick 3.‚Äù In a bag, I‚Äôve written down a bunch of random things to do... some of them are part of my to-do list (organize the pantry, clean out my closet, make bags to donate to goodwill, etc), some are fun things (like little art projects... i.e. paint positive quotes on rocks to put around the house), and some are physical (today I have to complete 100 push-ups by the end of the day). Every morning when I wake up, I pick 3 at random and then I have to finish them by the end of the day. There‚Äôs something about being able to say I finished something I said I would that makes me feel so much more accomplished when I go to sleep at night. 

Just thought I‚Äôd share, maybe it will help someone else ‚ô•Ô∏è

447,1,"I have almost 2 months clean but I'm on vacation with my friends and I'm losing my mind. 

This vacation has been rough. People are in bad moods. There's a lot of negative energy on this trip.

On top of that, we are in the city where I went to college and I have been confronted with several really tough things from my past. 

I haven't had a full night of sleep all week. I'm stressed, anxious, tired, and overwhelmed. It's currently 3am and I'm wide awake and in a terrible head space. 

There's a friend's prescription bottle on the kitchen counter and I'm ITCHING for it. 

I know how terrible of an idea that is. I know that it would destroy a friendship and that it would not be worth it. But I'm close to not caring."
448,1,"I am now 109 days sober, alcohol having been my drug of choice. Initially, my skin was sort of clearing up - I could definitely tell it was becoming hydrated - but I am now constantly broken out. It appears to be cystic acne as the pimples are just so deep. My skin care habits were no different; though, since I've been breaking out, I switched to an unscented glycerin soap instead of a Dove product. I have continued to use a facial cleanser that has salicyclic acid which I use before bed each night. Has anyone else had an issue with acne after sobriety? I would love any tips that may knock out this issue.. I am thinking about trying an Adapalene Retinoid gel.. Thoughts? Thank you for any input!"
449,1,"ive found myself looking for this topic on this sub so i decided to just post my own feelings. 

i have 19 months clean, with varying levels of commitment to the program in that time. id say right now my commitment to the program is at the ""literally nothing"" level. no sponsor, one meeting every like three weeks at best. surprise: ive been having obsessive thoughts about my drug of choice. every day its on my mind. whats troublesome is these thoughts are no longer idle fantasy. it feels like ive basically decided to relapse. 

i havent done it yet because of some special circumstances. six months ago i moved to mexico. it's been great. i love it. i dont want to ruin mexico by making it ""the place i relapsed.""  plus i want my drug, not booze, and im not trying to do illegal stuff down here. finally im going to stay with my parents for a bit when i go back to the states in ten days. theyre in the program too and itll just complicate shit if they know i relapsed. if i relapse itll be when ive installed myself in my own place. 

(side note: the fellowship down here is great and i speak spanish so my lack of involvement in the program is purely my own fault.) 

so redditors in recovery, the sane part of me kind of knows im better off if i dont relapse, even though i really want to. how do you recover from an emotional relapse like this, without actually relapsing?"
450,1,I'm so buff now. And humble.
451,1,"This is the second time I have quit drinking heavily. Last time was 7 months ago in a detox facility. This time it's cold turkey on my own. Wednesday and yesterday were fine, this morning I was throwing up in the shower. I went to work anyways and feel better than I thought I would. 

It's worth it. I'm glad I got out of the house instead of staying in bed. 

But tonight is Friday, and I have a 2-day weekend ahead of me. That will be the test."
452,1,"In the first 30-90 days of recovery, what was the most important tool you used? In my experience, the first 30 days was a very dark time. I could have failed at any moment. My biggest help was routine. I scheduled my entire waking day in 30 minute installments. I kept a journal and sat down every morning before work and planned my day. It included bedtime/wake up time, hygiene, work, meetings, therapy, meals, chores, etc. I would fill any idle time with walks, exercise, trips to the library and coffee at the local AA club. This rigid structure allowed me to shift my focus away from my addictive behaviors for long enough to let the compulsive thoughts pass. I think this will be a great help to our brothers and sisters who are new to, or looking to start recovery. 

Tell us what you did to get through the first stages of recovery!"
453,1,"I never thought I'd make it here. I am only two months away from a year mark. Which is totally awesome. It has not been easy rebuilding a relationship with my family but I think they can see that I've changed and matured through recovery.  As my family has come around to the idea of a new me, a sober me we have become closer and closer. I wanted to share with those in their first couple days two things that really helped me, write down a list of everything you want for the year, kinda like a goal list, and when you reach the end of your first year recovered you will have received so much more."
454,1,"Did it! Kept driving past the grocery store and came home w/out bottle of wine.. fixed some dinner, watched some inane tv show and survived day 2. I tell you, this constant chatting is sooo helpful."
455,1,"Obviously different amounts of use different lengths of use, and which substance use makes a difference. I had two years of intense stimulant use, and months on I still feel off and not like myself. I can't really discern what would be attributed to trauma and what would be attributed to the substances itself hard to tell after a while."
456,1,I just got a message my cc line had been reduced .. am CC in debt... anyway I bought usually a bottle of wine let‚Äôs say average dAily but occasionally ever other day .....this last year.. cost at $13- a bottle $3900...  13* 300.. Holy S$&amp;@ üòß
458,1,I‚Äôve increased daily use of juul and other said products over the past year and a half. I‚Äôve used it multiple times daily for over 6 months and it feels more like a physical just smoking a juul addiction than the actual nicotine at this point but idk. I really want to quit but every time I try to I end up caving and buying another pod pack or device. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice or experiences from anyone who had gone through this and successfully quit. Extra info I tend to have an addictive personality but I really just want to drop this habit and am having a hard time. Thanks in advance.
459,1,"Seven years ago I started a journey I didn‚Äôt expect to happen, and never thought would last. But here I am, seven years later and still sober. It wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîit never will be. But it‚Äôs a journey I‚Äôm sticking with, and I hope you do, too. Thanks, and see you next year."
460,1,"So I went home to my mothers house for New Years and it went pretty well until she brought me home tonight. I was not in the best mood, I don‚Äôt really know exactly why, but I just wasn‚Äôt feeling good mentally. She could tell something was up and asked me what was wrong. I responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not in a good mood and I really don‚Äôt want to talk right now.‚Äù She continued to pry at me and somewhat bully me to try and get me to talk to her, but I just kept telling her that I didn‚Äôt want to. My Mom is a dry meth addict. She got sober 13 years ago on her own. She never went through any sort of program, and has never been to any sort of 12 step meeting. She still has a lot of her ‚Äúold ways‚Äù of thinking and acting like an addict. Such as not leaving me alone when I specifically express that I don‚Äôt want to be bothered. I‚Äôm in recovery, just recently got out of rehab and I‚Äôm living in a sober living home. I‚Äôm really tryin to change, but she can‚Äôt see or understand that. Does anybody have any advice for me, or does anyone have any experience in dealing with ‚Äúdry addicts‚Äù? It really bothers me, mostly because it‚Äôs my own mother that tests my sobriety the most. 

Thanks in advance."
461,1,"so last few months I noticed I have been drinking almost everyday and even caught myself smoking weed again after 6 years of break. scariest part was that nobody noticed, everybody just thought I have had good time and relaxed when in reality I've been escaping from reality. I have been 2 days sober and plan on being for the rest of the year. physically I feel terrible but mentally great. I wish luck and strength for anybody that's gonna try to do this also"
462,1,Slowly.. 1 margarita last nite which is like friggin monumental.. today zippo.. reading all these posts helps.. thanks
463,1,"Technically everywhere around me is getting rid of juul products and I just ran out of pods. I could try a different product, sure, but I think I‚Äôm just going to try giving up all forms of nicotine. I don‚Äôt really need it, and frankly I‚Äôm on a roll here with sobriety and all that. 

New year, new me, 100% addiction free. 

Wish me luck! Lol"
464,1,"I learned more. Oh 2019 had its difficulties? Mine had more. Ah, but you made positive change. I made more positive change. Anytime someone talks about what a year it's been, I swell with pride because for anyone who got sober this year, because we can't express in a tweet what a year of peaks and valleys it's been. Proud of you gals and guys, treat yourself to one of the many ways you've found to have fun while sober and celebrate what you've accomplished--or plan to accomplish in 2020."
465,1,"I say this because I've been that guy and feel kind of shitty about it in hindsight. Tis this season for resolutions and many friends have come to me this time a year and tell me they're going to stop using. As with any resolution (related to sobriety or not) my response was the stands ""oh yea? Let me know how that works out..."" If I had been more sincere I'd have helped rather than hindered. Don't be that person. Sometimes some people just need one person to believe in them. Be that person."

472,1,"Sorry this is a throwaway but people in my family know my reddit and I don't want my mom to fall apart because I'm having a bad week.

I haven't used drugs or alcohol for 6ish years. I wasn't going to meetings or participating in a program but life was going great and using never crossed my mind. I moved a several months ago and everything was fine but this week it's like 6 years of winning the battle is out the window. I don't even like drinking and keep having random urges to ""just go buy some wine"". If someone handed me opiates today I am 99% sure I would do them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to an AA meeting tonight because I thought it would help but I couldn't bring myself to talk and basically ran out the door at the end. I didn't feel better at all. I think I need support but I'm really worried that it will also open up the possibility of meeting people who actually could supply   
me my drug of choice. AA/NA can be great but there are always people there who are court ordered and keep using. I worry that with my current mental state those would be the people I would attract. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice reddit? Should I tough it out and see if my mental state resets or start just going to meetings daily or see a therapist? It's weird to be in such a bad place after years of feeling amazing."
473,1,"Let‚Äôs call him Charlie [25M]. I [24F] have been seeing Charlie for about two months but have known/loved him for over 8 years. Before things got serious, I learned that he had an addiction to cocaine. He told me that it was becoming an every day habit, however, when he found out that I was willing to give him a shot, he went cold turkey. He said that he knew doing coke would be a dealbreaker for me and he wanted me so he quit it immediately. 

I had no idea about the cocaine issue before. I was aware of an alcohol issue. I asked if he saw himself as an alcoholic and he said that he did not. Since we‚Äôve been seeing each other, I‚Äôve noticed that he doesn‚Äôt drink too often anymore. Sometimes when we go out and I get a cocktail, he‚Äôll grab a water. When he does get a drink, it‚Äôs only been one or two and then he‚Äôs done for the night. 

I recently found out that he did coke again. I gave him multiple opportunities to come clean and tell me himself but he lied to my face until I flat out asked if he was being deceitful with me. He broke down and admitted that when he got really drunk with his friends, he did coke. He also said that it was the third time it‚Äôs happened. Once in October, once in November, and now once in December. He seems incredibly remorseful and embarrassed as well as scared shitless that I‚Äôm done with him forever. 

I told him that I hope he gets help for himself and makes proper changes and succeeds. I made it clear that I was not mad at him. People make mistakes and that is okay. He‚Äôs since told me that he is absolutely cutting alcohol out of his life because that is what triggers him to do coke. He is also removing the friends who entice him to make bad decisions. He‚Äôs asking for my forgiveness and to stay with him, that he will not disappoint me this way again. I do love him and have a strong connection with him. I‚Äôm wondering if I should give him a second chance to redeem himself or if this is one consequence that he is going to have to deal with. 

I‚Äôm hoping someone has been in a similar situation and can help me figure out what steps should be taken next on my part, if any."
474,1,"While I was away for 4 weeks my partner of 14 years slipped right back into old habits and bought herself an ounce of pot. Please hear me out. To some this might not be a big deal, but over the last 17 years I quit all the serious stuff and finally had to give up pot because I ended up smoking day in, day out to the detriment of my business and my life. I had to quit to survive. 

Eventually so did she. For the last year, there had not been any pot consumption for either of us. I even quit cigarettes 9 months ago, which was very hard.

Now I just returned from being away for 4 weeks to find out that she‚Äôs gone and bought herself an ounce and smoked it all. Over the four weeks away I was tempted sooooo many times, but stayed strong. The relapse had consequences too, because she didn‚Äôt do anything at all apart from show up for work and play computer games. I now have to try and fix those consequences (boring everyday stuff that will be fixed with money, but it‚Äôs not like I have any to waste...).

I am so disappointed. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really need to take care of myself and make sure I stay clean for my own sanity. Is it really true that you cannot quit any drug while you‚Äôre with the person you we‚Äôre doing it with? I haven‚Äôt been to a meeting for ages, but am thinking of going because this is driving me coockoo.

Thanks for listening."
475,1,"In about a week I‚Äôll be hitting 5 months clean/sober/free whichever term you prefer best I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs not from something I ever get seen spoken about as a real form of ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù

For the last 5 years I dealt with extreme self injury/harming behaviours that lead me to developing a psychological addiction to cutting that at the end of it was putting me in the emergency room for staples/stitching 3 times a week

I got addicted to the adrenaline high and dopamine rushes I would get when my body would mask my pain with those wonderful highs, but the longer it went the worse the cutting got. 

This year alone I was admitted into psychiatric care 4/7 times total, the rest being last year, only 1 of those times were for suicidal actions, the rest we‚Äôre because I kept turning up to the hospital, every day needing new wound care, my worst day was when I did a very bad relapse, and then after leaving AMA when they called the psych team I had to come back in needing 57 staples because I had fucked up so bad.


It ruined my life for all these years, absolutely traumatised my parents, my mother before I moved out of home would hear me roll over in my sleep and wake up because she was so scared of finding me in the bathroom again. She was scared daily that in an hour she might come into the bathroom again to see me passed out on the floor, graphic details can be imagined from that, I don‚Äôt need to say it. 

I developed sepsis 3 times this year because of my body‚Äôs weakness and inability to heal when I was doing so much damage so often. I almost died because I tried to hard to get the best high I could get, ‚Äújust going a little further‚Äù 

Since I at the time lived in a small town, I was always seen by the same hospital, same doctors and nurses, it was a depressing frequent flyer except this one wasn‚Äôt seeking drugs or medication, just wanted to get wound care and fuck off back home to live it all out again as soon as I could. I‚Äôd go in completely manic and up as it was all a ritual that kept the high going, right until I woke up the next day, only then did I feel it start to crash and start again. They would give me too much Valium so I‚Äôd be quiet and sit down and let them work, and since it was 3+ times a week visits I started getting sent home with them, it lead to  daily Valium abuse and 6 months later I still get obnoxious cravings as soon as someone says the name. 

Anyway depressing part over I wanted to celebrate, After 5 years I‚Äôm finally a week away from 5 months clean and cut free, and I want to do something for myself, I‚Äôm working on tattoo coverups already for the scarring that‚Äôs old enough to be worked over, so I didn‚Äôt want to get myself another one since it‚Äôs a goal anyway, what do you guys do to give yourself some validation that you‚Äôre doing something good? 

I still get days where I feel like it‚Äôs pointless and there‚Äôs nothing changing from stopping and I should star again, (part of my autism brain needs to touch them to be real, if i can‚Äôt touch it it‚Äôs not real/not working/ not happening idk why) and I want a little physical proof apart from my scarring that things are better now I‚Äôve stopped and that it‚Äôs been worth the whole struggle.

Sorry it‚Äôs late and that‚Äôs probably awful to try read but I just saw the date and realised how close I am to the big 5 (5 years = 5 months is apparently super important to me) and wanted to also put my story out there so if anyone maybe ever saw this and went through something the same that maybe they can stop too and maybe it‚Äôll help people recognise addictions when they form"

He did heroin for about ten years but he says that he hasn‚Äôt really been thinking about that one, mostly just cocaine, molly, acid, cigarettes, or alcohol. He said that he‚Äôs had really bad depression and anxiety lately and he just needs something to do with his time to get his mind off of everything he could be doing (he‚Äôs been off of everything besides alcohol for about a year now).

I‚Äôm finding myself having so much more energy to focus on more important things. 2020 is going to be the year I turn it all around. If I stay sober for all of 2020, it‚Äôll be the first year I‚Äôve gone completely alcohol free since the first time I picked up a drink when I was 12.... in 2000. 20 years of drinking. I‚Äôm so excited to see how great a year can be without alcohol. I‚Äôve completely forgotten what that‚Äôs like.

My sponsor asked me to do some service work and give a lead tomorrow and I told him Im really not sure because I get nervous speaking in crowds, I gave a lead another time and it lasted 15 minutes and there was still 30 minutes left in the meeting, I felt so embarrassed. I share in meetings and like to talk one on one with other alcoholics, but I really don't want to lead.

Am I wrong for thinking this, and would it be wrong to tell him I don't want to do it on very short notice? I've tried to psych myself into it and its just not something I want to do.

Any advice could help!"
480,1,It‚Äôs been a month since I have taken any drugs and yesterday I relapsed hard. I‚Äôm home alone today and it‚Äôs just messing with me please PM I really want someone to talk to!
481,1,I hate the person I am and no one knows the real me. That I binge all weekend and hide in my room chain smoking.
482,1,"I have 48 days clean. I know it's not a huge amount of time but I'm damn proud of that. It used to be that I could never go more than a week without relapsing. 

This week, I am going on vacation with some friends. They don't use my drug of choice, but they do smoke weed and drink a lot. I've been planning this trip with them for a long time and did not want to give it up. Also the trip does not revolve around drinking or drugs, but my friends just have that as part of their life. 

To make matters worse, they don't really know about my recovery. I struggled with my drug of choice and they never knew about it, so it felt weird to suddenly tell them I was ""in recovery"" when they didn't even notice a problem. Plus I really wanted my recovery to be shaped around what I needed and not based on other people's opinions. So really the only people that know are me and my therapist at this point. 

Tonight I am sleeping on their couch before catching an early flight tomorrow. They spent most of the evening packing marijuana into cigarettes to take with them on the trip. They offered me an edible, I declined. They were chill with that. But it was very hard for me to stick to that and we're only on day one.

I'm not worried about being pressured or anything. But I am worried about whether or not I can do this. Even as I am writing this I'm thinking, ""would it really be that bad to smoke with them? You used to all the time and it's not like marijuana is what you're addicted to."" 

How do I find the strength? How do I remember that I don't want to do this?"
483,1,"I remember as I sit here why I abused dxm and it's many properties, I'm freaking out being in my late twenties and not having it all sorted out.

I recovered several years ago but recently meeting my girlfriend I don't know how to help her when I am not awake 24/7. So I have been looking for a positive discord server for her to be able to talk to people when she is feeling a compulsion."
488,1,"Relapsed 14 months ago and was stuck in that repetitive, last level of hell cycle.

It's gotten to a point where my drug dealer cut me off and every single friend has had an intervention like conversation with me.

This shit has turned me into a former shadow of myself - except now when I look at that shadow, it reminds me of the the reflection of whom it belongs to. 

I spent Christmas banging back 4 grams of coke and doing MDMA. 

Entire arm went numb for 12 hours, I was convinced I was having a stroke since I felt like my face was going droopy as well. No one was around. No one responded to my calls or texts. This is how I was spending my Christmas - fucking dying. Destitute. Pathetic. 

I got on my knees and had an intimate moment with God.

It was actually a reminder that I'm never alone and I'm always with God - except that fact gets overshadowed when I'm too busy gratifying my sensual desires. Akin to some pervert who spends his whole day masturbating. That's what drugs are,  
I was sober for six months in the past. Didn't even have a cigarette or a sip of beer. 

I told God that I want to become that person again. I want a shot at a great life. I've been offered an amazing career job for the first time in my life. I want to spend next Christmas with a significant other, Thousands of dollars in my bank account. One year of sobriety on lock. Feeling fulfilled creatively, spiritually. A friend group of people that multiply me as a person rather than divide me as one. 

My friend eventually woke up. I told him I'm done with this shit and I'm done with drinking. He started to laugh. I felt like that was the devil, symbolically mocking me. Not knowing that I'm serious. I'm not jeopardizing my sobriety anymore because I'm serious. I'm not going to these coke fuelled parties where the hosts are getting rich off my weaknesses.

Pray for me and I'll pray for you.

Lets not put ourselves in situations that are detrimental to our health.

489,1,"Being an alcoholic in recovery comes with many challenges, your whole social circle changes, where you go, what you do, who you meet. I am now 2 years sober and counting, which led me to another little issue, finding a partner.

The reason that this is close to my heart is that being a recovering alcoholic and I have relapsed before trying to find a partner due to the reason that I don‚Äôt drink. Before my relapse I would try and hide the fact that I didn‚Äôt drink from potential partners, but the inevitable happened and I went over. To me the feeling of years of hard work gone in a stupid lack of judgement made me feel even worse.

Having worked in IT for 25 years I ditched Tinder and bumble and set about creating a free to use meeting or dating service which I called Dry Dating. I wanted to create a safe honest place where people could meet other people in similar situations in the hopes that history would not repeat itself for me and other people.

I have a lot more knowledge in recovery than I had when I started my first detox 4 years ago and have a lot of people who really believe in this idea as they also have experienced the same issues. I am not here to sell anything, just to let people know that I now launched a free to use service to try and promote honesty and give the integrity to be up front about there past issues without being judged.

Its still a work in progress but hey its free and it works, I have launched an Android app, search android store for Dry Dating and scroll down or go to [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dry.dating.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dry.dating.app) . There is also a web-based version [www.dry.dating](http://www.dry.dating/) so please feel free to take a look.

If I can help just 1 person not make the same mistakes that I did then it will have been worthwhile.

490,1,"Hello. I am glad I found this subreddit, it is nice to have a connection to like-minded people. I have been in and out of the NA rooms for a couple of years now. Part of me knows that I am an addict and that it is making my life unmanageable. Whenever I go to meetings, I do feel better afterwards, but it is only due to the fact that I get extreme anxiety and fear sharing about myself and not really knowing what to say. I know it may sound silly, but that is one of the roadblocks that is currently affecting my recovery. Always to the point where I change lanes and procrastinate actually doing the work and working on myself.

Anyone who would rather leave this in written form can just comment below, and if you are willing to share a short voice message, please mention that in the comment and I will reach out to you with how to do that.

I picked him up as he said he wanted tonget sober and he tried going to rehab and ran back to his DOC.  Now hes taking an anti craving drug (his choice) and therapy, he claims he is clean but i worry the obstacles to sobriety are much bigger now.

497,1,"Today I wanted to get blackout shitfaced more than I have since I decided to get sober. Today was fucking rough. Felt like I had my heart ripped out of my chest and stomped on this morning and all I wanted to do was drink it away. Things are really complicated with the guy I‚Äôve been talking to since August. It‚Äôs no fucking fairy tale, that‚Äôs for sure... but for some reason even after everything, I keep finding myself saying he‚Äôs worth it. 

Shit happened this morning that I don‚Äôt really want to get into, and I used the voice recorder on my phone to record over 7 minutes of him explaining himself to me without him knowing. I just replayed it back and I‚Äôm upset all over again. I have an incredibly raw and ugly truth saved on my phone that makes me sick, but I feel like I need to listen to it, maybe knock some sense into my brain. Maybe save myself before it‚Äôs too late. 

Well, anyways, I didn‚Äôt drink. I still sort of want to and I‚Äôm surrounded by booze for the next 5 days, but I‚Äôm hanging in there. He‚Äôs worth hanging around for, but he‚Äôs not worth getting drunk over and risking my sanity. I‚Äôm not going to let this get to me. Yeah my heart hurts, but the feeling isn‚Äôt new to me.

Used to kill a bottle of whiskey or gin every night. Been sober 4 years 5 months. Never went to AA ‚Äì just not for me but I‚Äôve met a lot of AA people who have encouraged me along the way. I quit drinking cold turkey. Never been in trouble with the law or anything; honestly, I don‚Äôt have an interesting story. I just started working out and I landed a dream job. That was enough to keep me sober. Once I was sober for awhile I swore I would never turn back. Turns out I was wrong. With everything that‚Äôs going on I lost my job, Isolated, can‚Äôt see my friends or my BF, etc. Same stuff most people are dealing with. IDK why but I decided to buy a bottle of vodka (not even my drink of choice) Last two nights I‚Äôve been drunk. I hate this and I want to stop before this becomes a huge issue again. I was hoping someone here had some advice."

I went 7 weeks in the fall and felt amazing. Convinced myself that I could handle my drinking so I started again.  Here we are, drinking every night.

Feeling overwhelmed, I don't want drinking to be my only hobby."
5,1,"25M here, long time lurker but diet time poster. Just wanted to share a little bit of my story - today I graduated from an inpatient residential drug and alcohol abuse treatment center. I chose to check myself in on March 2nd after a particularly bad bender and it was the best decision I‚Äôve made in my adult life. As I started to sober up I noticed how brilliant colors were for the first time in years! After the detox process I refused any other drugs as I wanted to do this as naturally as possible (I have nothing against using anti depressants or anxiety meds to help cope especially in early recovery but I wanted to challenge myself and do it this way for me) 

It was amazing how much fun I had in there and how many great people I met - both patients and staff. I am continuing with outpatient treatment offered by the facility for the next couple months and I actually look forward to going. I have found myself a sponsor who is well suited for my needs and I check in every night and he is helping me work my way through the 12 steps. 

For the first time in years I feel positive about what my future holds! The possibilities are endless. I know I‚Äôm just starting my journey and one month may not seem like much but I‚Äôm proud of myself. 

So today and every day forward IWNDWYT!!"
6,1,"When I‚Äôve looked at what‚Äôs considered healthy drinking, it says one drink a day for women. Why would anyone want one drink? What‚Äôs the point?

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm a naive young problem drinker and this is a stupid question. I genuinely just don‚Äôt understand"
8,1,"I quit drinking properly for the first time 2069 days ago.

I only know this because I just checked my badge. Sadly that number isn't a true reflection of my sober days - my current badge number is. I seem to recall making it to around 430 days before relapsing and it has taken me a further 1639 days to bring me back to this point where I am ready to stop again.

I don't see it as over 5 years wasted, I see it as the journey I am on. It's not the journey I planned or want but it is mine none the less.

It is humbling to think however, if I hadn't of started drinking again I would have been over five and a half years sober. It went in the blink of an eye.

So I am making this post to make myself accountable for today. I am not going to drink today.

10,1,"After two days of medically monitored detox at the hospital, I just found out my family/support system worked their asses off and found me an open bed at a rehab facility about an hour away. They have the standard rules of what you can and can‚Äôt bring, no phones but I can bring my iPod classic, no kindle, etc. I am allowed to bring exactly 10 days worth of clothing.

I can have visitors come and drop stuff off for me every day, but I won‚Äôt be able to see them. I have a pretty good idea of the essentials that my family will be able to pack for me, and I tied up every loose end (bills, work, etc.) that I could from my phone in the middle of the night.

For those that have been through this before, what is some advice you could give me? Are there any tips for making my first trip to rehab feel less scary?"
11,1,"I‚Äôm 14 days sober and I wasn‚Äôt super addicted to alcohol to begin with but I was starting to feel negative effects and it was a bit hard to stop with some pretty intense cravings in the first couple of days.

Doesn‚Äôt really bother me because I know it‚Äôs not real and I have the willpower to say no, I just thought it was really interesting. Anyone else have those?"
12,1,"but I am so glad I've been sober for 3 years! This group was probably the most important part of my sobriety. 

Some things that have been better:

Sleep

Poops (and poop control)

relationships with wife and kids

being present and available at all times of day and night

returning the favor to my wife by being the designated driver after every party. That was her job for 20 years

ended a difficult work-personal relationship

didn't gain any weight

more regular and deeper meditation practice and exercise

saved thousands of $ in drinks and food

setting a better example for my kids

I think I influenced a few people to either stop or reduce their consumption

won a few poker hands

When I decided to drink exactly three years ago, I didn't know if I would be able to do it. I had tried everything - moderation, counting drinks, drinking only on weekends, etc. etc. nothing stuck. What I learned from this sub has stuck. One day at a time has stuck. If I can do it anyone can try and if you try you can succeed. Here's wishing everyone a happy sober day!

If was just me I would be ok and would go live in a tent somewhere.  The problem is it isn't just me.  It's my wife, a 3 year old and a six week old.   The amount of pressure is really starting to mount up. I keep asking myself did I save enough for this.  How long is this going to last is the answer, but that is such a moving Target.  Ontop of all of this my 3 year old is very high risk for Covid-19 so everything thing we do is scrutinized to ensure we are keeping him safe.

Here goes day one round two."
20,1,"I fled from an abusive relationship in my early 30's, I used pot to cope, for years before I left. I moved back in with family, lost 100 pounds, and met a wonderful man after a while. And three years ago, I discovered alcohol. I'm going to be 37 this year.

I'm normally a very boring, shy, quiet, soft spoken person when I'm sober. When I drink, I become fun, outspoken, brave, interesting (maybe I just hate myself less). But I know that I'm killing myself because I'm drinking so much. I work from home, call center shit, I hate my job...and one drink to numb myself from the suffering at work is all it takes before I start sneaking off to the kitchen to take another sip and another and another, and by the end of my shift I've taken easily between 6 and 10 shots, and the drinking continues from 6pm when I'm done with work, until 3am. I'm ""only"" going through half a handle a day now, since I've tried to cut back, it was actually worse before, but I know this is absolutely unacceptable still. I've tried counting out 1oz little disposable shot glasses and limiting and then reducing the number of shots I take that way, but my dude is judgmental (worried), rightfully so, about my drinking...and I find myself sneaking them and forgetting to add the sneaky drinks to the count.
I had a doctor's appointment last year because of insane hives and weird nail problems, strange allergies, and other weird health ailments. I've also gained back almost the entire 100 pounds, nearly 50 of it just within the last year with no other changes in my diet. I was completely honest with the doctor, he said I had severe alcohol dependency and recommended treatment. I declined, I want to try to fix this myself. I have a therapist I talk to every week who is helping, more or less, but honestly...not really. My mom's an alcoholic, and generally speaking, she's my whole world and all the family I have left. I did quit for an entire week towards the end of last year...I was so proud. My mom said I couldn't be an alcoholic if I quit that easily, and I felt...offended? What the hell is wrong with me. I didn't start again because of her, I drank because I needed lubrication for social interaction, I was meeting a few different strangers and really can't hold a conversation when I'm sober...and I haven't managed to go a day without since then. I'm hoping maybe if I post this, tomorrow can be day one. I'll taper if I have to, but I need this to be something I used to do instead of an active addiction.

Thanks for listening to my story, if you made it this far."
21,1,"I believe I would have put myself and others in danger. I would have taken unnecessary trips to the store for alcohol.  I know for certain I would have needed to make sure I had plenty on hand.  I would have used the pandemic as a GREAT excuse to drink!  The world is going to hell why wouldn't I drink! I would have felt completely justified.  Instead I am present completely.  Not always easy, but you know if someone needs me, I can be there.  My moods are more stable.  If I was drunk, sickly and weak, I would have made it all about me.  I actually feel strong. If I do catch this thing I want to be as physically strong as I can be.  Alcohol weakens the immunity system- NO THANKS! Let's face it, when you are addicted to alcohol you want reasons to drink!  As much as it sickens me to say it, I wonder if there would have been a small part of me that was happy for the crisis - NO ONE CAN QUESTION MY DRINKING!  ICK disgusting! When this horrible event is over, if I did everything I could to ride it out with dignity that will be something I can be proud of.  Alcohol will not make one thing about this crisis better it only has the potential to make it all much much worse.  Thanks for reading!"

I started about 10 years ago, in my early 20s. Back then I felt it was a choice, now I feel like I have no choice at all. If I don't buy my wine, I have this superpower to almost completely stop time, and it will make me feel like shit before it helps me feel okay for a short time, then I feel like shit again.

I am just really good at hiding it. My dad was an alcoholic growing up, and he was the same way, the only one who ever j ew he was drinking was my mom. I just don‚Äôt know how to stop but I feel to ashamed to tell anyone or ask for help. Where do I start, when my first drink usually happens just to make the shakes stop?"

a) having a meeting online tho is so much nicer even conceptually than actually driving to somewhere and finding the room and planning on traffic and etc etc. just open zoom

b) i've complained about AA a lot on here but the cravings are really very bad for some reason and also, horribly enough, I'm craving the structure and familiarity given the pandemic

c) it's 10PM and there's nothing in indiana, probably. but i can pretend I live in LA which is also super cool and convenient because online shit"

After ten million fuck ups, a relationship with the only girl ive ever loved down the drain, my relationship with my brother in absolute shambles, friends ive fucked over time and time again and pretty much everyone else in between. I‚Äôve decided to get the help I deserve. I spoke to drug alcohol services over the phone they were lovely. I will get a phone call from them tomorrow. I will speak to my doc about seeing a psychiatrist because I can‚Äôt handle the anxiety triggers. And they will work together in unison to get me better. I want this. I so fucking want this for me and my family and my future wife and kids. I‚Äôm 31 and I am so much better than what I‚Äôve been doing to myself for 10 years.

37,1,"So here i am, today is my 4 month Anniversary. Its been a hard road, though im glad i have taken it. If i kept on it i would be dead within a couple years.

Iv always wanted to cut my drinking back and never thought it was THAT bad i mean. A handle a month. Turn 2 handles. Turned to 3 handles till it was a handle or a 2 a week with my room mate. Mostly on the weekends. Gotta work you yanno? Can not go in sweating it out for everyone to smell.

Cut back to August 16th 2019. Im in a cross walk. Got hit by a car, rolled over the hood and fucked my knee up good. No broken bones but DAMN was i hurting. So. No work. I get to drink woooo.

Well that drinking ramped up hard. My depression hit even harder. Self medicated the depression prior with drinking and videogames on the weekend and unless i had my two little girls than i was dry and spent all my time with them during the weekend. During the week i worked my self to the bone 50-60 hr work weeks and finding small jobs to do. My girls and playing Pool was the only thing i felt living for. Some days. Things were rough with the GF but getting better. Que back to get hit and just drinking all day. Couldnt drive to get my kids, ex Finance couldnt bring em so i drank. And drank. And drank some more.

Well august 30th. Helped my GF get ready to go out with her gfs. Told i would see her in the morning. Come next morning. Head on over use they key she gave to go in... Found her in bed with another man at 730am. Fan-fucking-tastic. Great 3 years down the drain.

Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. 

Only thing i knew how to cope. Drinking, and being a man hoe. So i did for a couple weeks. Got tired of hoeing to new girl every couple nights. Im old i guess didnt see the fun in it anymore.

Nov1st at at about 1am. I roll my truck off the interstate avoiding some break checking me. Break my nose, pull some muscles im alright. I got lucky. My passenger almost died. Didnt have their seat belt on. Went from the front to the back seat with a couple fractures...

Well than. Decided i need to drink to cope again. Fast forward a to thanksgiving. Had dinner with my brother, my kids, my ex, anf my mom who flew out from IL to see me and my girls.. Great me and the ex argued some. Than she got grounded and told to go home (shes 27 btw) be cause Exmil is raging cunt. So lost time with my girls on the first holiday in 2 years i was able to have them, even though i shared it with my ex.

Well i decided for the next 2 and half days to drink a little over 5L of yeager and Crown. Ended up falling over a waist high fence. Dislocated my elbow and than broke it the way i landed. Its a foggy memory but i remember screaming in pain jumped up and popped it back into place. Well. Called 911 and xrays showed it broken. Fantastic. I just cant catch a fucking break since August sobered up and cried. Straight broke down crying. Im not a horrible father. But im far from the best....Asking my mom for help. She took me out to IL the next day with her home to go to rehab and to heal. Emotionally, physically, and mentally.

Its been r months since i broke my Elbow. 4 months since my last drink.

The road ahead is still tough. Made harder by this Virus going around trying to get back home to the state i live. I miss my girls who i love so fucking much. I miss working, which thankfully i have an AMAZING Boss and still have a job. The man remembers when my oldest was born 8 years ago this month. He is a great friend as well and has always had an open door when i needed it. Im blessed to have him.

I wanna go home. As bad as it sounds i miss video games sold them to have a few bucks in my pocket since i wouldn't have any money. Been living in the country bored out of mind.

This virus caused my mom to lose her job so shes barely making ends meet. And trying to figure out how im gonna get home.

I will. This road is road but worth it. I can only go up from here.

Keep your eyes on the light in the tunnel and it will only get better."

Someone on here wrote once, ‚Äúthe best anti-anxiety medicine is sobriety.‚Äù  Absolutely true.  That stuck with me.  I was a nervous wreck and now I face these weird days with relative peace and a head on my shoulders.

40,1,"Had a pretty big break through today about what is most likely the under lying cause of my drinking, my anxiety, depression, and fear of allowing anyone to get close to me. I was listening to a podcast and they mentioned something about being molested as a child. The way the described finding out and their initial thought that it was normal sparked something in me. I remembered back to when I was a child that an older man exposed them self to me inside a men's swim locker room. I had to be younger than 8 years old. I remember them coming under the stall with their parts out asking me what I thought. It's a memory that I have tried so hard to repress for years. Now at 27, I never wanted to be viewed as weak, non manly, or whatever else goes along with being a man. So I have repressed the memory by over doing everything I have ever gotten into, including drinking. Hearing that today just took me to a place of mental clarity where it all came back. I guess this is a good first step. I don't know how to tell anyone but I figured here was a good place to start."

On top of being out of work and isolated, I can‚Äôt manage to get my recent ex off of the forefront my mind no matter how hard I try to distract myself, and it‚Äôs continuing to bring about a lot of feelings of sadness, anger, and resentment toward my current situation as a whole. In the past, alcohol has always numbed the pain and served as a temporary distraction of sorts. The alcoholic in me is so tempted to get in the car and drive to the liquor store right now, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can to remind myself of where that first drink ultimately leads to and the trouble that it will inevitably cause me. I know I need to face these feelings head on and remember that even though it‚Äôs hard right now, it will get easier with time. This is only temporary. IWNDWYT."

45,1,"Hi everyone, sorry for the long post, but I need someone to talk to. 

I'm in my mid 20's, female, and I have drank alcohol almost every day since turning 18. It's become really bad over the last 2 years, I've been drunk most days. I've tried to quit multiple times, but so far it's always been for social reasons.

Last week, I woke up and vomited blood. (Not a huge amount, and I didn't go to hospital.) 

The worst part is that this has happened before, I think three times, all in the last year. This time though, (not to be too graphic,) there was also evidence of blood in my poop. The first time it happened, I freaked out, and stopped drinking, but only lasted a week. 

This time, I wasn't scared if dying. 

 I'm scared that I'll succeed in recovery, get my life on track and then find I've done permanent damage, and I'll have to live with the sadness of that for the rest of my life. I don't know if I could cope with that. I'm not suicidal, but at least if I fall seriously ill now it would be easier to deal with, as I'm so unhappy anyway. 

I want to live a long, happy life, and am so sad that I might have thrown it away already, no matter what I do from now. This is my biggest fear - that I'll never be happy again, no matter what I do. 

I haven't ever been to a doctor about my drinking, so have no idea what damage has been done. Due to Covid, I can't go to a hospital now anyway (unless it is absolutely necessary), and tbh I'm not ready to find out. If I get bad news now, I'll never stop drinking. I know I'll need to find out at some point, but I really can't cope with it right now.

I am determined to stop now, and never go back. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with my fears? I know it's stupid, but the fear of the damage I've already done it what is most likely to cause me to fail.

Thank you so much for reading. IWNDWYT, and hopefully, never again."
46,1,"Today is 1500 day for me. Not much I can do to celebrate, I am basically staying at home and my town and state are shut down. But I am trying to stay appreciative of what I have.

These have been pretty unusual days and week and I hope everyone is doing ok. My anxiety triggers have been way up, and just been trying to exercise as much as I can to cope. If anyone reading this and sober, I really applaud and appreciate your courage and power. Just take it one day at a time. IWDWYD!"

Mind racing, images flashing through my head Like a warp speed slide show.

Sweating, room spinning, vertigo, twitching, in and out of sleep. Finally slept from about 4 to 830 off and on but mostly on.

Woke up today with more  energy, normal bowels (sorry).

Cleaned up the house. Walked the dog about 2 miles. Ripped up weeds by the mailbox and ripped out two dead bushes. Most energy I've had in weeks if not months. Chugging water and my appetite is back, eating like a machine again.

Hoping that leads to better sleep tonight.

50,1,"Some background; I relapsed a little over a year ago. I led the police on a pretty long chase. No one was hurt and there was no property damage.

I spent a couple months in jail before going to inpatient fo 80 days. I've been in sober living since I left inpatient back in July of last year. Everything been going well with treatment, probation and sober living. 

I just have a strong urge to drink a little vodka to take the edge off. We've been doing treatment through Zoom, a video conferencing app. I miss getting out of the house everyday. 

Also, one of my roommates puts me on edge. I can't name one specific thing he's done, it's just a strong gut feeling. 

It's been a long journey to get here and I hate risking everything for a little vodka. I would likely get kicked out of my sober house and would be homeless. Probation might decide to execute my sentence which is 300 days."

I don‚Äôt know how to even attempt to begin something. I can tell my wife is irritated I‚Äôm not doing anything with all this time, she‚Äôd kill for some free time where she isn‚Äôt exhausted right now. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre living exact opposite extremes. 

I know so many people have similar and much worse stories right now. I‚Äôm thankful for what we do have.

54,1,"hey all. hope this is ok to post, new here.
for some history, i'm 23, i hadn't drank much at all this year, but started again this month. i got a fifth of whiskey and a L of wine on the 20th and finished that over maybe a week or so, then had a few sober days. this last saturday, i got a 1.75 L of whiskey and have drank around half of it. i don't know for sure how much i drank last night, but i believe it was around six shots. 
i didn't feel hungover this morning, but felt a little ""off"" and got paranoid i'm having withdrawls. i'm a little dizzy and kind of out of it and incredibly anxious, but i do have a dissociative disorder and anxiety that could be the cause of the last two. no other symptoms, and it's been around 15 hours since my last drink. i don't believe i've had withdrawl before - would you know if you're withdrawling?
and if i could be, is there an anonymous hotline or a teledoc service i'd be able to do? unless i need to be hospitalized i'd like to avoid a doctor in person with covid going around. i feel like such a bonehead for drinking again especially during all this."
55,1,"A lot of times we talk about learning to be OK despite discomfort.  And I think that is a wonderful lesson!  Before, whenever the mildest discomfort came, I would run away with a drink or a drug.  I couldn't handle life on life's terms.  In order to get better it was imperative that I get OK with not being OK.

But somewhere in there I think I got a little lost.  Somewhere in there I started thinking that I had to be not OK all the time.  Like it wasn't OK just to be myself, be a human, relax, not nitpick every little thing about my life.  It's like I have to be constantly striving for self-improvement, growth, and total serenity or else I'm ""missing out"".

I think it's a behavior that's been reinforced since childhood, and it's good to recognize that.  But that's not to say I should blame the world for the perfectionist in me.  Even if the whole world wants to live that way, I still have the right not to.  I still have the right to say, ""Nah, I think I'm just going to take it easy.  I'm tired of living the other way.""

And today that's what I'm choosing to do.  

It's OK to be OK."

Why can't I find the tiniest bit of motivation and focus for my work right now? This too shall pass.

59,1,Hello all!  I wanted to share a link that will bring you to my story.
60,1,"I‚Äôve been a lurker here for years at this point, as it‚Äôs one of the most wholesome communities on reddit. I‚Äôve known I should significantly cut back my drinking for years, but I always put it off because I‚Äôm not your stereotypical alcoholic, so it can‚Äôt be that bad, right?

I‚Äôm posting this to let you know why I‚Äôm now taking action and see how many of us are/were ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äú. Maybe my story can scare others like me into taking action too! 

Warning: long stream of sleep deprived consciousness.

The problem is I don‚Äôt get ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù drunk anymore and haven‚Äôt in years, so I felt like my drinking was under control. I drink my 5 - 10 (closer to 10 more often than not) standard drinks every evening across 6 hours. I don‚Äôt feel the urge to drink more than I do. I‚Äôm not moderating. I just don‚Äôt want to drink more than I do. My partner doesn‚Äôt drink more than 1 or 2 most days and frequently goes without, but doesn‚Äôt consider my drinking a problem because I give off no warning signs. Nobody knows how much I drink or would pick me as an alcoholic, or a likely candidate for cirrhosis, or that I struggle to go a single evening without ‚Äúa few‚Äù. Even when I was drinking my heaviest, most strangers, friends or family can‚Äôt tell when I‚Äòm drunk, even when I‚Äòm shitfaced. I‚Äôve even had people tell me they didn‚Äôt know I was drunk when I was blackout and can‚Äôt remember the conversation. People can only tell when I‚Äôm slurring or puking, which is rare. I‚Äôve avoided shots and getting drunk enough to wake up with a hangover for a good 5 years, successfully 99% of the time. Haven‚Äôt had a blackout in years either.

I don‚Äôt know when I started drinking every day, but I‚Äòm guessing it was about 13 years ago. In my younger days I would go out drinking with friends in hospitality multiple days each week, and occasionally end up having too many and puking or blacking out. On days when I stayed at home I‚Äôd have wine or mixed spirits, carefree and never really tracking my consumption or worrying about how much I was drinking; knowing I should cut down in future, but not worried about the present because future me can worry about that. My housemate also drank almost every night, so I was in the perfect enabler company. My drinking continued this way for a few years up until about 5 years ago, where a stressful job increased my drinking to glaringly obvious (to me) alcoholic status. I still don‚Äôt think I was physically addicted, as when I quit that job I went cold turkey for a week without any withdrawal symptoms, despite drinking upwards of 10 - 20 standard drinks a day for months, but that was when I knew I had a problem and needed to cut down significantly or I would die. Of course I returned to ‚Äúbeers only‚Äù and would have 4 - 6 of low carb a night (5 - 8 standards).

I‚Äôve always said I would quit if there were signs of damage. I even tried Revia, but its side affects made it unviable. The problem I always rejected is that the liver is so good at what it does, a majority of the time it only starts to show signs of damage when it‚Äôs nearly failing and too late to return to normal function. I have a friend who never drinks alone, but would drink heavily on Friday/Saturday; he once hit 10x the upper limit on liver stats and got an immediate fibroscan done. The results were fine, but he stopped drinking as the dr said his liver could not handle his weekend bingeing.

I get my blood and liver function tested at least every 6 months, and only my most recent liver function showed **both** stats above the upper limit for the first time, and *only* about 20% above. A few years ago I even tried getting super drunk the day before a blood test, hoping the results would warrant a liver scan, as I know it‚Äôd be much easier to stop if there were obvious signs of damage. I had maybe 20 - 25 standard drinks and woke up with a hangover specifically so I‚Äôd have alarming results. Again, as always, only one of my liver stats exceeded the upper limit and only slightly; reassuring me I was fine.

I‚Äôve noticed more and more general symptoms over the last year that indicate my past has caught up with me, that I‚Äôm no longer ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and drinking is finally taking a noticeable toll. Faint mild internal pains (and occasionally sharp quick ones) that come and go in various parts of my abdomen. Lymph node inflammation. General malaise. Sweet smelling urine. Horrific smelling poops. Benign painless cysts appearing in random locations. Bruising very easily and bruises lasting longer. The heartburn/reflux/GERD (likely from alcohol abuse) has spurred more and more noticeable dysphasia (spasms when I swallow too larger chunks of food) in my esophagus. My last results of complete blood work and urine/STI tests etc came back all good, except for the elevated liver enzymes. I was finally honest with my Dr though, and she told me I need to stop immediately and referred me to a drug and alcohol center.

I often envied people here that drank so much they had to stop or they would certainly die; drank so much it gave them clear warning signs that scared them straight... It feels harder to quit when there‚Äôs a possibility you could get away with it for decades more without life threatening damage. Unfortunately I‚Äôm able to easily maintain a low level of alcohol dependence without embarrassment or noticeable impacts to work, finances or relationships. I drink less now than I did 5, 10 or 15 years ago. I only drink to the point of a decent buzz. But dammit. Each and every night around 5pm, I really want a drink. 

Still though, alcohol is a poison and I can tell if I continue to drink as I am, there‚Äôs a real possibility I may not make it another 5, 10 or 15 years (I‚Äòve probably already done irreversible damage) so I guess it‚Äôs time I say goodbye to alcohol. I‚Äôve decided to not stop drinking with you all only for today, but forever too.

Big thanks to u/mangocupoftea for [this post](https://reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fstjqb/ive_been_wanting_to_post_this_for_a_while/) and scaring me into taking this step. I know I‚Äôll probably fail a few times but at least I‚Äôm now being honest with myself and what I need to do. Hopefully any future failures don‚Äôt push my body over the edge of no return (and I haven‚Äôt already)"

62,1,"Hey all just wanted to start a post where we talk about all the ways your sobriety has helped you though this crisis so far .  

I know I have been reading a lot of posts how folks are struggling and if you are please reach out .  For anyone new ,including me, early sobriety is a tough one especially given the state of things .  I hope if you are struggling right now you know you don‚Äôt have to do it alone , reach out and someone will answer .  

So here is a few things that have to say are really positive in the last two weeks. I have been socially isolating at home with my partner and child .  Spending a lot of quality time with my son has been amazing , though he gets on my nerves I feel like I‚Äôm just showing up for him day after day.  Today we started his first day of homeschooling and I put together a lesson plan and have spent the day so far working though the lesson plan. It‚Äôs been great !! 

I also love how I don‚Äôt feel like crap.  I‚Äôm getting good sleeps and I feel strong . I feel like I can focus on making sure everyone is taken care of in my circle.  I am delivering grocery‚Äôs to the seniors in my family and making sure they are well looked after .  I also have extra money in my pocket after a few months of not getting pissed all the time so that again is helping financially though this thing .  Im feeling a bit down about the whole situation but for the most part my depression has not really been present which is amazing . 

The old me would have used this as an excuse to get drunk for days on end.  There is a voice in my head that tells me that I should have some drinks but today I made a choice and tomorrow I‚Äôll make another one .  Stay safe out there and thank you for all the love .  You folks are amazing and I love you all ."
63,1,"Looking for a buddy to check in with. I'm not quiting drinking forever and I'm not AA amenable. I don't know if I'm asking the wrong forum. I've taken breaks from alcohol for a few weeks at a time all on my oncey and they've been helpful. I'm trying to do that again and failing.

65,1,"Like many, I'm currently out of work and advised to stay home. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I have the attention span of a squirrel right now; any attempt to indulge in a leisure activity (guitar, games, books, whatever) successfully occupies my mind for approximately 10 minutes, then it again begins wandering very rapidly. My current urge to run across the road to 7-11 and grab ""Just a beer or two!!"" feels very overwhelming. I have the tools and knowledge, and keep reminding myself of why I stopped in the first place, that one or two drinks will quickly turn into one or two weeks and absolute misery, that alcohol destroys everything I care about every time I get off the wagon. All such thoughts, at present, feel entirely futile.  None of these realizations are minimizing the urge; my rational mind is currently playing tug of war with the addict that resides deep inside me, and I feel like my grip is slipping...

I wish all of you happiness and health during these trying times."
66,1,"Had a phone follow-up from my detox with my PCP today. He basically calmed my paranoia about my liver, but he did tell me that I need to strongly consider avoiding alcohol altogether because my liver is fatty. It‚Äôs fatty because, well, I am fat, but I also drank alcohol. He told me that I can reverse it by avoiding alcohol and also making smarter food choices‚Äîmore water, less soda, etc. He said my ultrasound that was taken in the ER looked normal except for the fatty liver.  He wants to see me in a few months after COVID-19 has subsided to check me over and see how I‚Äôm doing on my blood pressure meds. Overall, I am very happy.

I had been living like an alcoholic for years but never had the chance to see it‚Äôs whole face. People who are hitting bottom now, I have a few pieces of advice and I hope you make it through without permanently damaging yourself or other. Don‚Äôt let the fear leave ,ever, you must know the cost that you must pay to drink, use that fear when everyone else is having fun on a Friday night. For you, alcohol will kill you so acknowledge the loss of ‚Äúfun‚Äù and embrace a new life where everything is beautiful at 10am on a Saturday, this is the new you, this is where your fun lives. It‚Äôs a trade, not a loss. This is what you‚Äôre about now. And if you do have just one drink, you will have to give your life in exchange, and it‚Äôs not worth it. Your life has become so difficult and out of control, at some point it becomes easier not to drink as your emotional jenga tower of emotions is too difficult to manage. These three things have kept me for almost 3 years from drinking."
68,1,"This is how I hit rock bottom. No work for a month. The scary thing is that it was always there. The emotional decay and neglect was always eating at me. I had been living like an alcoholic for years but never had the chance to see it‚Äôs whole face. People who are hitting bottom now I have a few pieces of advice and I hope you make it through without permanently damaging yourself or other. Don‚Äôt let the fear leave ever, you must know the cost that you must pay to drink, use that fear when everyone else is having fun on Friday night. For you, alcohol will kill you so acknowledge the loss of ‚Äúfun‚Äù and embrace a new life where everything is beautiful at 10am on a Saturday, this is the new you. These two things have kept me for almost 3 years from drinking."
69,1,"I used the start of quarentine to get sober - made it to two weeks and then my brother handed me a beer. Now a week later I'm drinking more then I ever had. No responsibilities or structure has pushed me to a new low and I don't know where to go. I'm really scared where this will take me...

I've loved reading through this community but I'm scared I'm not strong enough to tell those around me that I need to quit...or even how to start...

How did everyone come to terms with asking others for support? I'm scared of the label, I'm scared of the judgement."

72,1,"I had my last drink on the 31st January.

Today marks two months of sobriety.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my second period of sobriety. I was sober for about 140 days last year and I got complacent. I thought I could have just one drink.

&amp;#x200B;

Oops! Wow, oops is an understatement.

&amp;#x200B;

One drink towards the end of last year led me to hitting that slippery slope. Yeah it got me. I had to find out for myself that drinking any amount of alcohol is not good for me. I cannot moderate my drinking. That's it. I'm acknowledging it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have learned that having none is better than having one.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few days of February were difficult. I mean really tough. There was fear. There was guilt. There was shame. I went to bed, I crawled under those sheets and I white-knuckled it for several days.  I learned about ""kindling"". I'm not going to lie, reading about that scared the wits out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Kindling is the body having an ever more powerful reaction to withdrawl. I don't want that in my life. I  do not want to be a burden on others as a result of my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone has difficulties to deal with. Mine are mine to deal with. I'm sure that you, dear reader, have yours too. Whatever they happen to be, I'll share this with you... No problem has ever been made easier by drinking.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I'm getting my act together. Writing is one of my ways of coping with my situation. I am trying to be kind to myself. I know that others are in a more difficult condition than I am. I've been saddened and fearful of recent global events. I've cried. I've been emotional. I did not drink.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also prayed. I know... Its not everyone's thing. My faith is my own. I'm what some would call an ""Agnostic"". I believe in a higher power. I'm not sure exactly what it is. It could be an omnipotent being, it could be that the higher power is our collective consciousness. I think I was praying to the goodness of humanity. I was praying to all of us; all pulling together to give ourselves and our neighbours  greater serenity, peace and contentment in our lives. There is no contentment in a hangover.

&amp;#x200B;

Alcohol is part of my past and I want it to stay there. I do not want it ruining my present. I do not want it to ruin my future. I'm going to overcome my fears and my doubts and I will keep moving forward with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Love to you all!

&amp;#x200B;

I Will Not Drink With You Today"
73,1,"I‚Äôm sad and afraid that I will get this virus and die. I can‚Äôt see the point in taking care of myself, taking a shower, eating right. The only reason I haven‚Äôt drank is because I‚Äôm afraid it will hurt my chances of survival if I get the virus. Everyone I talk to about these feelings tells me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel that way‚Äù or ‚Äújust think positive‚Äù and its the most invalidating and dismissive response. I just pray my husband doesn‚Äôt die, as he is the better parent and has his shit together! I‚Äôm so afraid and I just don‚Äôt know what to do with myself at all. I‚Äôm just watching the hours go by and I feel like I can‚Äôt share these feelings with anyone. So I came over here. I‚Äôm sorry to bring you down and that‚Äôs not my intention. I just need to get through today."
74,1,"I have had the bottle in my trunk for a week. I have not drank. Initially just having it made me feel better, but I sit around day dreaming of beer, wondering if I could handle moderation. I keep bringing up drinking during this pandemic around my friends and wife. It makes them super uncomfortable, I cant bring it up anymore. I am looking for an excuse at this point. I cant find a lot of reasons not to drink at this point other than the fact that I could go back to the liter a day vodka habit."
75,1,"I've been sober for six days. Today was the hardest. The company I work for just put everyone but members of management on unemployment (I am a manager, btw) and we were all at work for the last day to clean up the place for when we reopen. My boss is the best guy I know. Fantastic person, boss, leader, all around good guy. He hasn't drank since December, but knows other people still do, so he brought up a couple of cases of Corona (I know, haha) for people to drink while we worked and ate pizza and stuff. It was so hard to not have one or fifteen. But I didn't. I did not drink. And it made me mad. It made me jittery. It made me anxious. But I did. Not. Drink."
76,1,"I always heard people talking about how drinking has made them lose friends and relationships, or mess things up with their families. I always imagined it to be big dramatic events like you see in the movies or read about in books. You know, like making a drunken scene at a friends wedding, your friends having to carry you home for the 50th time or passing out at your kids soccer game. I guess it‚Äôs kinda like thinking that being an alcoholic only means driving drunk, getting in fights, falling down in the street, missing work, etc. 

I started looking at my own life and realizing that while I‚Äôve never directly lost a friend or relationship because of an alcohol related event, but instead of a series of choosing alcohol over other people, deciding not to see friends because I wanted to drink alone and just not being fully there for my friends. I haven‚Äôt lost relationships because I was drunk, but instead of what alcohol turns me into.. an anxiety ridden unhappy inconsistent mess. 

I‚Äôm a closet drinker, so if you asked my estranged friends or ex‚Äôs if I was an alcoholic, they‚Äôd say no, but they‚Äôd probably say I wasn‚Äôt a very good friend or partner."

During the 101 days sober i have:

Retaken my licens. I can now legaly drive cars. 

Hade a weekend with my wife whitout kids. Awsome!!

And on day 100 i got a car. Not a fancy car, but still a car. For those who knows cars, an opel (vauxhall) zafira. Its 18 years old, but i can take my wife and kids on small trips now. 


We are arguing a lot less now days. Im happier, my wife is happier and my kids are really happy. 
And soon the baby comes to. Just 7 more weeks. 

The only thing i miss from drinking is the fzz when opening a beer. You cant get the same fzz whit a can of coke. But its ok. 

Now i will keep celebraiting with my wife. Some fast food in these corona times and some coke. 

Stay sober!!

79,1,"I (22M) am 1.5 years sober from alcohol but I am frustrated I seem to get addicted to everything I turn to. From alcohol, to drugs, to escorts, to porn, video games, etc  

I've had to stop drugs, seeing escorts, watching porn and playing video games. 

While I have stayed away from those things for more than a year, I am frustrated that I just can't seem to moderate anything. My brain doesn't understand the concept of moderation. I think it's my all or nothing personality.

My latest addiction is running/exercising, which isn't too bad.

But sometimes I just get so frustrated that I get addicted to everything. Does anyone else feel the same way ?"

I actually cried and stomped my feet like a child ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I knew I was being ridiculous but just couldn‚Äôt help the overwhelming emotions. Felt like a war between my logical and irrational mind. One side steadily affirming alcohol would only add to my problems - while the other side was screaming for immediate gratification. Glad I stuck it out. 
I can honestly say the difference has been unreal. I have seen a positive change in my mental heath, parenting, and ability to complete goals/tasks. But genuinely, actually having some hope for the future takes the cake. There‚Äôs some light ahead. Things don‚Äôt seem so bleak and unachievable. I don‚Äôt feel as if I‚Äôm stuck in a perpetual cycle, my existence chained to alcohol. Finally starting to feel alittle free...

82,1,"Hi, I'm new here so I hope this follows the rules.  


My mental health has not been great, and since I've been WFH for the last month, I've been alone in my thoughts. What really has sucked in my position with alcohol recently is that I have a great relationship with some local brewers, and I get a lot of free/cheap beer. Well, instead of saving this for special occasions, I've just been consuming it all. At least 2 beers a day for the last month. It's tanked my mental health and I've realized that I need to get my mental health back into an acceptable place.

So, for the time being, I'm done with alcohol. My social life tends to revolve around bars and breweries, so I think the quarantining will help me reestablish an okay relationship with drinking and in the future trying to lean away from that. It might be forever, and it might be temporary. Who knows, but I want to have a good relationship with alcohol. If I can't, I'll know.

So, for now and for a while, IWNDWYT"

I realized this was not helping me with my anxiety and my overall mental health so I decided to stop completely for the month of April but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll suffer from alcohol withdrawals.

Fortunately, I didn't get sick and I didn't argue with any of them, but I did get drunk enough to ramble on about things that I wish I hadn't. I don't even remember a lot of what was said and now I wonder if they all even like me or just put up with my shit. 

Back to day 1."
98,1,"So, this is the first week in probably 10 years I've gone without any alcohol. It started simply because the doctor said my liver numbers were a little high. He wanted me to cut back for 6 weeks and have the blood work done again. 

I decided to use this time and really try to better myself. Stop drinking, eat a little better and maybe exercise a bit. 7 days in and it has already been crazy! Without alcohol and just walking/jogging daily for the length of an episode of Tiger King (just finished today; She definitely killed him), I already feel so much better. So much so that a 6 week break may not really be what I needed. Maybe it's a complete lifestyle change. 

Now, I know we're all here for different reasons and whatnot. I never really had a big problem with alcohol in the past. Just enjoyed scotch and wine while living a sedentary life these past couple of years. I'm not saying I won't ever drink again, but this past sober week was been amazing. I' sleep better, have more energy, long weight and just feel a sense of accomplishment like I'm actually doing something productive during this ""working"" from home time. 

My 6 weeks for the doctor is the first week of May, but if we are still stuck at home, I see no reason to hop off this train. As shitty as the world seems, life feels pretty good right now. 

Thanks for listening. I just wanted to share this with someone"
99,1,"I havent been at work for 2 weeks because of the virus, despite others continuing to work. Regrettably, I used this as an excuse to dive back into the bottle head first. I probably should be at work, or at the very least, use this time for healing and growing. Anxiety is my trigger. I drink to turn down the volume. I've known this for years now, why have I not addressed this seriously?
This hurts, I feel so weak. I hate facing reality after making poor decisions influenced by alcohol, my anxiety is uncontrollable. I'm not looking forward to returning to work and facing that. This drug really has a strong grip on my mind. I'm ready for another few months of sobriety at least. I can usually stay sober for 6 months or so until being tricked into drinking again, I would love to last longer.

The good news is this isn't my first attempt and I know things will get better. I want to handle things differently this time, I hate ending up back in the same position. An alcohol-free network may be what I need. People who understand. My friends and family do not, luckily my GF is an angel and understands (also does not drink).

Thanks for letting me vent a bit. I'm feeling good about this attempt."
100,1,"I‚Äôve read 3 quitting alcohol related books now:

Alcohol Explained by William Porter

A Naked Mind by Annie Grace

And most recently:

Tired Of Thinking About Drinking by Belle Robertson.

The latter is the best of the 3 for me and really hit home the hardest. I was never a ‚Äòbottle of vodka with breakfast‚Äô type drinker. I am your general problem drinker. 3-4 beers every night, sometimes I would add wine to the mix too.

Belle Robertson caters for that kind of drinker and TOTAD really opened my eyes to why I‚Äôm like I am - she‚Äôs a very similar drinker to me.

I don‚Äôt ever see this book mentioned around here so thought it might help a few of you. It‚Äôs currently pretty cheap on Amazon (kindle version)."

104,1,"I went from too much booze Friday/Saturday nights, like standard party drinkers to a full fledged, multi day benders drunk. All after my wife cheated on, then divorced me.  Broken heart, broken ego, broken home - it all broke me and I found a solace at the bottom of an empty bottle.  I fully realized and accepted booze is not for me.  Big life positive right there.  

Anyway...  Sleeping has been a problem for me for years and years.  My issue is going to sleep.  Let me rephrase that, my issue *used to be* falling asleep!  Somewhere around the 20-day mark my sleep started to get better. Now I'm finding myself going to bed, because I'm sleepy and I want to.  In the past, for many years I would have to go to bed because the clock said so.  

So here I am, 44 days sober, I went to bed last night just because I was sleepy. And I woke up refreshed!  This is so different guys, I can't even put it into words.  

So clearly, even when I was ""just"" a Friday and Saturday night boozer, I was totally fucking up my sleep.  My sleep rhythms, my circadian rhythm.  A bit of googling around and talking to some close friends, and much to my surprise, it's not the least bit abnormal.  Screw your sleep up two nights in a row, and it will take you quite a few nights for your body to get back to normal.  And of course when I was drinking three, four, five days a week, and sometimes going on bendors, omg, my sleep was atrocious.

This is such a pleasant surprise for me, I had to share with you guys!  I'm going to say since I was about 30, I had decided that I was just a crappy sleeper, and it is what it is.  It's not! It's fucking alcohol!  **And that means there is actually isomething I can do about my sleep, and I'm already doing it!**

105,1,This is my first post here I just left treatment yesterday I have 41 days sober today due to the corona virus all meetings in my area are shut down does anyone have any information for online meetings I can participate in?
106,1,"Hi Everyone,

I quit drinking one year ago today with the help of this subreddit. The emotional baggage that came with giving up drinking was immense, and those first few days were spent empathizing with everyone else going through this struggle. It's been a roller coaster of a year, but I have emotions again and I'm genuinely excited to connect with new people (as difficult as that is for me) in my life. I feel more patient and have a much greater sense of appreciation for the things I can't control in life. Things aren't perfect, but they DEFINITELY aren't what they were. I've stopped comparing myself to other people - they may not have gone through the same things as me - their success doesn't look the same as mine and that's ok. 

If you want to stop also, begin seeing yourself as someone who can beat this - someone who isn't controlled by this. When you re-conceive your sense of self outside of the drink, you can be free. My life is immeasurably better, thanks everyone and stay strong! You have all given me strength and I hope to give you some too."

109,1,"Long Post Warning:

I've been lurking this sub for years, don't think I've ever posted.  I'm a 23 y/o college student, I've known my drinking is a problem since I was 18.  After going away to college fall of 2015 I quickly developed a 10+ drink a day habit, almost daily, 9 months out of the year.  I was taking adderall in large doses every day, vaping constantly, eating poorly, and drinking every night.  I've been to 2 outpatient courses, one after passing out in front of a bar and the other after a DUI.  I still continued to drink.  It was fun the first year.  Then I failed out of school, lost my friends, started drinking heavier.  I managed to work my way back into school while continuing to drink, I'm currently a junior and plan to graduate next spring.   

I started having hip pain April of 2019, it didn't go away after a month of PT so I had an MRI done.  At the age of 22 I was diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of both hips, and signs around my knees as well.  I had never heard of this, I didn't realize how this would affect me.  After speaking with an orthopedic surgeon I was told both of my hips are collapsing due to a fatty buildup in my blood, preventing my femurs from receiving blood.  After being honest about my drinking, my doctor told me that is the most likely cause.  I had surgery on my right hip to try to stop the deterioration, I don't think it worked.  I quit drinking for 5 months after I found out about this problem, but started again after my surgery.  I still need a total hip replacement done on my left hip (and maybe my right).  My surgeon wants to wait as long as possible before doing this as I'm way too young for hip replacements.  My mobility has gotten progressively worst over the past year as my femurs continue to collapse.  I can't run, jump, hike, stairs hurt, and I have a bad limp.  Some days I can barely walk.  Every step I take is painful, I honestly can't remember what it feels like to move without pain.  I'm 23 with the mobility of an 80 year old man.  I still continue to drink knowing that this can and will spread to my other joints and they will collapse if it does.  

I know I need to quit, I quit for 5 months before so I know I can do it.  I've quit taking adderall, quit vaping, I'm trying to eat better.  Sometimes I'll go a week+ without drinking but I can't seem to quit for good.  It's hard living in a college town where I've built so many drinking habbits, and I only have 1 year left so I don't want to move somewhere new until I graduate.

It's truly amazing how I can be in so much pain from a disease caused by my drinking, and continue to drink when I know it will get worse and spread throughout my body.

Please don't think that health problems due to alcohol only come later in life.  It's easy to read a post like this and think ""that guy got unlucky but something like this won't happen to me, I'll quit before I develop health issues"" but unfortunately there's no telling when alcohol will ruin your life.  This past year has been one giant blur, I still can't believe this is happening to me.  I used to be healthy, happy, smart, I had good friends, I have a great family, I don't even know how this happened.  All of a sudden I'm a shell of who I used to be.  This isn't supposed to happen to a 23 years old.  I will never have the healthy body I once did.

I realize the hypocrisy when I say to seek help and get this under control before it's too late, but if this post inspires even one person to get sober then it's well worth it.  Thanks for reading."

113,1,"I‚Äôve been lurking in this subreddit for years but things have only gotten worse. Long story short, I‚Äôve had the love of my life the past 3 years but I was too fucked up to really cherish her. I started drinking at 18 and gained a good 50lbs since then from binging. Over the years, after nights of getting way too drunk, I feel like I‚Äôve developed a type of psychosis from alcohol and I don‚Äôt even feel myself anymore, anxiety and depression has skyrocketed since then. I even wound up in a mental hospital after my mom called an ambulance after I binged and mutilated myself with music on full blast.

I can‚Äôt even stress how much I regret it, but a few nights I would get so drunk to the point where I don‚Äôt even remember it and it is all just a blur to me, but I called the love of my life some nasty names and even beat her and ended up in jail. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I had no prior record and I was a really good kid that got decent grades, but I have a long history of abuse and alcoholism in the family and I even won a huge court settlement from getting molested in high school by my wrestling coach. Which brings me to my next point. 

I‚Äôve been trying to make things work and beat my addiction, but she ended up resenting me and told me she moved on in February (which was right after our anniversary and her birthday), and sent me pictures of another guy. I ended up blocking her because I couldn‚Äôt take the pain and finally called it quits, because she‚Äôs been trying to distance herself from me while I was doing community service and she has a protective order on her that we‚Äôve been trying to modify from the court. I tried to forget about her for a month until I broke down in the middle of Utah while I was trying to pick up my old elementary school friend from Colorado after his fianc√© cheated on him, so we could both start a new life. 

She never forgot about all the times I got drunk and stupid, but I fell back into love with her when I showed up at her doorstep on my way back from Denver. It was only because we put her on the spot, because she has no feelings of affection or intimacy after that. She already made it clear she moved on and is seeing another guy, but she‚Äôs still coming over to my house because I‚Äôm paying her generously as a housekeeper with the court money I got from being molested in high school. I‚Äôm basically funding her cigarette and tattoo addiction when she‚Äôs a 19 year old but it made me happy enough just to see her.

But tonight, I got tired of her storming out after asking for money; she obviously doesn‚Äôt care about me as a person anymore. I got so blinded by jealousy, rage, love, and depression that I showed up at her house. Her car wasn‚Äôt there, so I figured she was out with that guy. I literally waited and stalked her despite there being a restraining order on us (which was really dumb), but I didn‚Äôt care because I needed to see her. When she finally pulled up at her house, she was shocked and told me to go home, but not until after she asked for her money from housekeeping. If she was my friend, (which she tries to claim), she wouldn‚Äôt use me for my money and cigarettes and help me when I‚Äôm hurting so bad. But I guess I can‚Äôt really blame her after all of the horrible things I did while I was drunk. 

Now I‚Äôm attending domestic violences classes appointed by the court and I‚Äôm not even technically allowed to see her even though she has been the love of my life for years. I know I have mental issues and drinking has only exacerbated everything, but now I‚Äôm only happy when I‚Äôm drunk which is when I can forget about her. I know I‚Äôm being used and she doesn‚Äôt even want me touching her anymore, but I feel like I‚Äôm going to drink myself to death if she‚Äôs gone from my life."
114,1,"Well made it to day 4! I haven't had any cravings really so that's a win. But some of the withdrawals were tough. Really had to force myself to eat and when I did I felt like vomiting half the time, never did though!

The other major symptoms ive had is both exhaustion and difficulty sleeping which had me feeling like a zombie. 

Last night I got a solid 6 hours though which is better. Today I still feel a bit groggy, but it feels closer to ""I didn't get quite enough sleep"" groggy and not crazy withdrawals groggy. 

The girl has a product shoot tomorrow, bottle of wine which we'd normally drink afterward, obviously I'm not doing that so it'll be the day she learns I'm quitting. Shouldnt be an issue just feels weird to bring up but that's something I'll get used to I'm sure. She doesn't drink much at all though, maybe a drink or two a week. Usually just when she video chats with her friends. 

Ya know when this was over I thought I still might have the social beer occasionally, at the birthday party or on Friday with my father but at this point that has zero appeal to me. Maybe much later on I could handle that but right now I don't even want to touch the stuff whatsoever. 

Overall starting to feel better. Still got a bit of haze and I'm not sure my appetite is quite back yet but think I'll be able to throw back a sandwich or something soon. 

Thanks for reading, and I will certainly not drink with you tonight."
115,1,"I am WFH with our two young children (2 &amp; 4) and my husband is essentially laid off (no work). I was in a very good place... long stretches of sobriety.  But the ability to just be home and drink whenever took me down.

I was drinking at all times of the day, even in the morning.  I was also abusing my husband's prescription medication to prolong my drinking ability.  My 4 year old starting asking me if i was ""drinking wine again.""

What the fuck.  No matter what happens during this virus and after, drinking has only made the situation worse.  BUT...

After a night of not sleeping, and drinking most of what we had left to try and sleep, I realized unless I wanted to keep doing this without any support or accountability, I was going to have to tell my spouse. There was an absolute impending doom feeling... that was I was going to kill myself, lose my job, or worse... be the exact drunk parent my parents were to me, to my kids.

I went into our room at 7 am and he awoke suddenly and knew immediately something was wrong. He asked me if I was hurt, or if I cheated on him (????).  And I said....""I am not doing well.  I can't drink anymore.""  And I told him everything and cried for a very long time.

And instead of judging me or asking a lot of questions he simply said ""I am so glad you told me, you shouldn't have to feel this way.  I wish you'd told me a long time ago it was so bad. I always thought maybe something wasn't right.  When this is all over we will find something that works for you \[therapy\]. I will get the alcohol out of house ASAP.""

I feel like a million lbs have been lifted off of my chest.  My secret is no longer a secret.  And telling my secret has set me free.

117,1,"Just attended a meeting via zoom. Only five of us there. After everyone had a chance to share (some double dipping), I tried to share 3 times but others spoke over me each time (all business matters like getting more time on zoom and sending money electronically). Next I tried raising my hand. I was ignored. I finally asked if everyone could see me. They said yes. I understand that I'm new and these women have been meeting together for a long times, however, it is my understanding that AA is open to all -- not just the oldtimers. It took courage just to show up as a newly sober person. It took more courage to share. Being ignored was discouraging. Have others had experiences like this in AA? If so, did you go back or find another form of support? Thanks for your insights. I'm bummed out, but I will not drink with you today."
118,1,"I only experience true joy when I'm drunk these days. I'm afraid it will kill my social life. When I'm not drinking I just want to be alone and not see anyone. Even when I'm at home doing nothing I feel so bored if I'm not drinking, and I usually end up going to bed early because nothing sounds fun. Wish I could say I was better before I started drinking, but I really wasn't. Alcohol allowed me to get out of my shell and actually be a semi outgoing person, but then I started to abuse it and rely on it.

Even if I were to go and hangout with friends, they'd most likely still be drinking, and I don't think I could be around and not drink too. I know I need to change. I've drank almost every night the past two and a half years, and partied hard on most weekends. I also have no self control when it comes to drinking. I don't think it possible for me to have that happy medium when it comes to drinking. Even if I can go a few days without drinking, the weekend comes around and I pick up a bottle, and then I'm drinking for two weeks straight again. When I'm just drinking by myself, especially on work nights, I don't get too hammered, just enough to enjoy myself, but I know it's a problem when I rely on it every night. When I'm partying I can't pace myself at all. I'm drinking until the alcohol's gone or I'm black out drunk, and when I do get that drunk I can't even remember most of the night, so what's the point? 

Well, even if it does turn me into a social recluse, I know it's better for my health in the long run, and hopefully in time I'll be strong enough to get over it and have a social life again. At least right now I have no choice but to stay in and do nothing lol. So here it goes, time to get my shit together."
119,1,"Hi friends, lurker here.

Like many of the other posts around, this is my billionth Day 2.

Backstory for my current bender:   My dog Zeeba, the love of my life, my longest relationship, my soulmate, got diagnosed with cancer a year ago. As a single introvert with depression and anxiety, this dog was my everything. Last year was the hardest year of my 32 years. I gave her the best last few months she could have hoped for. We went camping a bunch, played with friends, ate til we were stupid, and she helped me choose my next girl, Birdie. The 3 of us lived pretty happily together for 2 months. Zeeba finally let me know she was ready to go on a Friday morning, and the next day, October 5th, she went to sleep in my arms. Up until that day I had been sober for 2 months, and I haven't been sober since. This was the most painful loss I have ever experienced. When she got diagnosed, it triggered the worst depressive episode I've ever had. I'm still trying to crawl out of the hole.

I kept justifying my drinking, saying I could have a week to grieve and drink. Then it turned into weeks, then months. I was heavily committed to bodybuilding, but injured myself around Thanksgiving so I wasn't able to train with the same intensity. So that only added more to my depression. Then I got sick in February (flu? corona? it was bad, I'm still recovering 6 weeks later). So being sick added even more to my depression, and drinking. I haven't been consistent with working out since December so I have lost a lot of the progress that I worked so hard for. I have been suicidal off and on for months. I was also enrolled in school. I ended up withdrawing from the semester to reduce as many stressors as I could, because if I didn't, I would have hurt myself. That was 2 days before covid shut down my school. For the first week or so I felt great, like a huge weight had lifted.  But the past week the suicidal thoughts crept back in.  

Monday I hit a new low for myself.  I was missing Zeeba, and angry for no clear reason. I started drinking while still on the clock (I work from home), and just got angrier and angrier. I ended up taking it out on Birdie, telling her I hate her, hurting her. I locked her out in my shed for hours so I wouldn't have to look at her.  I finally let her back in late to feed her.  She was so afraid of me she wouldn't eat and she ended up sleeping in the bathroom.  How could I hurt a dog who loves me unconditionally? what's worse is I'm vegan ffs.  Vegans typically don't hurt animals.

When I woke up yesterday morning, remembering what I had done, I swore that was the end of alcohol for me. I have been spoiling the hell out of Birdie since, out of guilt.  She's fine, I mostly just scared her.  So today is Day 2 and I pray to the Universe that it sticks this time.  I cooked myself some healthy meals yesterday, had some yogi detox tea at night, read in bed before going to sleep.  I woke up early today and did some yoga before work. I told myself I'm a fucking bodybuilder and to act like it, so I am going to do a workout today.  And take Birdie for the best hike of her life. 

Thanks for reading, we got this."
120,1,"And it's sole mission is to take everything from you and then take you. Let's live! Off to work, IWNDWYT!"
121,1,This is really hard. I picked the wrong time to start drinking again. It's not so bad when you have an office to go to all day then you just have to get through a few hours to bed time. Working from home makes that strategy a little more difficult. I don't have that time in the office to kill off part of the day and keep alcohol out of my mind.
122,1,Happy. That‚Äôs all.
124,1,"And I sat there telling myself that I shouldn't drink for about 3 mins. I turned around to leave, sat there another 5 mins... and I left.  I dumped the 1/4 of my 1.75 liter Bacardi down the drain last night, but I hated myself for doing that. I just have to get 1 day under my belt. Then I can make it 2. Damn this addiction life sucks ass so much. I've been drunk everyday since March 8. If I can make it about 5 hrs, ittl be 24 hrs alcohol free."
125,1,Day one again. But feeling positive!!
126,1,"Spent 3 days in bed. I can't stand this anymore and I'm motivated at the moment. I am worried about the future though. How do sober people relax after a tough day? My field of work is often grueling and mentally exhausting  (not that I ever needed that excuse to drink. I used get even more hammered when I had a boring easy job.)

 How do you deal with stress, especially on friday night, after work?? I imagine myself in the future, after very stressful fast paced week, feeling like I will really want to drink and cave in. This is pretty much why I have failed at staying abstinent in the past."

129,1,"Being stuck inside and isolated is causing me to feel somewhat depressed. Not going to work is making me feel pretty bored..  Work was giving me a way to resist drinking..  spent most of my day there and by the time I got home I was too tired to even think about drinking.  Now I just have all day everyday to think.. and often I find my thoughts turning to drinking.
i gave in last night ...  i feel horrible for my lack of will power..  The intense self hate I feel now makes me want to turn to drinking again today even though I know that wont help."
130,1,"If I had reached out yesterday before I picked up, I would have avoided drinking. Even something as simple as posting here and venting about my day would have helped. Some days, in early recovery, I can feel a mindset come on when I think about drinking, and I know deep down I'm going to stop at the liquor store on the way home. Any advice on how to direct that energy to positive control? About a month ago I had to go to medical detox because I couldn't function off the sauce. Not headed back that way anytime soon, but I dont want to drink at all. Trying to get over the hump."
131,1,"I'm at 18 months today, and it feels fucking great. I'm in the US, so my celebration options are pretty limited to in-the-home activities.

135,1,"I properly stopped six weeks back, but had a one night binge at the end of February.  So March was my first sober month in 25 years. I had a week or two here and there, but no months.  I'm really happy to get a month under my belt.

Today, the wife and kid went to the in-laws house for two nights.  In my decade-plus of marriage, I haven't *not* drank three bottles of wine on a night when they were away.  It's just what I did. I went to the grocery store tonight, got my dinner, and some food for tomorrow and that's it. No temptation, nothing in the house to tempt me.  I just have to enjoy the evening to myself.  

It feels really weird, but I got it. 

I'm really glad I subscribed to this sub however far back that I did, because I think it was that final push I needed to get properly sober.

Thanks!"
136,1,"One year ago ( and after several successful but intermittent individual months off drinking) I decided to take the leap and go for a full year. I figured starting on April Fools would give me the excuse of quitting whenever because ‚ÄòHa! Me? Quit drinking??‚Äô 
I had been drinking pretty much every day for the last ten years and wanted to stop for awhile but just couldn‚Äôt cobble the will together. 

But after several white knuckle months it seemed to stick. Found new coping mechanisms and better habits. In this same time I started a small business with my partner, finished out our third year living in a camper, saw the start of construction on our home, got engaged, and now live in the middle of a apocalyptic pandemic as we completely restructure our business. All while not drinking!
Even though I don‚Äôt participate here much, this sub has provided lots of insight and encouragement. 
Thanks everyone. IWNDWYT"
137,1,"Hey good morning everyone. 

Quick note to say a sincere thank you for 3 years sober. (Today is exactly 3 years, badge is always weirdly off a day or two)

These have been difficult, painful, trying, and yet still BEST years of my life. 

If you are just getting started know that it gets more manageable, and more importantly, you‚Äôll eventually see the benefits. 

At this point I could never ever imagine drinking again. But I keep coming back here.  1. To try to help the few folks I can connect with, in any small way.  2. Sobriety is that important to me and to you that checking in with you all is beyond worth it. 

I owe this community a lot. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. 

Let‚Äôs keep going.

139,1,"Just woke up and starting Day 3 of being sober. Feel a little intimidated with the veteran quitters in the sub but I think I am going to need a little external support if I am going to make this stick. 

* Side note: I used KilltheCan.org to stop using chewing tobacco after 14 years. September of this year will be 5 years of zero nicotine of any form. 

Anyway, had a scary health issue on March 2nd; was admitted to the ER and diagnosed with blood clots in my right legs and pulmonary embolisms in my lungs. I‚Äôm 36 and active; I thought I was healthy despite my considerable daily abuse of alcohol. 

Hit rock bottom fighting with my wife 4 days ago. Using alcohol to handle stress and cope with being bored while this COVID craziness looms. 

My wife drinks too, and probably too much but not anywhere near I did. I told her Monday morning I was done and I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. Thing is, she had know idea how much closet drinking I was doing out of sight. If she knew that, she‚Äôd definitely think I would fail. 

Anyway, using my known ability to quit tobacco as my motivation here. 

Withdrawal symptoms seem to be getter better for which I am thankful. Spent all Monday and Tuesday morning with cold sweats, stomach discomfort, and let‚Äôs just say many trips to use the bathroom. Dealing with a little insomnia now and not sure if that‚Äôs normal... maybe got an hour of sleep last night; thankful I am teleworking today. 

Thanks for letting me share. Here‚Äôs to Day #3."
140,1,"I drank again. I've been messing up life for over 10 years.

I've been to AA for years. I was using this group to cope. Then got cocky. I know I'll feel like shit for a day or two and then the idea will come back. That I can handle it. That I'm cured. It's ridiculous. It's horrific. I'm going to go to rehab. I hope it works."

143,1,"Good morning! I just wanted to share this with someone as I‚Äôm a bit lonely, I think we all are. I don‚Äôt have a lot of people in my life, I don‚Äôt go to AA or support groups, I was more of a spontaneous quitter than someone who wrestled with quitting and relapsed and tried again and again. I never had any desire to stop or saw any reason to, until one day I just did. It‚Äôs still been hard;m, early sobriety being the worst part. Oooof the feelings! But this quarantine has been getting to me. Like I said, I‚Äôm usually alone anyways, I work from home, don‚Äôt have a car, but I love to go see concerts, go on trips, thrifting, antiquing, other things I enjoyed that gave me some social interaction and satisfaction with the obscene amount of cash I saved from. It poisoning myself. Anyways, I‚Äôve been feeling really cooped up and frustrated.  I know we all are, but I was pretty unphased at first. I like solitude and enjoy doing things alone, but the anxiety and loneliness is starting to get to me. I‚Äôve been tempted to drink. I know it‚Äôs just to fill the void left by the lack of doing the fulfilling things I love, seeing the few friends I have, seeing my family, and also seeing what feels like everyone on social media drink at 11 am and romanticize alcohol, having ads for wine delivered to your door pop up on social media, etc etc. I know I just want some stress relief and to tune out of everything that‚Äôs going on, to feel numb and blissful and happy. And I know that drinking and using would only create a bigger void, make me feel horrible and guilty, cause me extreme stress and sadness, but fuck if the little devil on my shoulder isn‚Äôt trying to tell me a few glasses of wine or a joint won‚Äôt kill me, it‚Äôll make me feel better! I deserve it after being almost a year sober, I deserve it dealing with the quarantine, I deserve it for working so hard. I know it‚Äôs all bullshit, but it‚Äôs weird being sucked back into this backwards ass way of thinking. I guess I‚Äôm just feeling desperate and anxious and cooped up. But again we all are. Anyways here‚Äôs to the next two weeks sober af, and then a whole year sober, no matter what the alcohol monster in my mind says! IWNDWYT"

145,1,"I just woke up from the most awful and vivid drinking dream I have ever had. I still feel nauseous and my headache is just starting to subside. 

Now, I've been struggling quite a bit lately. For the first time in several months I have found myself  tempted by the vodka bottles at the grocery store; the only place I have been in the past 2 and a half weeks. The thoughts, you know THOSE ones, have been strong. ""You can have just one. This is a stressful time and literally everyone is drinking right now."" When I saw those bottles the other day it felt like I had to restrain myself from grabbing one and putting it in my cart. 

Anyway, back to the dream. Everyone was drinking in my dream. We were out roaming dark streets and people were walking around pouring liquor into people's mouths and it was a big strange celebration. I kept saying, ""No, I don't drink"" but people were pressuring me anyway. A guy from my SMART group was hosting a party so we went to his house. In the dream he had a girlfriend and in real life he is married. I kept saying, ""I thought they were married!"" like reality was trying to seep in.
We sat down and he told me I could drink in moderation and that he had been doing this successfully; that all this abstinence shit we learned about wasn't even true! So I decided I could have one wine spritzer type drink which I sipped carefully. But soon after I opened up my bag and there a bunch of little vodka bottles in it. They had just appeared and I didn't drink them but saved them for later. We decided to go home. Then I became violently ill- worse than real life detox sick, but similar. I woke up from the dream gagging with a pounding head. There was more but other people's dreams tend not to be interesting for others, so I won't bore you if you made it this far.

This was honestly the dream I needed to have. I needed a reminder of how poisonous alcohol really is and what would most likely happen if I had ""just one glass of wine"". All of the sudden, there would be several bottles of vodka out of nowhere and I would end up extremely ill. Maybe my subconscious was looking out for me this time. I know a lot of us are struggling right now. Stay the path everyone!  I definitely will not drink with you today!"

150,1,"Hi all,  
I recently joined this sub as I finally would like to finish my ""adventure"" with that crazy substance.  
I'm mainly getting drunk on the weekends. My work won't allow me to be under influence on any psychoactive substances, so luckily for me I didn't had many opportunities to get drunk during the week.  


I definitely didn't reach the bottom at any point. If I'm alcoholics, than I'm high functional one.  
My issue is that I drink without thinking. There is no ""enough"" at most occasions.   
I realized... Even though I drink once a week, I drink more than average person.   


But the most important factor is that alcohol is stopping me with my grow as a human.  
This is I decided to cut it out.  


For the last 2 days, I was fighting with myself - should I go to the shop or not. I decided not to go, however thoughts about alcohol were with me all day long. This is when I seriously started to read posts in this sub. This is particularly tough, as at the moment I'm at lockdown at home due to obvious reason.   


Here I am."

Bars are closed which just leaves me to drinking at home but even at home it's the same thing. I scared myself a couple days ago after a night of binge drinking in my room. At least I know I won't have to go out if I'm experiencing withdrawals. I'm also taking an indefinite break with weed so I'm in for a wild ride but I feel like I can handle it as long as I stay open, honest, and active in spaces like this and others."

It's 3am. I simply can't stop thinking about it. I got some gruesome news about my daughter, in an assisted living, and my schizophrenic grown son almost got arrested yesterday. I have a bad case of the ""Poor me...poor me...pour me a drink""....I know other people have it a lot worse than me. I am grateful for this sub, and sobriety. I decided to make sourdough bread,  to distract myself, and for the first time in three years, I actually though about drinking the hooch off my starter! And like a fool, I started smoking again. I had three ""emergency"" packs stashed, and I'm blowing through them. (Emergency packs...that's an addict mentality for you.) And of course, the Nicotine has me all jacked up. If I get in that car...I'm done. So, say a prayer for me. I hate to be such a drag. My sister has 22 years, my mom does, too. Why am I such a loser at this? As a nurse, I know the dynamics of my addiction is screwing with my head, but there's a REAL part of me that's feeding into it. Big time. I just didn't expect it to be so soon. If you pray, please pray for me. Too many people need me, to not screw this up. Especially me. God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference. Godspeed, my sober friends...."
155,1,"I have been drinking probably 15 to 20 drinks a day for several years plus. Never arrested, no DUIs, no violence. I‚Äôm a 67 yo female so no youngster. Every time I went to my doc, everything was okay. I could drink a 6 pack, bottle of wine plus various size bottles of liquor every fricking day. Then I had a Covid scare and decided I needed to stop. My stomach was a wreck and doctor said I had pancreatitis. I woke up every morning in pain, nauseous, dry heaving etc. I said that‚Äôs it. I want to live. 

So I stopped drinking and immediately went into withdrawal. I drank every day, all day and never was drunk. My spouse didn‚Äôt know how much I was drinking. Bottles hidden all over the place. I had some Valium so that helped the first night, but I was jerking around, sweating, dry heaving etc and I thought, this isn‚Äôt working. The next day, I didn‚Äôt know what to do - shelter in place plus I was in no condition to drive. I finally went next door to my trusted neighbors and said I need to borrow a bottle of wine. This was last Friday. I came home shaking and drank it. I immediately felt better but still in withdrawal. Went back the next day, said I needed another bottle of wine. Brought that home, drank it throughout the day and kept most of the worst of the withdrawal at bay. Next day was Saturday. My dry heaves were gone but still shaking. Went next door in the afternoon again and said, I need a beer. They gave me a beer and I drank it down. Then I had a second. Then I said I think I‚Äôm okay now and thanked them. I went to the corner store and got some Natty Lights which taste like beer water. I drank two of those. Could now somewhat sleep at night. I was really starting to appreciate how much alcohol I had been drinking for years. So on Sunday, I had 4 Light Beers spread over the day. The shaking stopped. Monday, I had 2 Light Beers and my appetite greatly improved. All my calories had been alcohol. I slept last night for the first time in about a week. Tuesday late this morning, I had my last Light Beer. My pancreatitis is subsiding and my food intake has been phenomenal. 

That‚Äôs it folks. It‚Äôs not worth it. I don‚Äôt care how great your tolerance is. It was the withdrawal that scared me to death. Tonight I am 10 hours sober and no beer in the house. IWNDTWY"
156,1,"Been working on the road, got in the habit of drinking a couple beers at the end of the day after having been sober for the first couple months this year. Actually picked it back up a couple weeks before I left when I went out with some co-workers but now it's become a daily thing.

Had a couple ***drunks*** since I've been out of town and the last one (Saturday night) wasn't fun at all, being in quarantine and whatnot. So I told my coworkers/housemates I'm quitting entirely until we're out of quarantine (hopefully longer but I'm trying to set short term goals).

One other guy here doesn't drink so it's cool to have someone on the same page as me. Another coworker tried offering me a beer a couple times because his drinking buddy (our boss) went home over the weekend so I guess he's lonely (haha). I turned it down, which was really tough for about 1 or 2 minutes but I didn't really think about it after that.

Last 2 days were kind of hellish mentally and physically but tonight I went out for my bedtime cigarette and noticed I felt a lot more peaceful. I think turning the beer down helped bring about that sense of inner peace as it put action behind my decision.

Anyways, it's almost 3 AM here and I've been dicking around online for like 2 hours. Gonna try and get a couple more hours of sleep before work tomorrow. Just thought I'd share.

Thanks for your support!

159,1,"I work in a grocery store. In the meat department. The past three weeks have been HELL. 70 hour work weeks, rude customers , being yelled at spit on, coughed on and totally disrespected by uncivilized human beings thinking the end is near.  
Finally I broke down last week and bought a bottle of wine. Had a glass one night, finished off the bottle the next night. Next day bought a 12 pack. Lasted 2 days. Next day bought a bottle of tequila, 2 days gone. 
I went on a week long bender and I'm so fucking ashamed. It happened FAST and I'm so surprised how quickly bad habits can come back! I did not drink today and I will not drink tomorrow. I won't let those 2 months of sobriety be erased because I fucked up for a week. Back on the wagon for me."

161,1,"In my line of work I have frequent exposure to alcoholics. In the last few months I‚Äôve had a few but one case in particular really stuck with me. 

40 yo male came in after vomiting blood at home. No other medical history. No other signs of liver failure or alcoholism on assessment. He reported drinking a 6 pack a night high abv beer for the last 6 or 7 years. This man was successful with two kids at home. EGD was done to determine the source of the bleed ...ruptured esophageal varices. Banding them was successful in stopping the bleed but there‚Äôs no cure for a failing liver. After two weeks in the icu he died. Intubated for the last 14 days of his life. He was unable to say goodbye to his kids or his wife. 40 years old. 

I‚Äôve seen people die from various causes and I‚Äôd choose any of them over the death from alcoholism. Patients are so swollen they can‚Äôt walk. Their minds are mush from years of essential vitamin deficiencies. They have multiple addictions to substances used combat their psychological pain. The most heartbreaking reality is there are few if any family or friends to support them in their last days. 

Younger end stage alcoholic admissions are becoming frequent rather than an exception. It‚Äôs sad and terrifying at the same time. 

With my history these patients hit the hardest and prove sobriety is 100% worth all the work that it takes to maintain. Hopefully this provides some motivation to someone to take the night off."

165,1,"50 (actually 51) days ago I posted in this sub wondering if I really needed to quit drinking.  I was in the middle of a day of post-drinking anxiety, but I wasn't sure if I would be able to do it.  

I was really happy to realize today that it has been over 50 days since that post.  Because that was the last time I drank!!  Haven't had a sip since.

I am mostly a social drinker, so the quarantine has taken away some of my opportunities for temptation. However, the house I'm staying in has tons of wine, and as much as I want to drink it, I haven't.  I don't plan on drinking again anytime soon.  The world may be in chaos right now and I have been struggling with anxiety and motivation, but I'm proud of this."
166,1,"I am sure the answer to this question is pretty simple, but I am wondering if other people have problems with just one kind of alcohol? For me, it‚Äôs wine. I don‚Äôt crave any other kind of alcohol, and I haven‚Äôt had bad nights (save for a few) on other types of alcohol. And it‚Äôs the only drink I miss. Is it just because I am so used to choosing wine over beer or spirits? Like a dependence kind of thing? To clarify, I have loved wine since the moment I tried it, particularly red wine."

172,1,"In this time of crisis I'm facing everything that AA teaches us to deal with head on.  At a time like this I see it as an opportunity for growth and strength but also at the most delicate when I could relapse.  At this point I have 23 days of absolute sobriety, and almost 60 days of abstinence from alcohol (there was an incident involving pot).  I've been putting in work on my 4th step for a little over a month and it's been difficult to sit with the thoughts that came along.

Since the outbreak and especially quarantine, I've been thinking about my ex a lot.  We ended on pretty bad terms and reaching out at this delicate state even just to check on her would be compromising to my sobriety.  She's not the kind of person who waits a very long time to start a new relationship, and to know she's been in quarantine with someone else would send me for a tail spin, and I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't do anything rash.  As such, I've been cleaning more and found some clothes of hers.  I boxed them up, went to the post office and sent them to her apartment yesterday.  Tomorrow is the earliest I could expect to hear from her if I do.  This was something I went over with my sponsor and he agreed it was the right thing to do albeit how she decides to respond is a result of her own personal hang-ups, but that if I do feel like drinking after it all goes down to first, call him, and second, remember what's at stake and that I've come too far to throw away everything I've learned.  I spent all of February in rehab and went to meetings every day leading up to the quarantine.

My alcoholism took flight during that relationship.  It was abusive on multiple levels (never physical), and no doubt left us both emotionally scarred.  I would hate to admit she was toxic, but I have to accept that she was.  It's why I can't reach out, and it's why I can't allow that to make me relapse.  It goes without saying that there are some resentments from that.  Just because you put something from pen to paper doesn't change anything over night and I can't ignore the duality - the fact that I still harbor feelings, and the fact that I dislike her as a person for what I went through.  I honestly did not know how to cope with something I never dealt with and drinking was always the quickest and most efficient way to deal with it, if only for a short time.

So now I sit here trying to get through this Zoom meeting though it's not really doing much for me.  I'm fighting the impulse to throw it all away."
173,1,"I drank 2 energy drinks last night that really spiked my anxiety. I was 3-4 days sober but gave in and drank to calm my nerves. My first lesson from this relapse is I need to find a healthier way to calm my anxiety as well as keeping an eye on my diet to prevent anxiety spikes in the first place.

Luckily today was one of those days where I did not have a hangover. I definitely felt tired but after grabbing some fast food and taking a nap I was good to go and managed to get to work on cleaning my room. 

I'm just thankful that this wasn't a complete waste of a day and I'm using this as motivation to keep pushing forward!"
174,1,"I know everyone is going through their own living hell right now. It makes me so appreciate the blessings I have but also makes me so scared of what is to come! That lying Lucy voice is working hard on me and trying to get me to drink! I know she is lying and I will not listen no matter how loud she gets!! This is the time to stand strong together!!

I want to thank first and foremost all the healthcare people on the front lines for putting their lives on the line fighting the invisible foe everyday!! You are real heros in this fight against this ferocious invisible demon!! There are other heros like all the pharmacy people, the workers that get things shipped to us, the grocery store workers, delivery drivers and everyone in the necessary places that remain open! You all are the heros that America is made of !! I wish everyone sobriety, sanity, safety and health in this time! xo"
175,1,Alcohol isn't destroying my life but I know I drink more than I should and when I do drink it's always with the intention to get completely drunk. Now with this social distancing order sitting at my computer and drinking seems like the only logical thing my brain can think to do. I am considered essential but I don't work with the public so I will still be working all week but my weekends I can't go anywhere or do anything. For me drinking has seemed to be the only way to turn off my brain and not be left alone with my thoughts and now with all this being alone with my thoughts is all there is. I really don't have a problem not drinking during the week due to working 50+ hours a week it's really on the weekend but in one weekend I'll drink as much as a normal person would drink in a month. The way this week has been going too I'm already thinking about drinking this weekend and it's only Tuesday and I really don't feel like I have the strength to resist the urge to drink through this all my friends are all busy with their families during all of this and my family isn't close at all so I don't really have anyone to turn to in times like this.
176,1,"I decided to take the plunge on January 1st and committed to not drinking for the entire month. It wasn't always easy but I learned so much about myself, maintained healthy habits and routines, and improved many areas of my life including work, relationships, finances, health, and my general well-being . I felt super clear headed, lost weight and was able to better understand what I wanted out of life. 

Fast forward to February and, while more conscious of my behavior, quickly fell back into poor habits and choices. I was able to moderate for awhile but as most of y'all know alcohol is a slippery slope. March continued much the same with short periods of time when I was able to abstain and stick my head above the water but as a whole proceeded much like February - slipping back into alcoholic tendencies and daily drinking.

I've read ""This Naked Mind"" a couple times and follow Annie Grace on Youtube. I wholeheartedly relate to her thoughts regarding making a firm commitment such as ""I don't / I'm not drinking"" and sticking to it. This is so much easier than needing to constantly negotiate with yourself if you will drink today and how much. Decision fatigue is a real thing. 

With all of this is mind and after drinking every day this past weekend, I'm ready to recommit and attempt a dry April. It feels like the best time as any being home and sheltered in place for the foreseeable future. Feel free to join me :) I'd love to have an accountability buddy if any one wants one. IWNDWYT"
177,1,"We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day.

For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at: US - Night/Early Morning Europe - Morning Asia and Australia - Evening/Night A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

OK I give up right now! I wanted to post some 'feel good' type songs here today. But I just cannot make it all jive perfectly, even after spending an hour listening to songs so I could be sure they were appropriate for our group! All this, while The Husband &amp; I were reminiscing our insane past with April Fool's Day pranks on each other. Both adult sons texted to share their memories of their favorites. The 3 winners were 1. the year I had my arm casted at work &amp; my supervisor called The Husband to warn him I was coming home with a broken arm &amp; may need some TLC! #2 the year that The Husband had the younger kid, 16 at the time, pretend to be hallucinating on the living room floor at our home in Coronado when I got home from work. ""The floor is the door."" he had the kid say among other crazy stuff. But for me the best one was when we were trying to get pregnant with that 2nd boy, who if he'd been born first would most def be an only child... The Husband had to submit a sperm sample for testing reasons in our quest for another child. He'd turned it in about noon that day. I had one of my Nurse friends I worked with at Kaiser Permanente, call my Husband to inform him the sample was not ample enough &amp; he needed to bring in another one by 1500 the next day! I will try one more time to post a happy, upbeat song &amp; then I'm going to the bed! Love you all!

180,1,"So lately my drinking has turned into basically everyday. It's anywhere from 4-7 drinks. Always at night. Never in the daytime unless I'm on vacation or something like that. The thing is, even though I know it's a problem rationally, it doesn't feel like a problem. I totally separate my work from drinking. I have no desire to be buzzed during the day, regardless of what I'm doing. I'm not counting the seconds until I can have a drink or anything like that. It's just that I like it as a way to relax and it lets me shut my overactive mind off for awhile. It's really therapeutic for me.

Then there's social drinking which is another problem. Everyone in my world drinks. Not like we're all just drinking buddies or something. They're my friends from highschool and college, some of whom I've known since before I even had my first beer. My girlfriend also drinks and it's a big part of our lifestyle.

I don't know I guess the issue is giving up drinking entirely would be a massive challenge both personally and socially, and I haven't had any issues because of alcohol. I never drive drunk, I never get hangovers, I never get into fights with people, it's always been a net positive for me. I know I'm not the healthiest I could possibly be but shit my weight's fine and I don't have any health issues.

I'm just starting to feel like I'm dependent on alcohol and that feels wrong to me but that's basically it. There's no real reason for me to quit and it would be such a major task that I'm not really sure if it's worth it."
181,1,"I hope this post is alright to share here. I'd really love some advice, perspective, anything.

I'm not a huge drinker, but I'm a regular drinker. I have 1-2 drinks more days than not. A day of not having a drink in the evening is a real commitment. Even days when I say I'm not going to have a drink, it's as if it just blank out and have one anyway. It's almost like I'm not making the conscious decision to do it, it just do it on autopilot.

I want to stop doing this and I just don't know where to start, or what to do. I think most people would say my drinking is a non issue, but the fact that I can't seem to stop when I want to says otherwise."
182,1,"Back to double digits! Woot woot! 

As some of you might have read in some of my posts, I was in medical detox last week. 

I‚Äôve found myself getting a little paranoid, however. When I was in the hospital, they did bloodwork and an ultrasound of my abdomen to check my pancreas, liver, gallbladder, etc. 

My bloodwork came back good, but the liver enzymes were a little high because of my drinking. I asked the doctor about the ultrasound, and he said everything looked fine; I just had a ‚Äúlittle bit of a fatty liver.‚Äù 

I have a follow-up with my PCP tomorrow and am nervous. If something was seriously wrong with my liver, would the doc at the hospital have mentioned it to me? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being paranoid or what....."
183,1,"First shop since our countries lockdown. The supermarket is handling it reasonably well, one in one out, tape on the floor two meters apart etc. I shop at what is considered the fancier market in my town and I am on greeting terms with the owners (lol, never went there on my benders) so, its reasonably full, everyone is being more or less civil, good to see the owners in the floor helping keep order and the staff seem in reasonable spirits. So far so good.

But at the end the line for the checkouts were staggered and perpendicular to normal to keep distances and let one at a time, with a staff member directing. that all made sense and was the most logical way for them to do it, well done.

The kicker was that the line ran right past the quite large wine and beer department (no liquour stores allowed open), so I had 20 minutes to watch..... Nearly every single person already had wine or beer in their trolley by the time they lined up,fair enough, i get it. But about every 30 seconds someone would leave the line (keeping their place) and grab some more.... Then wait 5 mins and go and grab some more. Aaaaaaand just as their postion in line was progressing past that dept.... Two more bottles just in case. 

I totally totally get it. I'm just so so fucking grateful it wasnt me.

187,1,"Hi!

Well technically it's past midnight already so you could say it's already the date.  And for some reason before bed I always feel inspired to write this stuff.  So here goes nothing.

As per the title:  today marks 6 years and 6 months without a drink or a drug.   Maybe not in the beginning, but since then, I hardly ever think about drinking.  I mean, life is just so much better without it... it just doesn't even enter my mind.  And before it was just the opposite!  Before I got sober, I couldn't imagine life without it!  Who would have known?

And not only that, but on most days I don't even really think about sobriety.  It's just natural to me now.  But I don't know.  Sometimes that's a good thing, life moves on... but sometimes it's a good thing to stop and remember, too.  Remember what happened, remember what it used to be like, and take a moment to appreciate just how far I've come.

Lord knows it's not always easy.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I really don't.  But there's just something about life, man.  There's just something so tremendously beautiful about it.  Again, don't get me wrong, I don't feel like that every day, at every moment.  No way.  But I can't shake it... I just can't.

I'm growing, I'm learning... sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.  But I feel like the most important battle has already been won, or should I say, lost.  I surrendered.  I stopped trying to run the show.  I started trusting.  Life has me in its arms.  Or you could call it God.  My HP.  The Universe.  Love.  You choose.  But its got me.

Sometimes doubt comes back in. And with everyone around struggling so hard, sometimes it just seems like the only way to live.  But these last couple of days I've been thinking about this poem.  I ask myself, ""Can I simply trust?  Can I simply float?  Is it OK to just let go, relax, enjoy life and be at peace?""

And in this poem I find the answer:

&gt;‚ÄúListen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.‚Äù

189,1,"I'm in early sobriety. In my previous efforts to stop drinking, I'd get to the 2 week mark and think ""oh, you've done super-well. You can probably have a drink now, just one or two."" Ha! 

I'm now at 2 weeks and I've felt those twinges of ""Go ahead, you've done 2 weeks, what would the harm be?"" But this time it's different: I am conscious of it happening.

190,1,"I‚Äôve always liked to drink to feel confident and social because of my anxiety in social situations. Never had an off switch and have lost friends and never had a successful romantic relationship. I‚Äôve stopped socializing. It‚Äôs too much work. Working hard at my job, picking up a bottle on the way home to sit on my back porch and drink the whole bottle was so perfect. I‚Äôd pass out, wake up in the wee hours horrified and feeling ridiculous. I would feel normal later in the day and repeat my behavior. I‚Äôm two days sober, And headed for more. I want more out of life. I want... to want ...friends and to start dating. I feel the alcohol has been taking my soul leaving me dull and lifeless. It makes it easy to continue drinking because I‚Äôm not hurting anyone. This is because it‚Äôs only alcohol and me! This not who I want to date !!!! Anyone leaning toward isolation with or without Coronavirus?"
191,1,"I used to be one of those people that'd request a new badge every week or so.  Sometimes every 48 hours.  One time, I lasted six months, and it was the most horrible six months of my life.  I cracked eventually.  As of 11/30/18, I was having trouble staying sober long enough to not be hungover for a doctor's appointment to talk about psychiatric medication.  Ended up with a diagnosis (bipolar 2) and a couple of medications to try.  

The trial and error process of treating bipolar with medication can be hell and the side-effects sometimes seem worse than the illness (I still don't feel like I've regained my creative side fully).  I've tried six medications in the last year and a half and I've quit five of them.  The impulsive, erratic, and irresponsible person who used to binge drink is (surprise surprise) also the kind of person who chronically goes noncompliant. I've caused myself some unnecessary grief and pain and experienced worse withdrawal than I ever did with alcohol.

That said, at this moment, I am stable.  I have not touched a drink since I began taking Lamictal in March 2019.  I've been as depressed and frantic as I've ever been in the past year, but alcohol no longer feels like it would help, or that it'd be something I'd enjoy.  It's like a switch I didn't even know I had was turned off overnight.  (Weirdly, I also quit a 25-year nail-biting habit without trying.)  That's the one thing that's kept me taking Lamictal despite my extreme frustration with medication.  It did something for me that I couldn't do for myself.

I have so much work left to do on myself.  I'm still reeling from a bad depressive episode last month, and the current situation is taking its toll as well.  But I quit - I sometimes feel guilty for taking the ""easy way"" - and I don't think I'll find myself drinking again.  

Obviously not promoting a one-size-fits-all solution here.  But, if I look at drinking as a symptom of my illness, I'd say that seeking treatment helped.

Anyway, that's my reflections on my year.  IWNDWYT."

You guys were a huge help the first day.  I had so much anxiety about how I was feeling, I still do but it's not as bad as the first day.

Thank you all for what you do"

194,1,"I‚Äôve been sober for 14 days. COVID-19 should‚Äôve been the excuse to get sober, easily. For so many reasons.

a) I live with my parents. They‚Äôre in their 60‚Äôs. My mom has asthma. They‚Äôre right in the danger zone. I shouldn‚Äôt even be interacting with anyone, let alone going to a liquor store.

b) I‚Äôve been under Coronavirus house arrest, haven‚Äôt even been outside for a week. And the one time I go out I go right to the store? Even after two weeks sober? I can‚Äôt understand what happened, in the quarter-mile walk to the liquor store I told myself so many times that I shouldn‚Äôt be doing this, I can always turn around, turn around and go home, no-one even has to know I started going. But I did and now I‚Äôm drunk and full of useless remorse. 

I live with my parents because I drink. Because I lost my job and my SO and I can‚Äôt hold anything down. And I‚Äôm willing to risk their safety for alcohol even after everything they‚Äôve done for me because I‚Äôm an alcoholic? I‚Äôm not a good person. I‚Äôm weak and selfish and a piece of shit.

I‚Äôm posting this to help anyone else. If you feel like drinking, just don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a 30 minute rush and then hours of self loathing, and days of clawing your self esteem back.

195,1,"Denial. Anger. Bargaining. Depression. Acceptance.

This acronym is often associated with the 5 stages of grief when a loved one dies.

But today I‚Äôm realizing it can just as well apply to recovery from alcohol.

In the early days there was plenty of denial. I don‚Äôt have a problem. It‚Äôs not my fault. It‚Äôs not that bad. My step dad is worse!

There was a lot of anger. Why me?! Why can‚Äôt I drink like a normal person?! It‚Äôs all Dylan‚Äôs fault (a guy I liked, long story, not entirely relevant to this post)!!

I know I bargained. Just one! One more day and then I‚Äôm done. One more bottle and never again. Just a couple sips, I promise, please.

And definitely long periods of depression. This sucks. Nothing in my life will ever be good again. I will never feel happiness.

But at some point we come to the 5th stage of grieving: acceptance. This is my life. I‚Äôm an alcoholic, and I can‚Äôt change that.

I‚Äôm not big on AA, but I still love the Serenity Prayer. ‚ÄúMay I have the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.‚Äù

And while we may reach acceptance, it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre done with grieving. Ive been more active in this sub the past couple days and I‚Äôve been trying to pinpoint why, exactly. And I think, if I‚Äôm being honest with myself, I‚Äôve slipped back into a depression of sorts. I‚Äôm not bummed about it. It won‚Äôt last forever, and it‚Äôs not the end of the world.

I‚Äôm happy to have a community willing to be here for me, and willing to help share and grow and heal with me.

199,1,"The urge to drink is stronger in times of crisis.

The drink demon just loves to take advantage during difficult times. It's that voice that keeps whispering. I know it well.

I hate it. Mine has a name. It's called the Toxic Intrusive Arsehole. Also known as Tia. 

During times of stress it needs to put back in its box. I know that can be difficult to do.

I stand up. I say out loud ""I will not drink with you today"". I repeat it several times. Making that commitment to myself eases the struggle. My voice is louder than that of the manipulative siren trying to crash me onto the rocks.

The act of saying the words gives me control of the situation. It gives me power over it. I am the master here. Not that devious booze monster.

I can do this. You can do this. Take control and put Tia back in its box."

A year and a half ago I met my gf who's been the best thing to happen to me in so long. I've always had a good head on my shoulders but a drink in my hand as well, when I met her I became motivated to change and better my money and health condition. 

We moved in together and I told myself that I would stop everything for the new job coming up..that never happened. Shes doesnt give me hell for much. I know she knows I'm just waiting to get back on the road in April with a full license and be a little free again and not so cooped up at home.

Managed get back on my feet and improve my health while also managing to find a better sales job that I could be set for life with. I hit it big in the winter of 2019 but blew it all away on booze practically..so at the moment..I'm working on regaining everything. 

My main question is..why can't I find the reason or will to stop drinking when I feel that everything is going okay? Half the time I feel like I don't want to be with my gf and I just want to rebuild on my own but I feel that would be a waste of a relationship.. would love some help plz thanks üëç"

212,1,"Hi, everyone!  I've been absent for awhile, but it's because things have been going rather well.  

My partner and I recently accepted two foster sons into our home.  They're exactly the motivation I needed to be a better person.  Their eyes... when they look at you and hope you're going to be different than the foster parents before you... they say everything I need to hear. I look at them and remember how much of a positive influence my sober grandfather was on me.

Work has been improving.  I'm being promoted soon.  I lost about 20 lbs and then flat-lined.  I expect to lose some more this summer.  I just haven't been that active in Coronavirus captivity.  I do worry occasionally about what an extended lock-down might do to my willpower, but it hasn't been an issue so far.  We've been having a lot of family game nights and movie nights.

**I'm not sure if this will help anyone, but my life was in a major slump before I decided to stop drinking again.  My career wasn't advancing.  I wasn't being challenged.  I wasn't growing as a person.  I woke up one morning and decided I needed a change.  I never thought I wanted kids, but suddenly thought maybe kids were what had been missing in my life.  I signed up for fostering classes through a local adoption/fostering agency.  It was a 10-week class.  During that time, I was able to network with the instructors.  One of the instructors happened to be the Manager of the adoption/fostering agency.  I let her know that I was looking for work and would love to help do more for the cause.  She hired me on as a Receptionist, with clear expectations that I would grow within the organization.  It was well below my pay grade, but it was a field I had never worked in before - it was something new and exciting.  It's been three months, and I'm now being promoted to Case Planner.  I now live and breathe fostering/adoption - at home and at work.  I found purpose in life.  I feel like I'm making a difference in the world.  I was terrified, after giving up the career I had built in Human Resources.  It paid off.  I hope this inspires some of you to make that leap and find a cause to get behind.  My purpose is helping me maintain my sobriety.  I feel like I matter again.**"
213,1,"I was doing pretty swell guys. I was in school. I was busy. I was on my meds. I hadn't had a drink since 2019. My psychiatrist recommended intensive outpatient treatment and AA, as well as the meds I was already on to help with my alcoholism. But I was feeling pretty confident, so I was okay that I hadn't heard from the scheduling for the intensive outpatient treatment yet. I see my psych doctor once a month. 

Then I met someone. I told him I wasn't interested in a relationship. I didn't let on why because it was none of his business and really I knew it wasn't going to go anywhere because I was so busy with school and kids. But this guy never relented. I was mean to him and he just kept coming back. I straight up told him I have no time for him. I have no time for love. But that's exactly what happened. I fell in love. I started drinking again because I felt left out. And like usual, my drinking snowballed. I turn into a completely different person when I go on benders (I'm sure we all do). He saw that. He knew I was trouble. After just a few short weeks he left. God that hurt. 

That bender just went deeper and hurt more. I ended up in the hospital again. Here I am back on the wagon. I think it's been a week since my last drink. Everything has fallen to the wayside, I dropped out of school, I have no money, the guy crashed up my car because my drunken ass trusted him to drive it even though he had no license, I come out of a several week long drunken stupor to a world in crisis. God this sucks. But hey. I am not going to drink. I am appreciate myself sober. I feel so much better sober.

First 2-3 weeks was horrible anxiety/full body shaking/bad balance on my feet/extreme fatigue.

Here at 30 days anxiety has gotten a little better. Body shaking gone, balance better. Horrible fatigue is still very strong. So tired my eye lids always droopy and I look very hungover.

216,1,"The events that lead to my first day of sobriety are still haunting my brain.  How could I have let this happen?  I've been down this road before.  I had almost a year of sobriety under my belt.  Then I started again.  For myself, that was not the best decision.  It started innocent enough, and I was ""controlling"" it for a bit (the lie I told myself), but it got dangerously out of control pretty fast.  Honestly, I have been doing daily drinking for over a year now.  As this year has progressed, so has the amount I consumed on a daily basis.  And my starting times were getting earlier and earlier.  The final straw was a particularly bad weekend bender.  I was mixing cannabis and beer pretty heavily.  No more.  No more beer.  Or booze of any kind.  And no more cannabis - at least for awhile to clear my head.  I may never go back to moderate cannabis use, but I will probably keep that door open.

Here's the deal - I might have gotten it under control again, but when?  And at what cost to my marriage, relationship with my kids, and relationship with my dad who lives with us.  And my dad, to his credit, has been around the block a few times with this issue and I.  And really, as long as there is alcohol in my system - I am not in control of anything.  The last year, specifically the last three months when everything escalated out of control, has proven that to me.  I am the fly deep into the pitcher plant who keeps thinking ""I'm in control, I got this"" when the reality is I don't.

I want to get healthier.  I don't want my dad or wife to worry about me anymore.  I don't want to hurt anyone, anymore.  My alcohol use is the thing I am most ashamed of in my life.  Period.  If I want to end the cycle of shame and alcohol abuse, I need to use this as a wake up call. 

If you read this, thank you.  I just needed to get some stuff off my chest."
217,1,"Has anyone who has been sober from alcohol noticed any health benefits since quitting? Better skin, weight loss, ect.?"
218,1,"Hope you‚Äôre all staying safe. I have been subbed to r/stopdrinking for a couple years now. Reading people‚Äôs stories has sort of been a fail safe measure to keep me from going overboard with my drinking. Regardless, I still seem to push the envelope and find myself bingeing and losing my footing in this crazy world. One of the things that I have noticed about myself, and maybe some of you have felt to, is that I get this sense of confidence when I‚Äôm drunk that allows me to do things I wouldn‚Äôt normally do sober. Example: singing and dancing. I enjoy having a good couple (12) drinks and singing my heart out and dancing, and I feel great when I do it. But that only happens when my mood and timing lines up right. But I chase that feeling and the confidence it gives me to places that I more often than not end up regretting. 

All of this is to ask, how can I fool myself into believing that the bubbly and fun guy I can be when I‚Äôm drunk is really just a part of me, drunk or sober? What are some things you all do to achieve similar highs while staying sober? I would say IWNDWYT, but I had some Fireball this morning to stave off the hangover.

226,1,"
I‚Äôm an active member of my AA group, and thought I‚Äôd share some of my observations as we‚Äôve amped up zoom meetings across North America specifically. 

I‚Äôm in Toronto, Canada which isn‚Äôt the worst hit but certainly a hot spot for Covid-19 in the province of Ontario. I had my first close connection to a Covid-related death yesterday and it‚Äôs starting to hit close to home. My heart goes out to China, Italy, Spain and the US (especially New York) where they‚Äôre being devastated the most. 

Online meetings 

My group is filled with old timers and it was a bit of an uphill battle to finally get everyone to agree to cancel in person meetings. As attendance dwindled it became clear to me it was unsafe to continue in person meetings despite us taking precautions (we stopped food and coffee service, we spaced chairs 2 meters apart, and plenty of hand sanitizer). Interestingly the smell of the alcohol in it was quite a topic of discussion for many.

When we went into a state of closure in the city of Toronto I immediately invested in learning zoom and as the youngest member of the group, set everything up. This was met with a vast majority of people thanking me and has been largely appreciated. I thought it was important to get ahead of it and I kind of took the liberty of getting it together, but it‚Äôs worked out in the long run. 

I‚Äôve done other online meetings and I find it nearly as useful as in person meetings with the added benefit of convenience and accessibility. 

Mental health

I find that people in recovery are actually pretty well adjusted to this situation. We‚Äôre used to isolating, but we‚Äôre looking at this through a positive lens. The population‚Äôs general anxiety and fear is something we‚Äôre used to living in, under the lash of alcohol. I‚Äôm not afraid, however I‚Äôm privileged enough to be able to self isolate comfortably, and take this health crisis one day at a time.

Not everyone is so fortunate - rent is due tomorrow, the Canadian government‚Äôs stimulus package can‚Äôt be applied for for 7 days and we all don‚Äôt know how bad this is going to get. I‚Äôm thinking of the serenity prayer - grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change - this virus is here, and I cannot change the actions of others. And courage to change the things I can - I can stay home, I can stay positive, I can wash my hands and I can refrain from touching my face. 

Not everyone is in this boat and I can totally understand this adding to people‚Äôs existing anxiety. This is why people who are in a good place like myself need to check in on those struggling even more nowadays. I‚Äôve had more phone calls and FaceTimes then I have had in years. 

Socio-political issues 

In Ontario they decided to keep the liquor stores open and deemed them an essential service to prevent alcoholics from going into withdrawal and flooding the hospital systems. In a way the medical community is saying it‚Äôs better to keep drinking than to quit now. I think this is unfortunately the best bet. I needed medical detox and nearly died a few times. Scary shit, and this is one factor that keeps me from picking up a drink, especially in these times. 

Personal experience

I‚Äôm loving this online community, I‚Äôm using this time to help in any way I can, my fathers company had a treasure trove of PPE‚Äôs stored in their lockup, and we donated these to medical facilities as they‚Äôre in short supply. 

I truly hope and believe we can emerge from this as better people, in the same way that we emerge as better people in recovery.

230,1,"When the shutdown hit, I suddenly found myself out of a job with nothing but time on my hands. So I went on one of the worst benders I‚Äôve ever been on. I would drink until I passed out, wake up, but more alcohol, and drink until I passed out again for 8 days straight. Waking up last Tuesday morning, I read a couple of short poems I had written to friends and found this:

Today I get sober (it‚Äôs been a whole week!)but it would be nice not to slur when I speak, and taco deserves a far better mother, I‚Äôm gonna do this, for both of each other ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

And I resolved to do it. The first few days were extremely difficult, but I never wavered in my resolve. Today I celebrate a full week, which is longer than I‚Äôve gone since September. Quarantine has actually been good, since as a restaurant person I was always surrounded by alcohol all day. Now I‚Äôm just focusing on cooking, reading, exercising, and getting healthy. By the time the restaurants open back up, I‚Äôm hoping to be far enough along to resist the temptation. Either way, it feels amazing to be sober!"

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, yesterday I ***chose*** to break my routine to be super productive, help someone out, stay up late, enjoy myself, and remember all of it. At the expense of being a little groggy in the morning. A small price to pay.

The alternative being not getting half that shit done, not remembering it, and feeling like shit for another 24 hours while very likely restarting the cycle.

This is why I love being sober and kept telling myself during the first couple of days last week that I would remember loving this feeling once I got through it.

I guess I should say the thing. It'll be the first time I've said it, so it feels kinda weird...

233,1,"I got an email from myself yesterday. I sent it via. one of those ""email yourself in the future!"" websites, sometime in March 2019.

In the email, I asked myself if I'd managed to find a better job yet, with a less abusive boss. I asked if my relationship was still making me happy, and if I'd managed to make it a year sober yet. I remember writing those things, it was 7 o'clock in the morning and I was sat in a Morrisons cafe waiting for my shift to start - since when has a year become such a short amount of time?

I found a better job, with a lovely boss. I dropped out of college due to alcoholism in 2016, and now I'm back in one, doing a better degree and getting incredible grades.

Nobody else secured that job for me. Nobody else has written or read my coursework, nobody else has put my life back together again, and nobody else has kept me sober. 

*I* did this. Me, the sad overweight mentally ill alcoholic college dropout failure. *I* am recovering. Slowly, surely, definitely. I'm fucking great, wow. I deserve love and self esteem. Slay, Queen. üëë

235,1,"I am aware there aren't meetings going on right now, but I want to prepare for after the quarantine! I moved to MI from california last August and am having a hard time finding meetings into the Genessee County. 

I am thinking about going to Ann Arbour and Lansing because they are college towns, does anybody know of good meetings around those areas?"
236,1,"I have been struggling with how to manage the feelings of shame, embarrassment, and horror at some of the worst drinking moments of my life, while finally reaching a point where I'm not continuing to have these horrible moments. 

When I say horrible moments, most people have no idea how truly horrible what I've done was, but I think some of you will understand. I'm talking about waking up in the hospital from a night of drinking (that was normal amounts of drinking for everyone else), passing out at a party that everyone else remembers, coming to next to a disgusting person after being blacked out and not knowing who they are or how I got there, coming to surrounded by police and a furious taxi driver with no shoes and no idea what happened. The list goes on, and gets darker. 

But now I'm finally in this moment in my life where I'm not drinking often (a glass of wine maybe) and the people I know have no idea about my past. I think people see me as a pretty responsible, reserved woman, actually. Shocking! I love this new me, and the way people respect me. However, even if they don't know, I know what I used to be and what has happened to me. I feel traumatized, but I don't know how to process that trauma. How can I move forward in a relationship or a deep friendship without alcohol AND without the shame of my past? It's haunting me. 

Do any of you have these same feelings? How do you come to terms with your past self as you become a more sober person? I would love to hear from you guys, the people who really understand what I've been through and how much it can hurt."
237,1,Nice.
238,1,"So I'd abandoned this group in the false belief that I didn't have a problem. I'm now in day two of a terrible hangover after drinking a half a litre of gin. I spent all of yesterday rolling around in bed drenched in sweat trying to pass out so I couldn't feel the pain and today all I can do to not have a panic attack is sit and read my phone.

**Covid19 Rant:** My days are often dictated by fatigue, so in many ways these days aren‚Äôt so different. But oh the noise! The lovely SaintMarge in her home office, SaintBart in his home kindergarden, SaintLisa in her home school... For someone needing hours of silence every day, this is rough.

**Covid19 Silver Lining:** Having the crew at HQ lets us make the most of a very special time in our lives. We challenge eachother, fight, learn, grow, play, love - like any other romantic comedy drama flick.

**Isolation Sanity Saver Tip:** Routine. Get up, get dressed, eat breakfast, brush your teeth. Go to work, take a break, surf SD, work some more - keep the rhythm going!

/u/belindathegreat 

**Covid19 Rant:** My SO got laid off right before the shit hit the fan with this thing. He had loads of interest in his resume and lots of good leads on jobs that were actually better than his old one. Then we started isolating and having shelter in place orders and they all completely dried up over night so here we are trying to make it on my pay alone for who knows how long, quickly burning through our meager savings.

**Covid19 Silver Lining:** I can't believe how I don't even have the smallest desire to drink here. 2 years ago I'd never have believed I'd EVER get to a point of being this over alcohol, especially in an anxious time of global crisis.

**Isolation Sanity Saver Tip:** Through Amazon Prime you can get a 1-week PBS Masterpiece free trial. I'm binging through comforting 18th century costume dramas here.

/u/stratyturd 

**Covid19 Rant:** With stores running low on supplies, I'm finding that my precious la croix is sometimes hard to come by and I am having to settle for lesser alternatives. Dear bubly: add some damn bubbles to your lies. IT'S CALLED BUBLY, NOT MOSTLY FLAT.

**Covid 19 silver lining:** I work from home fulltime already so the transition was not that hard to do. I do miss going out to places and things though.

**isolation sanity saver tip:** I find having movies on in the background during the days are helping keep the monotony at bay. Current household faves are the original star trek movies( KHAAAAAAAAAAAANNN) and marvel.

/u/sfgirlmary 

**Covid19 Rant:** WTF is up with the panic-buying of bathroom tissue? No, seriously‚Äîdo people think this is a stomach virus or something? My brother texted me, ‚ÄúSome people aren‚Äôt shaking hands because of the Coronavirus. I am not shaking hands because everyone is out of toilet paper.‚Äù

**Covid19 Silver Lining:** With little else to do, I have been able to put extra hours into my artwork. I am about to try to learn a new Japanese collage method called chigiri-e.

**Isolation Sanity Saver Tip:** Watching the grace and humor with which others are coping with the situation is helping me reframe it. A painter friend of mine posted on Facebook, ‚ÄúI am no longer calling this a shelter-in-place. I am now an artist-in-residence.‚Äù

/u/SpottedFish 

**Covid19 Silver Lining:** In keeping with the same mentality as I went into sobriety with, I‚Äôm focusing on all the positives only, and keeping peace of mind and equanimity the main priority. I count myself lucky to have had the practice run.

/u/gregnegative 

**Covid19 Rant:** I isolate by nature, which is pretty dangerous for a person in recovery. This makes it far too easy for me to do so, and doesn't really allow for an outlet. I am the only one working at my office, so I'm totally alone at a minimum 9 hours a day. It's not that it makes me want to drink; it's that eventually even my extremely introverted self starts to get mental health issues from this.

**Covid19 Silver Lining:** Remember all that stuff I had no time to do because I kept getting interrupted? Well...

**Isolation Sanity Saver Tip:** Video games. I don't even really need to say more.

245,1,"Day 6 of waking up alcohol free (day 7 of not drinking). 

Something strange I have noticed. I now have leas motivation to do anything. 

When I was drinking before, as the hangover was a-baiting I would get a surge of 'lets get some shit done' and I would have 2-3 hours of being ultra productive.

Now, being hangover free I have absolutely no motivation to do anything at all. Despite getting lots of sleep, eating well etc. I just can't see the point in doing anything (and no Im not depressed). 

Anybody else found this?"
246,1,I won't be drinking today.  I want to be able to enjoy these magnificent birds in all their glory.
247,1,"I easily stopped drinking for three months about a year and a half ago. I felt amazing. I noticed society‚Äôs ability to glamorize alcohol abuse. I‚Äôm a binge drinker. I convinced myself I could moderate and slowly fell back into being drunk on weekends and wasting a day hung over. The last drink was 17 days ago. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the state of things or what, but the urges are much more intense this time. I think I have little distraction (out of work at the moment, virus outbreak and all), and boredom was always a trigger for me. 

I don‚Äôt feel jazzed. I don‚Äôt feel energized. I don‚Äôt feel excited that I‚Äôm over 2 weeks sober. The food and sugar cravings are still intense. I keep hoping the closer I get to 30 days, the better it will be. Each day I think ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôd love to do like everyone else during shelter at home and drink on my porch‚Äù.  

But, I won‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt. So, I‚Äôll push on through with my fizzy water, hot tea, and coffee. IWNDWYT."

249,1,"I'm at day one again, I could really use some kind words because I feel like a failure right now and it's eating at me. I  bought a bottle of my favourite liquor last night for shots because I had already had a few beers and couldn't stop myself. Or didn't stop myself. I don't know. But I bought it and ended up pouring it all down the sink this morning. Which is good, aside from the fact that I wasted 40 bucks that I really needed to hold on to. 

This all happened because my partner brought a six pack home and I didn't stop myself from having a few of those either. I feel shitty asking him not to drink anymore so I can stop but I can't handle having alcohol in our house.

I am spiralling right now. The furthest I've gone without a drink in months is 12 days but that was a while ago and I feel like I'm never going to get a handle on this."
250,1,"Something Governor Cuomo said in one of his many press conferences. It‚Äôs kinda vague and oddly worded...but it really hit home for me. We not only have to gauge the state of the world / our new collective reality of quarantine,  but we also have to gauge ourselves during these crazy times. I am likely off of work for 5 months ( school social worker). Started out the quarantine.. drinking. Same pattern a bottle of wine , throwing out about a glass.. so I can say well at least it was not a whole bottle. Numbing the Boredom, the anxiety, the loneliness.  
Today is day 2 for me and I am officially gauging myself. If I continue to use this pandemic as an excuse to drink everyday.. I will be a full blown alcoholic by the end of this thing. I will emerge bloated and sad.. deep in this addiction, 20 pounds over weight, emotions buried. Yesterday was hard, had to break the pattern, today I am hopeful."
251,1,I heard that quote and wanted to share
252,1,"I think I've finally hit the point where my drinking is an issue. I'm 23 and married and causing issues in our relationship because my wife is disappointed in my drinking habits. I have a hard time staying away from alcohol. I don't even know why I drink. Maybe to cope with stress? I work full time, am doing three degrees at my University, serve in the military and I'm taking more than the normal course load for school right now with law school admissions right around the corner. I guess when I drink, I forget everything and don't feel so overwhelmed. When I get bored at home, I drink and this quarantine has been no help. 

I once again upset my wife last night over the fact I was drinking when I told her I would stop. I went out to buy a few things at the store and saw alcohol and just couldn't ignore it. It's been years since I had a good cry but today I feel like I could at any moment. I'm upset with myself, I'm angry, and I don't know where to begin. I don't want to admit I need help but realistically, I know I do. Thanks for listening."

255,1,"So I guess this is a sort of mental relapse as it comes with all the same guilt, shame and disappointment as a result of my past behaviour."
256,1,"Hello all,

I only joined the page yesterday but I stopped drinking last Tuesday so this is one week sober for me **and** one week no smokes. I couldn't have done it without my fiance by my side. She has been so loving and proud of me every day and I can't thank her enough. We have been together a year and a half and every day she amazes me.   


My physical withdrawal symptoms are down to a dull roar but I always find these next few months I am most likely to relapse. I can get through the hard stuff ok (have before) but once I start feeling good gain and like I have control the sneaky thoughts arrive. 'Just one drink with your buddy, one beer is ok right?' or 'one drag off a smoke, share this one and then it isn't your cigarette right? You are not a smoker if you just share'. But to quote General Akbar from Star Wars 'This situation seems tailored to ensnare us'. Just gotta not drink or smoke, every day, one day at a time."
257,1,"Last night, after 32 days sober, I gave in and drank. I wanted to share the results with you. The kinda sorta good news is that even though I technically drank a lot (400 ml of whiskey quickly in the space of about 90 minutes), I drank less than I usually do. I did not throw up, I did not piss on the floor, I did not break or knock over or drop anything. I didn't even really post anything too embarrassing or crazy on Facebook. All things considered, it was not a disaster.

But there is a kicker and there important considerations:  I purchased the alcohol at 1pm, with the intention to drink at 8pm, because I know from experience that if I start drinking early, I'm just gonna keep drinking and drinking all day. The problem is that I spent most of the day anxiously and uncomfortably checking the time, just waiting for 8pm to get here so I can drink. This is NOT good. Rather than enjoy my day and then drink at night like a ''normal person'', I just kept waiting for the clock to hit 8.  All I could think about was ''nighttime better hurry here so I can drink.'' And guess what? I didn't even make it that far!  By 6:30 PM  I got tired of waiting and started drinking. 90 minutes later, the entire 400 ml of whiskey was consumed, because I always end up drinking fast to get drunk fast and stay drunk.  This proves what I guess I already knew:  I do not have a normal or healthy relationship with alcohol at all.

But wait, there's more. Even though the 400ml of whiskey quickly drunk on a half empty stomach was enough to make me drunk, quite frankly I got the urge to go back out and by more. Yep, I was drunk and I just wanted to buy more to keep the feeling lasting longer. A main reason why I didn't is because the liquor store was already closed by then.  I also slept pretty badly last night, as you can I imagine.  


Sorry for the long post. I guess my only point is that even though my drinking night was not a disaster (nothing broken or dropped, no embarrassing social media posts, no throwing up) I still behaved and acted in a way that proves I have no business consuming alcohol. The fact that all day I could only think about being able to drink.  The fact that I guzzled down 400ml of hard whiskey in just 90 minutes. The fact that I probably would have gone back out to buy more, if the store hadn't closed already.  Sometimes we do not have to hit rock bottom to realize that our relationship with alcohol is just toxic and very unhealthy. Thanks for listening, friends."
258,1,I won‚Äôt be drinking with all of you today
260,1,"I, like so many of you have been struggling during the lockdown. Nothing spikes your urges to drink like a pandemic and the world crumbling around you apparently. Every single night has been a struggle, it feels like I‚Äôm back in the very early days. BUT, I have not caved, and when I wake up I am so happy I didn‚Äôt answer that call. I‚Äôve been sleeping like a rock and I am waking up sober, rested, and ready to go instead of half drunk.,dry mouthed, and full of shame and regret. It‚Äôs simply not worth it to drink, congrats to everybody making it through this, no matter where you are in your journey."
262,1,"I'm 464 days sober and was doing fine before covid-19 hit. Now in lockdown in Scotland, possibly until end of May and I've been thinking of drinking a lot. To be honest, relapse feels almost inevitable and I'm not sure what to do to stay strong and change that mindset. Is anyone else struggling? Thanks"
263,1,"After 2 weeks of self isolation before which I stocked up on hundreds of dollars of booze, I got the call from detox. I had tried to set up an appointment but it generally takes a month to get in.

When I got there I was already going into heavy withdrawal after blowing a .303. This was about 3 hours after my last drink. Their policy was not to medicate until you got down to .100 but by the time I got down to .200 I was shaking out of control with a blood pressure over 170 and they immediately got me with the IV diazepam. It took about 30 mg just to get my blood pressure under 150.

I was almost out of alcohol and if they did not call me I would have gone cold turkey which probably would have been very bad for me.

Tldr: if you are on the fence about cold turkey, tapering or getting medical help, go the medical route."
264,1,"Hi peeps, 

I‚Äôve been using this alcohol tracking app for iOS (not sure if there‚Äôs a non-iOS version out there), maybe it‚Äôs been mentioned here before, but it has helped me monitor how much I‚Äôve been drinking, that is to say, none. 23 days sober and counting.

265,1,"I've been in isolation for a while now, whole country is pretty much locked down. I'm scrounging through my pantry eating what I can find, trying to make things interesting (I've had some strange couscous these last couple days). Imagine on top of the weird diet, almost shitting your pants 5 times a day. You'd burn through your toilet paper in a week! At least my body is able to handle my strange concoctions of sardines on fried mashed potato with veg."
266,1,"I was cooking the other night and was about to serve up and pour myself a pint of water. My girlfriend only had a glass of prosecco on the go, and without thinking I said ""can I get you a proper drink to go with dinner, water or something?""

I've used the term ""proper drink"" many times in my life, but only ever to refer to an alcoholic drink over a soft one. Not anymore. Proper drinks hydrate you and don't leave you feeling sad and groggy.

IWNDWYT."
267,1,"Im not sure how to start this. But here is how my life goes and how my drinking problem is in my life. 

I work in a dry camp for a 2 week period. 14 whole days of work, sleep and eat. Followed by 14 days of freedom, and the capability of doing what ever i want. By day 9 im usually tired of being me, drunk, and not wanting to adult. 

It usually starts on day 1 at the airport. Getting to the airport usually like 6am so we can get on with our lives only leads to the only restaurant in the whole place. Its usually packed. Find your boys at a table and get a couple in you cause its well deserved after that long work haul. On the plane and have another one or 2, get to the lounge and another free one as you wait your connector. Get home hop a cab, check your mail and drop off your stuff. Might be around 2pm maybe a little later. Of course living off of the main street filled with restaurants, bars and places that have some live venues the nights can get entertaining. 

Day 2 Wake up mid morning, go threw your stuff, get some errands done. Talk to your friendly bartenders and let the work luggage go as well. Look at that its now 5pm in come the rest of the regulars and your drinking buddies. Next thing you know its getting dark, and 60,70,90$ deep into beer, just for yourself. Ok time to go you had a good night. 

Day 3 Mid morning again. Get some stuff done, wait till 4pm and go out.

Days 4 - 9  Its too late. That habit is back, it never left. Another set off is gone and thats 2 weeks i wont get back. The money part stings, I can work hard and make it back. But the time is the shitty part. Still not at the beach body. (Sure the ladies love the dad bod, but I see all the booze ive drank.) Im ususaly getting tired and just feel like shit at this point. Not even eating properly. 

Days 10-13 Im able to lean off the beer and get my stuff in order for work. 

Thankfully COVID made its appearance. For me it was a good thing, I have not been infected as of yet. 

But over my last set of days off when i got on the plane and asked for a whiskey on the rocks. I was not even in the mood for one. I just got one out of habit. For some reason whiskey on the rocks seems like a mature and sophisticated thing to do. 

While I was on my days off, I went to the liquor store and bought a 12 pack. It took me about 3 or 4 days to go threw it. Maybe its because i dont have a bartender pushing booze on me. Or staying way to long due to the Fear of missing out. After that i went back again the next time it was 2-3 days. and also bought some larger Quart bottles from indy breweries around. Still impressed with myself for not having gone threw wads of cash yet. I did get a little liberal with my spending as its no where near going out at the bars. 

My real challange is going to be when the world goes back to normal and everything opens up. Now that i know i what its like again to have a clear mind when i get home things are much easier to deal with. Hopefully if things do open up soon and allow me to get out in the city and enjoy it I can get to the rest of my goals."
268,1,"I came here a year ago today to finally get my life back on track. 

There was a hiccup in the fall but I'm celebrating five months this upcoming week. Thanks for all the help and support. This was an essential tool to the first few days of my recovery.

269,1,"Slipped up. Boredom/being homebound allowed it to creep in. Drank 5 pints the other night. Felt horrendous the next morning. However...

Since 1 September I have drank on only 6 occasions.
In fact, I have drank less than 90 units in 7 months. In the weeks leading up to 1 September I was drinking more than that each week.

My periods of sobriety are stretching out.. 50 days, 50 days, 123 days, 63 days..

I recall an interview with Danny Trejo (Machete!), who is now 50 plus years sober. He said he gave up drinking in 1961, and again in 1962, and again in 1963... It takes work. This shit happens. (Check it out on YouTube actually, man is a legend).

So tonight I drank- and I hid it from my loved ones, but tomorrow I‚Äôm gonna start with a level head and with patience. I know it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve tied this, but I am trying!

272,1,"We agreed it was a trial to see how it would go. 

She seemed sane while I was following her instructions. 

I took a day of rest yesterday which she wasn‚Äôt happy about and I came to the conclusion that she isn‚Äôt a good fit. I talked to other AA fellows who had far more moderate sponsorships that sounded like a better fit for me. 

I was trying not to judge her bc it‚Äôs not my job. She had a very boot camp approach and every day she‚Äôd pile on more and more, so that it was beginning to add up to about 6 hours or more per day. I was willing to try it bc I want sobriety and don‚Äôt really know how it works. I was noticing traits about her that suggested she was overbearing and controlling but I was trying not to be judgmental. Plus, on the surface she has a sweet and charming personality. 

I‚Äôm going to vent it here to get it off my chest. 

She was overbearing, controlling, manipulative, condescending, and self absorbed. 

It‚Äôs confusing being in the first days of sobriety with an alcoholic brain. My therapist who is 29 years sober in recovery, says we don‚Äôt like to be told what to do so I decided to stick with her for a couple more days against my better judgment. 

She was pressuring me to read from the book for hours nightly into the wee hours of the morning. I‚Äôm not working so I agreed but it was messing up my sleep cycle which is still not back to normal. 

The last night I read with her I told her I had to go after two hours and she said: let‚Äôs just read these few more pages... and kept me on the phone for another half hour. 

I‚Äôm polite and too accommodating and so I have been a target for narcissists my whole life because almost everyone in my family is one. 

Yesterday, after talking with other AA members and really looking at this I decided it was in my best interest to move on. 

I texted her yesterday and said that I was taking the day to asses my program and her sponsorship. She responded in a way that seemed like she understood. I said we could talk tomorrow (tonight) about it and then shortly after I made my decision. Mind you, we never discussed making her my permanent sponsor. 

So this afternoon I got a message from an elderly lady friend who is all alone with a broken arm and needed some help. I texted the sponsor and explained about the lady needing me and said I didn‚Äôt know what time I‚Äôd be home but that we could talk this week. She texts back that she thought we were going to talk and maybe read again. She had no compassion whatsoever for this poor old lady! She seems like a narcissist. Then seconds later she texts ‚Äúas your sponsor I need to direct you to check in with me.‚Äù wtf? She sent a couple more asking me to check in and another checking in on me. 

All along I felt she was in this for herself but now I think she‚Äôs unstable. It‚Äôs bringing up so many emotions for me and I don‚Äôt need this now. It‚Äôs turning me off to A.A. and making me want to give up. I don‚Äôt want to drink at the moment but who knows what I‚Äôll want in the next moment? 

She happens to have so much in common with narcissists who have traumatised me in the past. 

I‚Äôm not being a victim or self pitying. I know AA has good people. 

I feel angry, manipulated, and insulted that she sees me as such a pushover. It‚Äôs my fault. I treat people with kindness, courtesy and respect because that is how I wish to be treated. The world doesn‚Äôt work that way though and all that does is make me a magnet for sociopaths. 

She just texted me again and I‚Äôll feel these pangs I‚Äôd guilt because I feel sorry for her. She‚Äôs all alone and preying on newbies to have someone to control bc her husband left her. 

I decided it‚Äôs in my best interest to cancel our conversation. I‚Äôm going to text her tomorrow and thank her, tell her that upon careful consideration and consulting fellow A.A. members, I‚Äôve decided we aren‚Äôt a good fit for each other in a sponsorship. 

I want sobriety so badly, I clearly can‚Äôt do it alone, I don‚Äôt want to hurt her, but this is really freaking me out and scaring me off of A.A."

I felt like a pretty bad parent right then. My child's safety was compromised because I was wasted in my living room.

I am lucky because I hadn't developed physical addiction. No withdrawal symptoms. But I had to rewire myself. Drinking was a habit and reward for me. It was the way I unwound, the way I made myself feel ok at parties and work dinners. I felt like I was uninteresting and boring unless I drank. 

Now I feel the opposite. I'm ok being myself sober.

I plan to continue not drinking because I don't see why I would go back. I sometimes miss the warm tingly sensation of having alcohol in me, and I miss some of the cultural rituals, especially with beer and wine. But I did that, and now I can do different things. I like who I am better this way, and I like having this thing that I figured out and changed in myself."

280,1,"I just hit 5 months yesterday. I am happy, and I‚Äôm grateful. Today I got in my 2nd minor car accident in the last 5 months‚Äîboth my fault. Just feeling like an idiot. The negative self talk is creeping in.....you‚Äôre a moron, you suck at driving, why can‚Äôt you do anything right. You don‚Äôt deserve nice things. You ruin everything that you have. This is your karma for how many times you drove drunk. 
I‚Äôm trying to combat it. It would be nice to take a couple shots right now and forget it. But IWNDWYT."
281,1,"I could have easily gotten away with drinking without feeling the real pain of it but I stayed productive and filled up my time other ways. 

Early in the morning I started having thoughts of how I could start drinking at any time. No one would know and I still have time to procrastinate on my work. 

I enjoy morning productivity so I started studying instead, made food, tanned outside, and watched YouTube videos. Halfway through the day I started to feel restlessness kicking in. The last half of the day is always the hardest for me. Then I realized what I wanted to do more than drink was to go for a run after the sun went down. It was just a slightly uncomfortable waiting game of filling up my time until then. 

I didn‚Äôt get upset at myself or overwhelmed for having thoughts and feelings I didn‚Äôt like. I acknowledged them and moved on. 

I studied some more and watched stranger things then went for my run. I came back and walked my cat around the neighborhood in the stroller. Made food, watched more stranger things, and now I‚Äôm about to read a little in bed before going to sleep. 

Glad I worked through the problems instead of giving in to them.

283,1,"I already set a goal to do 145 days without Cannabis on February 15th this year, to at least July 9, 2020. Which would be 18 Days Before my 25th Birthday. Now I am ready to kick booze out. 

I turn 25 on Monday July 27, 2020. 

Now I have set to not drink hopefully rest of my life with the min date set as August 21, 2020. Which falls 25 days after my 25th Birthday which is at 6am on Fri Aug 21. 

If I went 4 weeks easy in 2018, 5 weeks easy in 2019 and 6 weeks easy earlier this year then I should have no problem being able to stop until that min date speaking in short-term terms, in long-term terms I would not like to drink again. 

Wasn't drinking awesome when we were all like 16/17 years old? Maybe even 18/19. 

I'm not a teen anymore, and I have to take Alcohol Use Seriously. 

Nothing ever good comes of it as I fuck my liver up.

284,1,I am watching Strangers Things again - only sober - and it is really like I've never seen it before. So many 'new' things to watch!
285,1,"I saw a post earlier from a person who was celebrating 90 days. I looked on the calendar &amp; realized it almost slipped by me!

Wow!! For a person who could barely get to 30 days (tried at least a dozen times), it feels so surreal to be at this point. 

I did this with my husband. He didn‚Äôt really have a drinking problem; he would just go with the flow &amp; drink when I did. He, too, is celebrating with me today. 

How it progressed &amp; how I did it:

Weeks 1-2: How many times have we all been here? I lost count. The difference this time is that I threw myself into doing so many things, I didn‚Äôt give myself a chance to think about it. I worked extra hard, did extra assignments, did side hustles, etc. I basically became a robot because I didn‚Äôt want to think. I knew from the past, if I started thinking too much it would lead to drinking. I didn‚Äôt look at this sub either because that would get me thinking.

Guess what? It worked! It was so much easier than the other times.

Week 3: I kept going but started feeling down. Of course, feeling down made me think more. This time I took care of myself. I knew my feelings were probably my brain starting to reset so I let myself be down &amp; if I felt like it, ate 3 bowls of ice cream or went to bed early. 

Week 4: The sad feeling started to lift (a little). I still refused to think about drinking. If I did I would distract myself. I have been a runner for almost 2 years so that was a great distraction along with work.

I knew 30 days was coming up &amp; I never managed to make it past that time frame so I was nervous too. 

I also noticed my skin starting to look good &amp; my face was less puffy.

Weeks 5-6: I still tried to pre-occupy myself as much as time went on as I moved away from that date. I started letting myself think about drinking more - with caution. I even started lurking around on this sub again. I didn‚Äôt think about drinking that much. If I did I would be stressed out &amp; would think that it would be great to have a drink. It only happened a couple of times. Distracting myself seemed to be key. 

A weird thing started happening. One big issue I had with drinking is not being able to remember anything - recent things and things from years ago. During this time I had these weird blips where I would be doing something mundane &amp; would remember something that happened when I was younger that I completely forgot about! It was very cool &amp; a little weird.

Weeks 7-8: Pretty much the same as the previous 2 weeks.

Weeks 9-12: My mind started to clear even more. It is a very SLOW process. I still feel a brain fog today but I feel it ever so slightly lifting and you have no idea how motivating that is. 

I am slowly feeling more equipped to handle stressful situations. Sometimes it is frustrating how slow the improvements are. Then I remember that my poor brain and other body parts are furiously repairing damage that I‚Äôve done &amp; I feel thankful. It might be slow, but it‚Äôs happening. 

This is also the time the virus hit. I have to tell you that quarantine &amp; being bored were heavy triggers. But since my mind is a little bit clearer, I am more aware of my power &amp; strength to squelch that annoying little addiction demon when it rears its ugly head &amp; starts trying to persuade me. 

My husband also helps because he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs nice to go into this crazy time with a clear head &amp; no hangovers!‚Äù He is really the best.

My skin looks the best it‚Äôs looked in a long time! 

People always ask about weight - haven‚Äôt lost any! Maybe it‚Äôs all those ice cream bowls I allow myself to have. That‚Äôs cool though - I‚Äôll take a few pounds over hangovers and regret any day. 

Congrats to all of you at 90 Days, more than 90 days &amp; less than 90 days! Keep fighting the good fight!"
286,1,Anyone else ever write themselves notes when they were drinking to remind their sober self of anything they should know from the night before??? I would do that all the times... sometimes the notes were total gibberish. I‚Äôm so glad I wake up to my memories and no longer incoherent notes! IWNDWYT
287,1,"I have been trying to quit drinking for the past week. It has been difficult, but the most difficult part that I cannot seem to get over is falling asleep without drinking. It is 4am right now, and I was trying/should have been asleep a long time ago as I have my dissertation and a research projects due soon. Not drinking has actually been fucking up my academic progress. I made myself a drink earlier just to go to sleep. I do not want to drink any more but it feels like it is the only choice I have. Does anyone else struggle with this too?"
288,1,"I decided to cut alcohol out of my life around March last year. Around the time I stopped, my posion of choice was by far wine. Especially red wine. Dark, red, bold, fruity reds. Particularly shiraz. I was weak for the stuff.


Even though I went months without drinking alcohol, I'd occasionally get the odd wine craving. And being around an open glass of wine would make me immediately feel weak.


I looked to non alcoholic wines to fill the void where red wine once was, and frankly, if you've tried non alcoholic wine, especially non alcoholic red wine, you'd know it's absolutely disgusting.


After a while of trying and being disappointed by shitty NA red wines, I frankly became sick of the taste of the stuff. Somehow, in trying to replace wine, I had become sick of it.


I thought I was over my wine weakness, until a few days ago. My brother had brought his bottles of unfinished reds down to the living room for us to help ourselves to. And I thought, no oh. My weakness. Red wine. Bold. Fruity. Flavourful. None of them were shiraz, but they were close enough. And that's all it took. 


Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough to resist. Even though I thought I was tired of wine... I still missed the taste. It was the thing I loved most of all about drinking wine. It really wasn't about the buzz. I was addicted to the flavour.


So a little later, in private, I snuck a sip of each bottle. 


And honestly? 


It was disgusting.


Ew! I can't believe I had tricked myself into thinking for so long that this stuff was delicious. The damage ran so deep that even after I had stopped drinking, I still thought the stuff was delicious. But having had a sip of these disgusting tasting wines, I failed to see the appeal I had seen before. Seriously, why did I keep going back to that stuff for so long??


I didn't even swallow a few of those sips. I spat them out into the sink and into the toilet. I had made a mess on the toilet seat, getting red wine everywhere, all over the seat and on the wall. And it reminded me that alcohol brought nothing but trouble and inconvenience. It was best to keep the stuff out of my body and out of my life.


It's strange though. Even though I had rediscovered that wine was disgusting, I still felt tempted to have another sip this evening when I opened up the fridge. So I did something a little strange. I opened the bottles and took a sniff. I know it's a bizarre thing to do, but the pungent scent that I had once found so intoxicating and alluring just made me feel nauseous. It made me remember how unpleasant the reality of wine really is. It killed my cravings completely. I screwed the bottles shut and put them back.


Safe to say those bottles are going to sit in my fridge, untouched, until somebody else polishes them off. But I know it won't be me.


IWDWYT."
289,1,"Pretty much what the title says. I'm terribly desperate to stop drinking, but I'm equally as terrified of withdrawal.

I don't know what to do."
290,1,"I started drinking to calm my stress in law school. Socially, then most evenings, then to ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù or cope with basically anything. I live with someone who does the same, which makes stopping hard because there‚Äôs always alcohol in the house. Since the pandemic, I‚Äôve been drinking to cope - with the changes in the world, with the loss of normalcy, with being cooped up 24/7. I had to remind myself yesterday I have other ways to handle the changes besides alcohol. My new mantra is ‚Äújust for today‚Äù thanks to this sub. IWNDWYT"
291,1,"I just had a thought that‚Äôs comical to me. Not only would I alternate stores when buying my wine but I would also make it a point mention that I was having friends over as they were ringing it up. I wasn‚Äôt. I just drank a ton of wine and didn‚Äôt want to ever run out. I‚Äôm sure they were thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah right‚Äù. 

10 days. This afternoon/evening I felt depressed and pouty because I wanted to drink. But I didn‚Äôt!!"
293,1,"I'm on the 2nd day of not drinking. I have quit before but this time feels really hard. I need to quit for my health! I got so overweight everything just HURTS. I have only lost weight when I stopped drinking. Plus I just want to be healthier and face life with energy. 

I knew today was going to be hard. I just hope I can finally give it up for good. I want it to be the last thing on my mind at some point in my life."
294,1,"It's so hard the things that tempt us.  For me, it's a need to connect with someone.  It's pain in my hands from typing.  It's seeing my body has changed, likely, forever due to age.  It's seeing my face changed for the same reasons.  It's that I'm itchy all over and I can't seem to figure out why! My body hurts.  I'm bored!  So many times I've come to this sub and calmly told people to not drink, just to take care of themselves.  How easy I made it seem!  I think drinking must have made me feel very pretty and very loved.  That must have been a big part of it.  And forever young.  Going ahead and making the promise right here and now to not drink with you all tonight.  Maybe time to take my own advice and take a hot shower and cook up something yummy. Right now I just feel hopeless."
295,1,"Last night when my girlfriend fell asleep I went downstairs and had a pint of vodka coke which turned into me drinking the whole bottle,  sleeping all day today and shitting liquid. My problem is not how often I drink, it‚Äôs being unable to stop once I‚Äôve started. Often I will drink Friday night, carry on all of Saturday, and sometimes Sunday too. This has been happening for years, and effectively dominates every weekend of my life. So, I‚Äôm stopping now, before being cooped up in isolation leads me into midweek drinking and even worse benders. I hope I‚Äôm strong enough to carry this through... I can‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm quite nervous. 

Any support and advice is welcome. Cheers (as in thank you!) everybody!"
296,1,"I‚Äôm bored. I‚Äôm thinking about drink more. I‚Äôm walking like a fiend to ward off the boredom, stress, and desire to drink. My life has been pretty low-key since I stopped drinking, but this crisis has just done a number on me. I‚Äôm not going to drink, but I want to put these words out of my mind into the universe to just get it worked out! I‚Äôm not great at posting witty commentary.  This is a rambling, random gathering of words expressing my depression over not being able to just blank out for a bit.  Not a wise choice, but I do miss the ability to do it!  This sub has been great to read when the thoughts creep in. Ok, I‚Äôm almost done with this jumble. Stay strong folks. Drinking is not the answer, it just creates more chaos in an already chaotic situation.  Perhaps I just said that last part for myself as much as you all.  Stay safe, well and healthy. IWNDWYT."
297,1,"I just got home after travelling abroad for 6 months and had a video chat with some family friends. They were saying they can‚Äôt wait for my quarantine to be up so we can have big family style dinners like we used to before I left and get wasted. We‚Äôre all Italian so the whole evening is a proper orchestrated event. Home made wine, food until you can‚Äôt move, and plenty of liquor to wash it down. 

I‚Äôm playing it in my head on how I‚Äôll tell them I‚Äôve decided to stop drinking and I feel like They‚Äôll think it‚Äôs a massive joke. 
What if they get all weird.

Do I really want to quit drinking?
Help."
298,1,I'm thinking I need something to help regulate my moods. I'm in isolation and lost my job and stuck indoors all day due to the mess right now. I feel like I need something because I'm drinking myself to death even more now.
301,1,"It‚Äôs been a week since I‚Äôve had a drop of alcohol and today I really wanted to go out to buy some. I‚Äôm almost done with midterms and was tempted to ‚Äútreat‚Äù myself. 

I paced around my dorm room and eventually had to tell myself out loud, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù even after reading the note I wrote for myself in case I get tempted. Shortly after that, I forced myself to sit down and watch tv, scroll through reddit, etc. I knew I just had to take my mind off the possibility of drinking. 

Luckily, I only had to wait an hour until I got tired and felt like crawling into bed. I‚Äôm currently writing this on my phone. I know a week isn‚Äôt exactly all that long, but I went kind of crazy during spring break and need to watch my diet for my fatty liver anyways (doctor says I gotta weigh 160 and I‚Äôm currently 196, was 228 the beginning of February). I don‚Äôt wanna completely stop drinking, but I do need to seriously cut back. Fortunately, I gave up hard alcohol last October and have lessened the amount I drink in one sitting. But I still do it 2-3 nights a week. And that‚Äôs the last thing I‚Äôve been meaning to change. So far, it seems to be the hardest step.  

Today was a difficult victory, since I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress recently from school and life. Also, my roomate moved out last week so I could day drink without worry of being judged. It‚Äôs been a real struggle. 

Thanks for listening! I just felt like sharing."
302,1," I had thoughts on picking up the bottle again since the lock down started here in Manila on 03/16/2020 maybe I was bored no other outlet aside from work and going to the gym..

But suddenly I asked  myself.."" why stop now?"" . Then I started looking for things to do that does not involve alcohol. I watched home work out videos learned calisthenics and different variations of push ups(doing 100 push ups / and dips a day is quite a bitch but definitely worth it).

listened to tools album in Spotify and how amazing and accurate Danny Carry is. (It was obvious to tell his style  is similar to Neil Perth's .

If you are on quarantine right now and thinking of drinking. Please don't do it. the battle has jusy began.

303,1,"My last drink was am 4 am yesterday after a 3 month relapse. I knew I needed to quit, I got the usual stuff, a snickers bar, some ice tea and got ready to feel a little uncomfortable. Holy shit, I must have drank so much more then I thought this time around. But I started going to costco getting the big gallon handles and wasn't paying attention. Woke up from a nap at 7 pm last night, by 8 I was throwing up. By 9 I was uncontrollably shaking and dry heaving. My roommates could hear me from down the hallway and came in to check. I cant imagine how terrifying it was for them to see me like that. I went to my doctor today and he gave me a 7 day script to detox off of. Even the look in his eyes was of disappointment. I never want to feel so pathetic and hopeless again.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. 

**For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!**

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""Chasing what can't be done is madness. But the base person is unable to do anything else."" --Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations, 5.17

A mind that isn't in control of itself, will be jerked around by external events &amp; unquestioned impulses. This can't be how we'd like tomorrow to go. So we must be aware of that. We must put in place training &amp; habits now to replace ignorance &amp; ill discipline. Only then can we begin to act differently. Only then will we stop seeking the impossible, the short-sighted &amp; the unnecessary. 
This is a loose *translation"" of the Aurelius quote from The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday &amp; Stephen Hanselman.

312,1,"I fucked up an ruined my sobriety (about 14-15 days) on a Sunday before the Monday when they announced all non-essential businesses would be shut down (aka my gym). I was relying on my gym as a routine to keep me sober. During the week, this was what I relied on. I would come home grab a protein shake, head to the gym, come home, eat my dinner, journal and/or read, maybe watch some Netflix, then go to bed. When I heard this news I went out and bought a case of boxed wine (lasts me about three days) to just drink away the quarantine but have been drinking ever since. I thought that maybe tripping on some acid would help with some self reflection and perspective but while that helped some it only made me feel more depressed. Still drinking tonight, and can't really see a way out. Seriously, the gym was my new addiction. Without an outlet, I'm struggling to stay sober. How are others staying sober with this whole lock down?"
313,1,"Evening all. Well it's 01:14 here in the UK and I'm still wide awake. 

We, like most of the world are now in full lockdown and cracks are appearing in the infrastructure. 

I have a large.house that needs tidying but no motivation. Working from home is just a blur. I actually forgot it was Monday today and missed a massive meeting and had to explain that one. 

I don't think I want to drink but I know that if I did it would make this so much more reasonable. I also know that if I do drink there is a 99% chance I land myself in hospital with partial liver failure. Can you imagine that with everything else that's going on? I'd have to go to.the emergency room and I think I would feel worse for putting more pressure on an already crippled NHS. Selfish I think is how I would describe myself if that happened. 


So, 265 days I think. To throw it all away now would be insane. So I won't. 

I hope everyone is holding up and staying safe."
314,1,"Hi everyone,

Hope you are safe and well. Last week I jumped back on the wagon after several false starts. So I am a few days shy of two weeks sober at the moment. Today I got hit HARD by cravings. My partner is drinking beer daily, and we are both stuck at home, and I just wanted to have a drink dangit! I almost grabbed the bottle out of his hand yesterday to take a sip, and all this afternoon I just kept thinking ""maybe I should just drink. Who gives a shit? We are stuck at home anyway, and my partner seems to handle drinking just fine. I probably can too."" 

And you know what? If I asked him, or most people in my life, they would probably agree. Just drink a little, it won't kill you. You don't drink THAT much, you're fine, it's all in your head. You are just being dramatic. 

I have given into those (real and perceived) responses time and time again. I have internalized them... but not today! I acknowledged that my cravings were really bad. I didn't talk about it. I didn't focus on it. I did other things, puttered around, exercised, cooked and ate a nice dinner. 

And now I don't feel like drinking at all. It's funny how that works!

Thank you for being here and supportive. I read posts here every day, and it often helps me. It helped me get here today, and even if it's the dozenth time, or the hundredth time I re-resolve to stop drinking, it doesn't matter because I think every sober day counts, and every decision to choose to be present is a victory.

Have a good night and thank you so much,"

Four freaking digits of sobriety and I feel great. Sure my life is still shitty in many ways because of how I ruined it with my drinking but I can only imagine how worse off I would be if I didn‚Äôt quit. With this quarantine I‚Äôve been thinking about alcohol ALOT but still am avoiding it.


It‚Äôs still hard for me to be proud of myself for anything because I still hate myself for everything I‚Äôve done in the past and it‚Äôs hard for me to move on but to be completely honest I never thought I‚Äôd make it this far. My alcohol consumption got so bad that I was actively trying to kill myself with it pretty much. But damn when I saw that 1000 days I did feel a little proud.

318,1,"howdy y'all hope everyone is staying safe and sober during this uncertain time. Yesterday marked my 6 month without a single drop of alcohol. on september 29th I got pulled over for speeding after tailgating a football game all day. I had been blackout all day and decided around 2 am I was safe to drive my girlfriend and I back to my spot. I got pulled over for speeding about 2 minutes from my home. I knew without a doubt the minute I saw those stupid lights that I was fucked. I was 20 at the time. that night I thought my life was over... little did I know it was just going to begin. That night I sat in jail even though I was sober (I blew below .08 at the time of arrest) thinking over all the other nights I had driven either myself or friends or loved ones. It wasn't irregular for me to drive blackout to get a pack of cigs.... and that's what made me realize that I had to put down the bottle for good. I started drinking when I was 12 and started drugging when I was 14. Today I can look back and literally see and feel the change. I can look back at one of the lowest points in my life, a time when I nearly committed suicide to escape my reality for good, and say that quitting alcohol and drugs saved me. Yesterday I thought long and hard about my substance abuse and really came to terms that my sobriety is now MY choice. and it will continue to be my choice as I am growing in ways I never knew I would. This sub has also been extremely helpful as I have not found the time to go to a meeting yet. I enjoy reading others posts and it makes me so happy when I read of other successes battling this disease. Even when my depression is truly defeating and the monster in the back of my head screams for me to drink or drug I refuse because each day I can fight I win. This life is beautiful and I am so happy to be here. IWNDWYT"

We are connected thicker than blood. 

We understand, we know, without question or answer who and what connects us all to be here, with each-other tonight. 

So tell me, what is the part of you that you like the most? 

Anything, from your nose to personality traits. Tell the family like a game of bloody who‚Äôs who. 

What makes us ok with being us? 

What are you happiest with right now? 

Love you x"
320,1,"So I just discovered this subreddit and I am glad I did because of this whole virus fiasco! Anyway, I have been an alcoholic since I was 20 (currently 29) and I participated in dry January this year and made it all the way through. Although, unfortunately, relapsed on February 1st.. Spiraled back into binge drinking and all that fun stuff.. Anyway, on day 4 and I would at least like to get to April 15th as a goal for myself.. I am an episodic binge drinker and constantly think i can have 3 beers and stop but it always turns into a black out.. Then I wake up and just start again without even being mentally present.. I have absolutely no idea how to beat this especially now with this pandemic and being out of work.. I think I might be addicted to sugar?

Thank you for coming to my TED talk (lol that joke is played out but I still love it)"
321,1,"I am so proud of everyone who is sober or trying to get sober. This shit is hard. Every day I have been waking up and putting my best foot forward. Trying to focus on being productive and growing into the person I have always wanted to be. Honestly I‚Äôm just tired of trying, all I want to do it have one night of drinking... I am going to be alone all week and I have no real responsibilities right now because of the coronavirus. I am so fucking tempted to fall back into drinking. I just want to feel happy. For years drinking was the only thing I really looked forward to and the only thing that brought me some kind of happiness (I am trying to remind myself of all the terrible things it brought). I know my brain is working on repairing itself right now but when will I start to feel joy from regular life things?

323,1,"I have completed my first week of not drinking today. I am 23 years old and not addicted (yet) but was becoming slightly dependent, mentally mainly  but i have shakey hands sometimes. This scared me so i decided to moderate my drinking while i still can. My aim is to only drink and with moderation when i'm in good company like my friends or girlfriend since drinking alone just makes me sad, bored and unmotivated these days.

Tomorrow is my birthday and i have bought some nice beers and a good bottle of rum to enjoy with the woman of my dreams. The money i saved on cheap piss beer and budget vodka can now go to nice drinks of a good brand in moderate amounts. Normally i would've caved but i am able to now choose to do the right thing and NOT touch the alcohol, even though i know it's in the fridge. 

I know i'm not a 'real' alcoholic and i don't know how that is looked upon here but i am happy and proud that i can sit here sober. I am enjoying video games, cooking and my car again. Something i couldn't do anymore while under the influence. Everything except loud music would just be boring to me.

Good luck everyone, stay healthy and safe!"
324,1,"I'll be honest, I've been both looking forward to this and dreading it for some time. Inside my head has been an echo chamber for weeks, with a whisper turning into a crescendo of booming words, six months without a drink, without Drinking, Drink, DRINKING, DRINK...

This lockdown hasn't helped. I've been stuck inside, only going out when I need to, for everything my entire family needs, once a day. Gaming isn't fun like it used to be, it's the same thing again and again, reading doesn't hold the joy it used to, and my only outlet is cleaning and weight training. 

But, I might not be very happy, but at least I'm sober with it. I can rationalise, understand my fruatration, do things I wouldn't normally. So tomorrow, I'm gonna hoover the one area of my house that's often neglected: the stairs. I'm gonna have a good workout, trial some new exercises and then maybe paint the bathroom. Have a sense of achievement. 

And then maybe, just maybe the echo chamber inside my head will grow quiet and still. I will be able to breathe again and enjoy what little of life we can right now. 

It will be good. 

Iwndwyt."
325,1,"I‚Äôve been sober about 2.5 years and other than the first few months, things have been pretty great. A core component of my sobriety has been consistent routines. Showing up when and where I‚Äôve committed. 

I‚Äôm about two weeks into abiding by the stat-home order. No going out except for groceries and working from home and I can already see the effects/emotional backsliding that the loss of routine has induced. Basically just restless, irritable, discontent and the drinking dreams that always seem to accompany this emotional state.

The great news is that I don‚Äôt want to and don‚Äôt plan to drink just for today. I‚Äôve also got a solid network of support friends that I‚Äôve tried to stay in contact with. Anyone else going through the same?"
326,1,"I knew all along that if I told myself I'd never drink again, I'd be doomed from the start - so I said I was going a year.  Once I was far enough in, that year was getting closer and it gave me something to hold onto.

Fast forward to the current global situation - it's really been stressing me out - I've really wanted a drink.  But I still held out until my year was up a week or so ago.

Now, my wife is out of town - I convinced myself that I could have just one night off - nobody would ever know.  I could carry on with my sober life after my night off and just lie to people or creatively answer.  After all, I quit smoking when I was 22, but I still had my share of smokes since then - but that's what I hold onto because that's when I quit being a daily smoker.

My urges got the best of me - so while I was out, I grabbed a 6-pack of some good strong beer.  Driving home though, it ran through my head - if I let today go, what's to stop me from letting tomorrow go?  And the next day?  Could I really tell people I haven't touched a drop in over a year, or would the lying be too much for me?  And given how bad I HAD to have that beer, apparently going a year without it just wasn't enough, because these cravings are completely out of control.

So, I came home, left the beer in the car and drank a 0.0% Heineken.  The beer is still there.  Honestly, I think I'm going to hide it somewhere that only I know about because it gives me a little more control (I have a lot of alcohol in the house, but I suspect my wife would know if I touched any of it).

I feel like that was a close one... I need to stick this out longer."
327,1,"As the title says, what are some things you guys do to help you get to sleep at night? I've always fell asleep due to alcohol and my biggest problem after quitting has been getting to sleep at night."
328,1,"Hi all.  First, just want to say that all your stories and tales are very inspiring.  I am a night time drinker.  Would wait till 8 pm, or later when I picked the kids up from activities and then get hammered watching TV and playing video games. I decided that I had enough.  Tired of the stomach issues, the hangovers, the ability to not work out in the morning.  The stay at home order has actually been ridiculously helpful as well.  The amount of pressure to drink in the first two weeks was crazy.  Now, its a game to see how long I can go. This 24 day stretch is the longest without substances in close to 25 years.  Kinda crazy.  anyway, keep the faith and stay strong.  Thanks for all your words."
329,1,"Any advice for me, from the people who have been? Any who wish my luck."
330,1,"That's it. I might. I might not. 
I've been good since the beginning of the year, but this COVID thing is really getting to me. I feel like I'm living in a failed Soviet satellite state. Everything is falling apart.
Maybe there are valid reasons to turn to drugs and drink to cope. Watching the world burn down seems like one of them.
I dunno. I know you aren't therapy, but when Talkspace is available for ""as little as"" $65 per week, venting here seemed like the more frugal option.
You do you. I hope you're well."
331,1,"Hi, I'm new here. Turned 33 last week, hardcore binge drinker of about six years. I can go days, or even weeks, at a time without alcohol. But then suddenly give in to impulsivity, self-medicating my anxiety and depression. And when I go, I go hard. I have a serious alcohol problem, but I don't understand why I don't have the daily cravings. It moresoe sneaks up on me randomly, so I need to identify those triggers. I think that's what worries me most about this: not knowing what kind of problem I am dealing with exactly and knowing how to react in those moments I suddenly want to drink.

 I lost my little sister a year ago due to an accidental overdose on her prescription pain pills after a chronic spinal injury, and she was my best friend. This is something I need to do for her as well as myself. I've also gained a lot of weight and have noted various effects on my health and psyche. It's destroying my relationships, ambitions, and quality of life. I'm tired of drinking myself into oblivion and losing the entire next day in my bed (like yesterday).

I am extremely introverted, and this online community seems like a good outlet for support. I've always brushed my drinking off in the past or found various ways to downplay or dismiss it. But it's time. There's no going back now. I want to reclaim my health and try to compensate for all the time lost. 

I'm just throwing this all out there, apologies for any missteps. 

With the exception of helping me tolerate plane flights, alcohol has simply never done me any good. It has only given me problems and more problems. I figure only positives can come from my decision, and it's not too late for my long term health and relationships. 

With love. &lt;3"
332,1,"I‚Äòm just grateful. Grateful to you all, grateful to AA, grateful for all the tools I‚Äôve picked up, all the people I‚Äôve met, stories I‚Äôve read and heard and shared. These are difficult times and i couldn‚Äôt be more grateful to be sober during them. 

I‚Äôm grateful for zoom! Talk about silver lining in this situation. There‚Äôs meetings everywhere all around the clock! I can attend more freethinkers meetings, LGBT meetings and even one with the intersectionality of the two! all around the world, every hour of the day! Fucking brilliant. 

Isolation? Only physical. I‚Äôm more integrated within my community than I‚Äôve ever been, chatting with friends, family, coworkers, lgbt folks, atheists, alcoholics, addicts, neighbors, locally, remotely and internationally. 

And I‚Äôm hopeful. I‚Äôm hopeful that this gives humanity a chance to reflect, individually and as a whole about how we go about business as usual. Cuz were being given this chance to understand the consequences of our actions, so let‚Äôs live up to the occasion.

Of course I hope that we‚Äôre able to minimize the amount of damage this is going to do, and lots of people are going to struggle, but it is all the more reason why we need to not let this all be for nothing. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm yammering on. 4 months done. Month 5, here I come!"
333,1,"Hey!
There happened a big bang (drunk bike accident, barely survived) which leads me to finaly making the decision to quit drinking. 
Luckily not addicted.

But going to university, where drinking alcohol is part of everyone's daily life's makes it pretty hard to step out of this ""normal"" system. I fear to miss out a lot. 
Most of my friends will understand me and hopefully not much will change but it could and probably will change.

Any tips, experience or idea how to overcome this ""problem"" to finaly leave this drug behind? 
The social aspect is the only issue with a big impact for me..."
334,1,"I'm so excited to begin start to rack up these little numbers again (from quarantine even) and keep on walking down a path where I don't booze. I don't need it, I found I don't enjoy it particularly, the feeling's not that great. I've of course found that the non-thinking lizard part of my brain has accidentally been tuned to take control when it comes to the booze -

It be like ""HELL *YES THIS IS THE WAY* I'VE GOT THIS, *DON'T WORRY ABOUT USING THE THINKING PART OF THE BRAIN* \- I HAVE THIS LET'S FUCKKKING GOOOOO"".

Because that part of the brain, the one that helps us exist in the world by low-level rewards and reinforcement  -the one that is really good at rewarding us when food is healthy for us on a basic nutrition level and getting us back to that tree or whatever - as it happens, is not the one that should be in control when it comes to booze - a poison mixed with fruit that is reinforced socially and is woven into our daily lives in a complex and insidious way.

Anyway, much love to you all. I will not drink with any of you bastards today."
335,1,"Does anyone else feeling generally negative, week &amp; needy after a day or few days of drinking?

In the days after a heavy drinking period, I am.  I look back on my mood, behaviour and general outlook in those days after and realise how different it makes me.  It really puts my into a pessimistic place and I really do feel like someone else completely."
336,1,"Sober for the first time  in two weeks. Heading into withdrawl. Lost my job, probably my relationship. Maybe my life. So fucking scared"
337,1,"Checking in to stay accountable and wanted to say if lonley and bored reply to this I'll reply back, it helps me with my soul sucking loneliness which is my biggest trigger. I would love to be able to return the favor!"
338,1,"I live in a country where alcohol sales and consumption are banned nationwide because people couldn't stop partying and weren't staying home. At first I was really mad about it (and honestly it makes me concerned for serious addicts health to be abruptly cut off without the chance to taper) but I'm ready. I've started going down the slope pretty bad over the last few months and drinking a ton, ignoring work and my studies (I'm trying to self-teach software engineering) and I've gained a lot of weight. 

So last night I polished off most of my stash, this morning I dumped the last bit of wine and today is day 1. I am assuming the alcohol ban and lockdown will last at least 2 months and I haven't gone that long without drinking in probably close to 20 years. So this will be an interesting experiment I guess. 

What are you guys doing to fill the time?"
339,1,"I caved.

Im (not frontline, but i guess secondline) essential worker with the mentally ill, and the state just seems determined to make my job more unsafe. There's nothing I can do, ive spoken up. if i rattle any more cages i risk losing my job.

I live with my 71 yr old mother. she's essential too working in a nursing home. Im terrified something will happen to her.

Im proud of my 128 days... I got passed my bullshit and normal stressors... but i cant handle this and im not ready to go back to sober me. just as with all things it was my decision to not drink, its my decision to drink now, and it will be my decision to not drink again probably in say a week or so.

I just cant handle this constant anxiety and feeling under attack 8hrs everyday in a filthy work environment working with people that bless their hearts, theyre not bad people but they dont have good hygiene or good risk/reward assessment and all I can do is wash my hands and try to encourage them to stay home."
340,1,I had to stop at the grocery store today to get some essentials. I have been pretty well stocked and have made few store runs to do my part to limit the spread of this virus. So temptation of course hits me as I passed the wine aisle. I managed to fight it off and continued shopping only to find myself circled around back to the wine aisle. I picked up a bottle of Merlot. Convincing myself that I could have the standard 1 glass of wine for heart health. I looked and inspected the bottle for 10 minutes. I put it in my cart. I started to walk away and put it back. Then picked it up again. Then put it back. And left the store without it. On the way home I passed my street and continued down to the gas station where they sell wine. Drove past and didn‚Äôt stop and am now safe and sound at home with no alcohol! This is so damn stupid though. I know damn well I can‚Äôt moderate. But I rode the wave and fought the urge. Thankfully I thought of this group and all the stories to remind me many of us don‚Äôt moderate too well and can‚Äôt try to fool ourselves into making a mistake!!
341,1,"So, I stopped drinking 6 months ago as I wanted to devote more time to my wife and kids. I work 6 days a week as a postman/mailman and I would almost always be hungover on Sunday mornings. Needless to say, my life has changed significantly (for the better) and I don't intend to drink again.  I would drink maybe 1 or 2 beers most weeknights, and would have between 5 and 10 on a Saturday. Sometimes a few on a Sunday. This became the norm over a 5 year period. Many of my friends still drink a similar amount to what I used to. I found it incredibly easy to stop drinking (I'm extremely stubborn). My question is, was I an alcoholic? I didn't need to drink, I did it through choice and habit. I don't miss drinking at all. I feel it's a grey area, where people don't consider themselves alcoholics, but are drinking (even a relatively small amount) on a day to day basis. I think many people live like this (especially where I'm from in England) and don't consider themselves alcoholics."
342,1,"This past year has been the absolute worse for me - 
And I selfishly used it as an excuse to drink heavily.  I've had many many attempts at getting sober but this is the longest I've gone without alcohol. I know its not much but it's getting easier with each day. Lots of hot coco, hot tea, trying new recipes and working out at home.  When I was drinking I never took responsibility for what I did wrong, but now I'm ready to face the facts, accept responsibility, and move forward to better myself. 
IWNDWYT"
343,1,"I need to be honest here and explain my experience in order to ask my question. I stopped drinking six months ago, prior to that I'd been drinking about a bottle of 4% beer each night. I occasionally got drunk with friends around once a month. 

Suddenly I started having intense auditory hallucinations; voices would tell me I was going to die or hurt someone and I remember hearing a crying baby in the middle of a field whilst a fanfare of trumpets played from nowhere. 

I also became extremely delusional and actually believed I was a God who could change the world. During this time I was very depressed and had many thoughts of hurting myself. Once I stopped drinking this alleviated within days; I was not addicted and experiencing hallucinations from withdrawal.

Does anyone have an idea what this may be caused by?"

Drinking career:


I used to drink and smoke weed and do coke and mdma and DMT and everything I could get hold of when I was 15-20 just going out with friends and stuff.

When I was young I'd just throw up when I drank too much .Started getting black outs on nights out , starting drinking at home due to boredom , had periods of time smoking insane amounts of weed too , at that time id rarely drink.

It then ramped up to early twenties I was spending hundreds of quid a night drinking 4 pints / a bottle of wine / 35cl vodka before going out , often drinking another 350ml bottle of vodka during the night.

I got put in the police cell multiple times , car accident , fights , assault charge etc.

I had tried for years to give up but I couldn't do it . I'd drink average 40 units a week and rare bender. 

How I stopped ;

I started smoking tons of weed. That helped with boredom. I went on tinder to keep my self busy originally but ended up getting a girlfriend so that also kept me busy. During my time spent smoking weed I played video games again and got really into it and now when I'm not high ( definitely addicted to weed but i can stop I just hate stopping , but I do take long breaks ) or drunk I play video games. 

I got really into lifting weights and was always lifting when I was drinking but since not drinking got insane shape which helped on tinder but being able to see how good I can look has made me obsess about health and fitness.

I also notice since I rarely drink if I do drink even a pint I romanticise it and think it will be so nice and I drink the pint and don't feel any better just dumber and then I instantly regret it and hour later I feel like shit and don't sleep well that night and look noticeable tired after it. Bit of dry mouth.

Since then when I drink I actually get anxiety knowing how gross it will make me feel so I actually still occasianally drink beers that aren't too strong like 4% beer max.

Now I can drink very occasianally and yea I don't even crave it any.more"
348,1,Just wondering if anyone felt their body reacted differently to caffeine after they stopped drinking? When I drink coffee now I feel very agitated. Which sucks coz I love coffee.
349,1,Just commenting on another post and realised I'm 256 days today. Only 100 to go to my first year. How time flys when your having fun and sober! IWNDWYT!
350,1,"On Friday afternoon I woke up to loud knocking on my door. After rushing to get some clothes on, I opened the door to several policemen and EMTs doing a wellfare check. Confused, they tell me my friend, Emily (obviously not using real names), had come to check on me and  spent an hour knocking on my door before calling them. They, too, had been there a while banging on the door and were about to break in through a window.  This left me asking, ""How has it come to this?""

Since I started self-isolating two weeks ago (minus those trips to the store to buy more beer), my mental health, which hasn't been good for a long time, had been rapidly declining. As soon as I had put my work laptop away each day, I would quickly down several IPAs, then start drunk dialing friends and family and drinking the night away til I passed out.

Thursday night was when I finally had a complete breakdown. I don't remember much of that night, but I do remember deciding that I couldn't handle the loneliness anymore and that during the weekend I would be moving across the country to stay with partner, Ron. I know I called and/or texted Ron, my parents, friends, and even my boss to tell them. However, I don't remember any of the conversations I had. The only things I do remember are a neighbor coming outside to check that I was okay and drinking way more than I normally do.

My rash decision had people worried and Emily told me that Ron had been trying to get ahold of me all morning to check on me. When he wasn't able to, he called Emily and another close friend that lives a few hours away (Tanya) to say he was really worried and didn't know what to do.

Once police and EMS left, Emily and I went back into my apartment and the four of us had a conference call about how to proceed. They were all worried about me, as well as tired of dealing with my drunken antics over the past few years. They didn't trust me to remain alone and wanted me to finally get help for my depression and anxiety, and the amount of alcohol I had been using to self-medicate. It was decided that I would go stay with Tanya for a while since she would be able to keep an eye on me until we could make more long-term plans for my recovery.

I am a few days into sobriety now. I am so grateful for the support system I have and have good feelings that this will be the time I stop drinking that finally sticks and that I'll get the treatment I need for my mental health problems. They have been working to find ways of me getting help, which has been abnormally hard with the pandemic, and reaching out to other people, such as my boss and parents, to make them aware of the situation (well, as aware as they need to be). Tonight we are having another conference call between the four of us to discuss further plans and options. Although I have been dealing with daily panic attacks from the anxiety, I feel happiness knowing I have people who care so much about me. 

Although I have a lot more I want to say, this introduction post is getting long enough. I'm happy to be here r/stopdrinking and I am finally ready to quit and make it stick this time."
352,1,"Long story short, my boyfriend and I are both alcoholics. We were sober for three months and then relapsed a month ago for almost the entirety of March. Our relationship went to shit because of it and we broke up for a week. We got back together last Monday and have both stayed sober since, which has been amazing for us individually and in our relationship. I love him so much and we are each other's biggest support system in a healthy way.

Anyway, we're both quarantined together in my apartment while he's working from home on the computer and he's having a relaxed work day because there's not much for him to do. He ""jokingly"" said ""let's get drunk"" and I told him that was extremely triggering for me because now I can't get the thought out of my head. Alcohol is the reason we almost lost our relationship and had the worst fight of out lives. He *just* finished detoxing to the point of almost going to the hospital. We both know it would be a TERRIBLE idea, but I feel like if I said ""fuck it, let's do it"" he would agree. And that we're both going to enable each other and spiral back into the shithole we just crawled out of barely alive. Wow.

It doesn't even make sense as to why I'd think this time will be different if we just drank this *one day* (yeah, right!), but I'm having a hard time turning my brain off. He's working a few feet away from me, but right now it's the elephant in the room and I don't know how to talk about it without feeling awkward. Thanks for listening, guys. You're all amazing."
353,1,"I haven't checked in for awhile, but I was curious to see how many days I've been sober.  888 to my surprise!  To all of you struggling, believe me, it gets easier it really does.  I still lurk from time to time and your stories all inspire me.  I'm so thankful that this place on the internet exists.  Quitting drinking was literally the hardest thing I've ever done in my life...and also the most worthwhile thing."
354,1,"So I think I'm now in a place where I don't really think about drinking daily anymore.  It took a really long time to get here but it doesn't consume my thoughts.  The narrative has changed.  The conversation in my brain used to be how am I going to be happy without drinking to now, why am I  unhappy today?  To me that feels like a big shift in my thought process.  I'm now addressing the reasons that I turned to alcohol in the first place.  When I ask myself those questions now, it's not laced with ""well you probably feel that way because you were medicating yourself for years"".  Now it's become me just dealing with myself and my feelings.  I starting to know the person I was suppose to be and what my mental capacity really is without alcohol stunting it's growth.

Take COVID-19 and the world being held captive.  When this went down, I lost several of my outlets that I was using to distract my brain from the grind of life.  I could go into the details of classes I was taking but those are just that, irrelevant details.  The issue was, life changed and I needed to change with it.  But the thing was, when this happened a few weeks ago, I found out I was actually ready.  The drunk version of me would've been pissed about everything and would've used this as an excuse or message that the universe wanted me to drink.  But now, I see it differently.  You can't control the world around you, you can only control how you perceive it.  How you feel about it, how you feel about yourself.  So I adjusted.  I started working out at home, starting playing the guitar more, got back to playing video games, actually started watching shows again and finding enjoyment from them. 

I think what I'm trying to say is, life is going to change whether you want it to or not.  We can't control our environments, or our own bodies for that matter but we do have control over our minds.  It's our strongest advocate to overcome adversity in this ever-changing playing field.  I think now my mind is only just starting to grow again.   Thanks for listening and IWNDWYT."
355,1,"Day 5. Been stuck in the same damn flat for 14 days, save for the 40 mins i went shopping. 

I want to go for a walk in the woods or the beach, however the Police have set up road blocks to nosey at where you are going. Sending you home or giving you a fine if they decide your journey is unnecessary. 

Seriously bored and stewing in my environment. 

Also for no reason hating everybody today."
356,1,"What's Going Well:
- Clear head. In control of myself. Able to see through cravings, understanding my moments of weakness. No hangovers, less inflammation, less bloating. No more BO like the first 3 weeks. The big line in my forehead is much lighter, without using Botox. More productivity, able to appreciate simple things and quiet time. Better equipped to deal with this current situation in the world. My husband is SF going this with me and he's great support. 


What isn't going well:
- Hmm. Sleep hasn't caught up to itself fully, but when I'm consistent with exercise, drinking water, and deep breath exercises, I can sleep deeply. I eat too much and the current boredom of sheltering doesnt help. Need to be more consistent so I can reap more benefits.


My committment: IWNDWYT! This is the new me, who was also the old me before I drank. I will take care of this woman. 


Advice for others: Get through that first week. Then look back and reaffirm your commitment for another week. Just one tip to make it one week and then keep pushing. It gets better."
358,1,I just discovered r/stopdrinking 5 minutes ago. My mom passed away of alcoholism-related complications in April 2017 and I‚Äôve been drinking ever since. It‚Äôs almost like her alcoholism passed on to me after she died. I don‚Äôt know what to do to tackle this problem. I just know I don‚Äôt want it to put me in the ground like it did to her.

360,1,One day I won't be counting days anymore.  This whole ugly Covid business will pass and the sun will come out tomorrow.  IWNdWYT
361,1,I drank 6 IPAs last night and took several sips of a stronger alcohol as well. I did something similar every day last week.
362,1,"Everyday I‚Äôve been having the urge to drink, but I remind myself of all of the reasons it‚Äôs been ruining my life. Some days are tougher than others, but I‚Äôve been powering through it. Everyday, I‚Äôve been waking up with a clear head and gratitude for not drinking the day before. I prefer this cycle much more than the vicious cycle I have been in with alcohol every day and night."
363,1,"I reached the 100 day mark today! It‚Äôs been an interesting journey. I‚Äôve only made it to 85 days before and this is the longest I‚Äôve gone without a drink since my early twenties. It feels great honestly.  A bit challenging sometimes as it is for everyone right now for many reasons, but there are so many more reasons to stay sober. I work for a large urban EMS department and see the effects of alcoholism and addiction on many of my patients. It really does reinforce my resolve every time.  I know there is a long road ahead and I look forward to navigating it with you all. So here‚Äôs to health!

IWNDWYT"
364,1,"I‚Äôm out of work because of the pandemic, as I‚Äôm sure many of us are, and it has been incredibly hard for me to stay sober. In fact, I haven‚Äôt been sober for the better part of the past two weeks. What‚Äôs really eating me up is that my alcoholism has made me selfish at a time when I should be extra careful and cautious of what I‚Äôm potentially bringing home to my family; I live with my grandparents and have still been going out to the stores to buy booze. Now that I‚Äôm sobering up and my head is clearing up, I‚Äôm wracked with guilt. I was just out at the stores yesterday to stock up again. So far none of us are sick, but having just been out in public yesterday I have to ride out the next couple of weeks waiting for symptoms of covid to appear (hopefully they won‚Äôt). It‚Äôs a scary time, but I‚Äôm determined to face it with a clear head from here on out. 

I hope you‚Äôre all staying safe and healthy. I will not drink with you today."
365,1,"I‚Äôve noticed that after the one year milestone, the lane markers get a little further apart. The Nomo app pushes up milestones from one month to every six months. We also don‚Äôt tend to keep track of individual months beyond a year in our world, so somehow counting 13, 14, etc. doesn‚Äôt have quite the same feeling. 

500 days feels like the next big one after a year. I‚Äôve been thinking about 500 in the back of my mind for awhile, seeing others post about it on here in the early days and thinking it would seem like it would take foreverrrrrr to get so far. And it is forever, since I quit, even if it‚Äôs really ‚Äúonly‚Äù a year and 4.5 months. Turns out, day at a time, it can happen.

I‚Äôm writing this while holding my two month old baby boy. It‚Äôs fun to have a second monthly lane marker to help keep track of time. The 16th is for sobriety, and the 23rd is to mark off months of my little man‚Äôs life. Both markers are important and feed off one another.  The sobriety lets me give every bit of my true self to the kiddo, and the kiddo gives me the strength and motivation to keep sober.

It‚Äôs great to be here with all of you. IWNDWYT"
366,1,"I'm here on day 1. I've had success moderating, but I can feel myself slipping more every day. I started counting and planning my day around a buzz. I've got to stop.

I'm so nervous about stopping again. I'm stuck at home and I'm going to be bored. Free time is quicker to pass when I'm buzzed. 

I'm anxious and my stomach is in knots. I know in a day or 2 I will be glad I stopped before I started blacking out again. I just hate taking that first step. 

Wish me luck friends."
368,1,"Whelp, back to day 5....but at least I'm on day 5!!  Made it I think to day 4 about a month ago. Maybe it was 5, I dunno, then decided I could have a few and it lasted a few weeks, none of which were bad hangovers at least (better than usual but still way too much!).  Now my SO is together in this with me and suggested we both quit for a bit üòÄ.  It's so much easier having a partner in sobriety especially during these hard times.  I'm so bored at home and all I want to do is drink, but we got more done this weekend than we have in over a month, and have kept up with the dishes and laundry AND floors all week!  Not to mention this was probably the first weekend we haven't drank in ages.  I have a ton of projects planned and can't wait to accomplish them, now I just have to get my brain to stop telling me I'm bored and should accompany my projects with alcohol.

Thanks to everyone for posting on this sub. I'm mostly lurking but reading everyones success and bump in the roads are very helpful for me to help me stay on track and realize that I'm not alone in this and there are ways out, despite the hiccups that may occur.  

IWNDWYT!"
369,1,I‚Äôm so excited! Haha! Feels so good
371,1,"I had some pretty wild and vivid dreams and nightmares last night, has anyone else experienced this early on?"
372,1,"I've known that my drinking was a problem for a while now... But since I've been cooped up alone I've totally gone off the deep end. I've been buying a litre bottle of rum every other day, I just can't stop myself.

  


I'm watching my body deteriorate rapidly and I'm scared. I got really drunk the other night and shaved all my hair off, and I think I was quite handsome before but when I look in the mirror now there's a bald headded puffy faced weirdo looking back at me. I'm scared that I've lost control. Also a little scared of what the next few days without it are going to be like.

  


But I got this! Any advice on getting through the next few days would be appreciated."
373,1,"I‚Äôm a 23 F and I‚Äôve been a daily drinker for around two years now only skipping days occasionally. I‚Äôll drink anywhere from a six pack of 16oz beers (I quit that after I gained a shit ton of weight), to a fifth of vodka. In my head, it was a great idea. I can drink on it for two nights, I‚Äôll lose weight, and spend less money in the long run. How wrong I was, a fifth lasted two nights for awhile until my tolerance built up and suddenly I was buying handles of it instead. 

I had a particularly bad bender that started a few days ago. I‚Äôd drink, sleep, wake up and then start all over again. During this time I ate very little and probably didn‚Äôt drink nearly as much water as I should. On the third morning I woke up with the worst hangover I‚Äôve ever had. This thing was like a culmination of three bad hangovers that has mighty morphed into some terrible monstrosity. I was shaking, my heart palpitating, and I was dry heaving, but there was nothing on my stomach so it was only vile and streaks of blood. 

Never had I felt this way being hungover before, but I already knew then I never wanted to again. Iv‚Äôe let this thing control my life for too long. It‚Äôs exacerbated my preexisting anxiety that I once used alcohol to medicate, and I‚Äôve developed agoraphobia. Alcohol has ruined my life and I can‚Äôt do this anymore. This isn‚Äôt the person I want to be for the rest of my life. 

Around the 22-25 hour mark was the hardest. I had another intense panic attack, like the all impending doom I feel like my hearts going to beat out of my chest variety. I thought I might need to go to the ER, and out of desperation I called my Dad. I fully expected disappointment or anger, but I was met with understanding, he‚Äôd been expecting something was up for awhile. Turns out you can‚Äôt hide things from recovered addicts. He‚Äôs since been helping me out, and I got the meds I needed for high BP and the intense anxiety. I‚Äôve also been able to actually eat, and I‚Äôm starting to think some of my symptoms were from low blood sugar. 

I wan‚Äôt so badly to kick this for good and get my life back on track. It‚Äôs daunting when I look at the things I want and need to do, and being left feeling held back by my mental health. I know that‚Äôs the thing I need to focus on first and foremost. Any tips or words of encouragement would be great! 


TLDR; I woke up from a bender having intense withdrawal symptoms that lasted into the night and the next day. I‚Äôve since gotten help and just started on day three. I‚Äôm now feeling a lot better, just a bit on the anxious side."
374,1,"Hello Gang, I‚Äôve been a lurker for a while on only started posting today. 

A little bit of my situation,I originally quit drinking to quit smoking. While I stopped drinking to curb nicotine cravings, I realized my relationship with alcohol through the years hasn‚Äôt been the healthiest. I‚Äôm the type that can‚Äôt have one. My ex and I would normally have wine every night during dinner and I would usually finish the bottle and maybe a bit more. Alcohol we bought to have at home wouldn‚Äôt last long. There would be days where I wouldn‚Äôt drink but the days that I would could get out of hand. 

Anyways, my original goal was to stop drinking for 3 months. Along the way, it changed to 100 days. With a little more then 10 days to reach my goal, I‚Äôm really at a crossroads. My mind and heart are giving me mixed singles. On one hand, I want to see if this break changed my relationship with alcohol. I kind of want to see if I can actually have one and only drink socially. I really don‚Äôt want to have a hangover ever again. 

But on the other hand, I have felt really good without alcohol and booze(and smokes!). I have more time,feel great and have started working out. It‚Äôs just crazy to think that I may not drink ever again. Which is a good thing! 

I‚Äôve been really excited to hit my goals and I‚Äôm really proud of myself. But also, there is a bit of doubt to what will happen next and what the next step should be. 

Any thoughts? 

And thank you to everyone on this thread. It has helped me so much."
375,1,Honestly not sure what to do or change. I'm finding this close to impossible. I can do a few days but then I cave. I've reset so many times.
376,1,Hit one year over the weekend. Proud of that and just going to keep going. It has been one of the best and most productive years of my life and I feel like I have gotten myself back on track. I don't think I would have been able to do that if I didn't get sober.
377,1,But it is what it is. I went on vacation and decided to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù and then I‚Äôve started to have it since I‚Äôve been home. Time to stop again and get honest with myself and all of you.
378,1,"I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a full blown alcoholic, but an abuser at times. I‚Äôm under a incredible amount of stress and strain right now. I have so much responsibility on my shoulders, and I don‚Äôt know how much of it I can handle. I can‚Äôt please everyone, and I feel like at this point with some of these responsibilities I‚Äôm about to shut down. Now is literally the worst time for that, and I see it happening but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm strong enough to stop it

Suicidal thoughts have been coming back at times, I‚Äôve been thinking of mutilating my body, cutting off small appendages and shit like that. I‚Äôve been taking meds and doing my best but I cannot stop the thoughts my brain produces. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. 

First drink two nights ago, stronger drink last night. My casual drinking is fine. But when I start to drink just to not feel like dying is when I see red flag. 

I‚Äôm gonna be honest I‚Äôd like a really open minded person to talk to, I feel alone and weak at a time when I need to be the strongest I‚Äôve ever been"
379,1,"I am so angry with myself. Why can't I just ""get it?"" I've read This Naked Mind (more than one), Alcohol Explained (also more than once), listened to podcasts, read the Big Book of AA, been in and out of AA for years and I just can't seem to stay sober. I'm angry and frustrated and feeling hopeless. It doesn't help that I am super dehydrated and detoxing after several days of drinking lots of vodka and tonic. Sad part is trying to hide it from my husband because of how ashamed I feel about drinking, and he knows. Is there anyone here who tried for years to get and stay sober and finally was successful? 

Thanks for reading."
381,1,"Hello r/stopdrinking 

What a long strange trip it has been! I feel incredibly fortunate to say that as of 8:00 am on 3/30/2020, I have gone a full year without alcohol!

A little about me, I am a 26(M) and I used to drink hard. Like 10-12 shots a night sometimes more, and it was as always pedal to the metal when I drank. I didn‚Äôt really drink in HS, but senior year and into college it started to ramp up. My grades suffered in my freshman year, but I didn‚Äôt do anything at the time.

I spent years spinning my wheels, in a constant cycle of drinking, drunk, hungover, and add a couple of arguments and fights every few weeks and you had my life. My friends didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me, my family didn‚Äôt either and I was hanging on at work by a thread.

I ended up kicked out of my place and was couch surfing for a week around this time last year. I was drinking 24/7 and feeling really sorry for myself. If I didn‚Äôt wake up one day, at the time I would have been okay with that. But one day I woke up while at my buddies house and had a revelation: **this shit sucks**

I waited until my friend woke up, and I asked her to drive me to the nearest detox facility and not to turn around even if I begged her to. I was locked in, and even when we pulled in the parking lot I had the feeling of ‚Äúholy shit I‚Äôm doing this.‚Äù I checked in and spoke with a doctor who told me if I tried to detox on my own cold turkey, there‚Äôs a possibility I could die.

They took my drawstrings and shoelaces, I had an old Harry Potter book (Prisoner of Azkaban IIRC) and I was in their care for about a week. 

When I got out, I went to AA meeting but it never really clicked for me, if it works for you I wish nothing but the best but for me this subreddit has been a godsend. I try and reach out to people I went to rehab with to help each other stay on the straight and narrow.

But I am so so so fortunate to be sober right now during all of this craziness. I‚Äôm trying to count my blessings, and fortunately I still have a job as a work in a ‚Äúessential industry‚Äù, but more importantly I have my family back, my friends, and I am saving so much money not buying booze. I‚Äôve lost weight, my blood pressure is lower and I feel that I am in a much better place physically than I was next year. 

My creativity is better and I have been reading a lot more and composing more music! I have to say that not being hungover rules, and it‚Äôs such a gift to be sober in these crazy times. Whether your young, old, tried to get sober once or this is your first time, stay on target! Don‚Äôt let the news get to you, I have found shutting that off and unsubscribing from the subreddits have been great for my mental health.

Stay safe, stay sober everyone!
IWNDWYT"
382,1,I told myself that I wasnt going to drink this weekend but that didnt happen. I really dont want to feel like crap but it's so hard to not drink. Here is hoping I can get through the day...
383,1,"Although it‚Äôs a small amount of time I am proud of myself and wanted to share to motivate others. 1 week sober and I have never felt better. My head feels light, my body feels energized, and my emotions are relaxed. I can do this!!! :)"
384,1,"I'm just so damn happy nowadays.  It's gotten to where I kind of have to hide it, because I'm just bursting at the seams.  I know I'm lucky and others are struggling and have some really tough shit laid out in front of them.  My sibling are both dealing with some major medical concerns, so I'm trying not to be abrasive in my good fortune...  But it is intensely gratifying to be reaping the benefits of my good choices and hard work. 

1000 days ago, I was a mess.  Not on the outside (unless you count the additional weight I was carrying and the frequent hangovers), but on the inside.  I was frustrated, angry, sad, lazy, incredibly guarded, and defensive.  I constantly felt on the verge of a panic attack and used alcohol liberally to try and ""solve"" or at least deaden all my problems.  A few drinks and who cares about that stuff anyway, right?

Well, I do.  I care a lot now!  But what started me off was not trying to care about EVERYTHING at once.  There was a post on here a day or two ago where people were discussing ""one day at a time.""  I realize that it doesn't resonate with everyone (which is fine!  find what works for you!), but for me it allowed me to reset the clock and start making good choices.  In addition to not worrying too much about the choices I'll have to make tomorrow, it allowed me to move past my prior actions as well.  Yes, older decisions and actions have repercussions, but the only way to build a new story and prove what I can do is to go forward and make it better, one day at a time.  For the first 500 days or so, my one and only focus was not drinking.  Candy, cookies, pizza, root beer... whatever.  And let me tell you what, a snickers bar or two absolutely saved me from some of the stronger cravings.  I let myself have anything as long as it wasn't booze.  After that first year and a half, it didn't seem so hard anymore, so I added better diet choices and cut out most of the sugars I was eating.  About 850 days in, this year, I added exercise.  I now ""run"" (perhaps, slow jog would be a more appropriate term) a few miles a week.

1000 days ago, I don't believe it would have been sustainable for me to stop drinking, start eating right, and exercising all at once.  Physically possible, maybe, but I was not mentally prepared.  By taking an incremental approach, one day at a time... it's working.  I now apply that mantra to most things I commit to for self-improvement.  I can't promise that I will ALWAYS and FOREVER be trying this hard.  I can't promise that I won't screw up.  But I absolutely can say that I won't drink today, I ran this morning, and I'm happy to be here.

Now, instead of all the negative emotions swirling constantly in my head, I feel a deep sense of gratitude.  I'm thankful that my husband and son are still around for me to be better for.  Thankful to all my friends and family who were patient and genuine, even when I was a mess.  Grateful for a community like this one that constantly encourages those endeavoring for self-improvement  whether it's on day 1 or day 10,000.  

Thank you r/stopdrinking, thank you family, thank you friends, thank you WORLD for allowing me to reap these benefits.  Have a good day, everyone, and be proud of yourselves.  IWNDWYT!"
385,1,"I've been having 2-4 drinks daily for the last week.

I really notice the effect that has on my head.  I feel weak mentally.  I feel tired.  Kind of like I don't have the focus/energy/assertiveness to do the things I want to/need to.

Does anyone notice this with a couple of drinks every day?"
386,1,"It‚Äôs been about two weeks since my last drink. I‚Äôm laid off from work, currently don‚Äôt have a girlfriend to worry about, and have literally nothing to do and nowhere to be for the foreseeable future. All I can think about is drinking a whole bottle of wine, then probably another one on top of it.
Normally, I can come up with a good reason to hold back but right now I‚Äôm having trouble."
387,1,"Well, I was doing good. Had a little over 30 days under my belt. Started drinking again a little over a week ago. The first couple of times were okay. I was able to moderate somewhat. Then the obsession started to kick in. I was worrying if I had enough beer. Constantly thinking about when I would start drinking that day. The anxiety came back full force.  And the restless nights. Friday night was the turning point. I ended up getting wasted by myself. I hate how I felt and the hangover it caused. I started over on Saturday. I feel like I can do it this time."
389,1,"Sitting in a room alone. The tears stream down my face. I watch the people connect and interact on the TV. I yearn for connection but I am isolated. Closed off from a world I desperately want to be part of. I raise the bottle to my lips. It is my only friend. The warmth of the whiskey warms my heart as it passes to my stomach and I confuse this sensation for love. It is the closest I will get I think as I continue to watch my human desires being dissected and exposed on TV. Life seems so easy for them as my tears turn to cries of envy and hatred pointed outwards but many fall back like the corona of the sun. The mass of my self-pity is too huge to turn it all outwards. Alone and isolated. Festering in my own emotions and confusion. 

For years, incidents like the one I described were all too often.

The isolation I have to go through now is for the greater good. To get better. When I was isolated before I only got worse. Thank fuck I don‚Äôt have to live like that anymore.

Here's to staying sober and staying indoors.

It'll be worth it in the end.

Charlie."

393,1,"It's been a few years now since I've stopped drinking. A lot in my life has changed for the better. Sleepless, anxiety and weight gain have vastly diminished. I am performing better professionally and physically than I have in the last decade. And I owe it to the choice to stop.  I tried a number of times and failed. I wasn't fully committed.  But I saw the writing on the wall, the way that lifestyle ends. It's not pretty. My friend OD'd in October.  Sure, different drug of choice, but similar end results.

I know  this time must be very difficult for you. It is difficult even for the 'normal' folks. Maybe you can't make it to your meeting. Maybe you are less accountable now that you lost your job or dont need to show up in person. Maybe you're making justifications.

Now is not the time to drink: Due to drinking, and the poor diet and lack of sleep that accompanies it I was sick far more frequently. Constant colds, chest infections, etc. Now I get a solid 8 or 9 hours of sleep and eat healthy homemade food and exercise. I have the mental clarity to be careful about washing my hands, or put on a mask properly if I go to a market.  Check in with my parents.  Drinking makes you sloppy and unhealthy, and in times like this you cannot afford it.

You have the power to become sober within you. You can come here for support, come to IRC for support, but ultimately it depends on YOU. You can do it. I'll recommend once again ""Powerless No Longer"" by Pete Soderman. But you don't even need that: you know what you need to do.

397,1,"I've just woke up after a rough nights sleep and having my morning coffee and immediately worrying about getting my 1st drink. However I think maybe today might be the day I say no. Not today. 

Im an alcoholic (30F) and have been drinking for over a year since my last dry period. My tolerance is going up and I usually drink cider but now hitting the harder stuff. I have Bipolar and BPD and am I'm in a hypermanic state at the moment (have been for a few weeks now) and have been using alcohol for many reasons but more so for calming my moods. I know it exacerbates my mood crashes and my ups and I'm also getting the physical withdrawals. I also know it's not safe for me to just stop but I find it extremely difficult cutting down until it's safe to stop.
I've been panicking about there being no alcohol at the shops which adds to that shame and brings on anger bursts and panicking attacks.
I just dont want to feel like this anymore. I'm bricking it but sitting here with my coffee and typing this out makes me realise the time might be now and I could do with some advice. 
I also want to thank you all on this reddit talking about your experiences. You are all very brave. üëä respect. I dont use AA as it havnt worked for me I'm not shutting it off. I'd like to share however.

402,1,"We tried to go sober before the virus hit, I'm not really a drinker but he's a heavy drinker. My husband is an alcoholic and ever since this whole Covid-19 quarintine my husband has had me go out and pick up more alcohol every single  day he's been home. He's been home since Thursday and as of right now asleep on my lap in a drunken nap. When he gets up to go to bed he'll stumble, knock things over, and fall, not plop, into bed and take up most of it. I won't be able to sleep due to this. I hate, absolutely hate his drinking because if I so happen to say or act anything less than fine he'll get upset, we'll fight and life would be hell for 3 days....and if I happen to mention anything about it he gets upset and moody til he drinks again. sorry needed to vent.

I don't drink very often - especially not now that bars are closed and I'm out of my bartending job. I really enjoy being sober from alcohol. I don't even prefer to drink on the weekends anymore.

However, alcohol just doesn't give him the same negative effects as it does for me. I don't want him to feel lonely in his regular/normal drinking habits but when I drink, I DRINK and I can't always control it. So I would rather just not.

He's the type who can just have a few cocktails or beers and stop. I am not.

 I got in a big fight with my fiancee yesterday over money. I have been using alcohol as a way to cope with our current financial situation.

 She is giving me an ultimatum to get control of my drinking or she is out. I have wanted to get a handle on this for some time but now is when I want to start.
 I want to be a better, healthier person and starting today I pledge to get on that wagon with you guys."
408,1,"It‚Äôs so hard for me to say this but I need help.  I‚Äôm an alcoholic.  I‚Äôm not... I don‚Äôt know.  I don‚Äôt drink enough to get hungover.  I don‚Äôt black out.  I don‚Äôt forget what happened the day before or get into wild rows with loved ones.

But I‚Äôd be stressed out about something and a shot of &lt;something&gt; would dull it and I‚Äôd be able to focus on happy things!

And I started doing that more evenings than not.

Then it started creeping up earlier in the day.

And now, whenever I walk into the kitchen, I just think... I could have a quick nip of &lt;whatever&gt;.  I don‚Äôt have to even be upset.

I don‚Äôt want this.  I don‚Äôt like where I am and I know where it‚Äôs going is someplace worse.

I want to not drink.

I don‚Äôt want to be tempted... but if I am, I want to know that I‚Äôm strong enough to resist and to be proud of myself for doing so.  I don‚Äôt want to be so ashamed of myself.  I don‚Äôt want to be so weak.

I‚Äôve tried to ‚Äúnot drink‚Äù every day for the last two weeks.  I‚Äôve failed.  I have failed.  Every day, I have failed.

I don‚Äôt want to be a failure."
409,1,Being sober during quarantine has been integral to overcoming myself. How have y‚Äôall been taking care of yourself and your sobriety?
410,1,"Man, I wish people wouldn‚Äôt post pictures of alcohol. I just saw one with a grilled steak and bake potato and a rolling rock. Made me want a beer so bad. Grilling and drinking- I used to love that. Have been getting the feeling I want to drink a beer, so far I‚Äôve been able to push the feeling away without even coming close but it still gets me sometimes. Suppose I‚Äôll distract myself until I‚Äôm no longer tempted. IWNDWYT"
411,1,"Anyone else ever get to the end of the day after all the cravings pass and get super excited because you know tomorrow is going to be freakin awesome?!

412,1,Been drinking for days now.. I think I may have messed up my collar bone last night. I drank myself stupid last night.. Been telling myself I'm good and don't need AA but I keep finding myself drunk as fuck multiple times a week. This fucking quarantine isn't helping I guess. Literally can do shit but sit at home or go to work. Been off since Tuesday and have drank to blackout 2 or 3 times. I hate myself and don't know why I keep drinking. Here's to another day one tomorrow.
413,1,"today marks 7 days sober for me in a long long time.  

I‚Äôm only 21, a junior in college and pretty damn good at school, but 

I‚Äôve been perpetually fucked up for the past year or so.  Addy in the morning, liquor by night.  When i started feeling my liver 6 months ago, i didn‚Äôt stop. Kept going, although not as hard because i knew it was killing me. So i substituted smoking pot for drinking.  Still kept popping the addies like candy, and would smoke all day every day, and still binge drank on occasion. 

Finally after spring break, i knew my body was at a breaking point.  

Began having more episodes of fluid retention after nights out, and started feeling like my body was gonna crap out any second.  

And fuck seeing a doctor, I‚Äôm 21, I can‚Äôt have liver issues on my parents‚Äô medical insurance.

Thank God for coronavirus.  Got home to quarantine with the family, and so I have no access to substances whatsoever.  

Bottom line: after 7 days sober i already have huge cognitive improvements.  no more fluid in my ankles.  I can comprehend my schoolwork again.  The fatty liver pain/ inflammation that was engulfing my abdomen is now just occasional mild discomfort that will go away soon as long as i keep eating healthy and stay off the booze/pills.  I‚Äôm shitting better too ü§§

THATS ONLY 7 DAYS.  IM READY TO SEE WHAT DAY 30 HAS IN STORE

THANK YOU REDDIT.  YOU SAVED MY LIFE üòá"
414,1,"Today is the first week I have gone without drinking in.... I can't remember. I feel like I lost a decade to booze, but really I was using booze to make pushing forward feel OK. I feel better than I ever have and things in life feel a lot clearer. I don't feel good about where I am at but I think that's good, and motivational, because I felt good where I was as long as I was pouring booze down my throat. 

I'm 32 and feel like I'm just starting over, but that's alright. I don't think I'll have any trouble making it through this next week without drink because the thought of going off the rails is a silly notion to have to endure again. 

This isolation is starting to press on me so I just needed to put my thoughts out to anybody. 

Hope ya'll had a good sober weekend!"
415,1,"This Pandemic has taken away every resource I had to help me stay clean. I was doing so good again, and I was keeping so busy. I had to self isolate because of a confirmed case at my work. Guess what I did the entire time.. I stayed clean today, barely, and I just absolutely hate everything. I‚Äôm not at the usual rock bottom, so life doesn‚Äôt suck completely, and no my drinking hasn‚Äôt caused me any immediate issues but I hate it. I don‚Äôt even like drinking anymore, but the despair around me just makes me feel like I need too. 

Please share with me how your handling it. I really need help. 

Thanks. 

Hopefully tomorrow I can read your replies while still being sober!"
416,1,"Been sober for a little over two months and things were going okay for awhile until i officially signed my divorce papers. Now i‚Äôm craving alcohol all the time, wanting to just get drunk all the time and dull my pain. I‚Äôm trying to stay sober, its just getting harder everyday."
417,1,"I quit drinking last Labor Day weekend.  The first two months were the hardest but after that I felt like it got easier - id started to develop some new habits instead of drinking and it gave me an outlet or at least options. 

In November I had a miscarriage and I really really wanted to just drown myself in whiskey but I didn‚Äôt and was so proud of myself. 

This past Friday I had a second miscarriage.  If I felt bad the first time, boy was this time shitty.  The likelihood of miscarrying twice in a row is really low, and so there was definitely a negative spiral for me mentally.  I really wanted a drink. Not just one. I wanted to use alcohol to numb myself to what I was feeling and what I was thinking.  But I knew it wouldn‚Äôt make this any easier. At some point I‚Äôd need to work through all of this. And I didn‚Äôt drink.  I felt like shit and just sat in that feeling.  

I always think of this community when I do feel the urge to drink and am so thankful for all of you.  IWNDWYT."
418,1,"Chronic drinker.  Up to about a handle every dwos for the last 2.5 years.  I got sick last week and couldnt keep any booze down.  Decided to just keep going and ride it out.  Shakes?  Fine.  Sweating fine.  DTS?  Not fine.

I was seeing shit everywhere, then came the voices.  They started benign, then theh started imitating my (25M)'s GF (29F)'s voice and berating me and playing loud ass music constently.  My dreams turned into waking nightmares and sleep suffered.  Currently in the ICU and when i get out i am NOT going back."
419,1,"First time on this sub.  Just checked and I am 138 days sober.  This afternoon was probably the closest I've came to drinking since I started this.  And I would have been completely fine with that.  It would not bother me at all to start over again.

In November I checked into a 35 day rehab.  After that I went to intensive outpatient treatment until last month.  But this whole time I have never really had a strong desire to stop drinking for myself.  I'm 37, support myself and live alone.  So there is no one to hold me accountable.  But I am really close to my parents and can see how happy I am making them when I stop by.  They say I seems much happier and look better.  And I really do feel that way.  But I also feel that if it was not for them I would not be sober.  Same thing with friends, both old ones and ones I'm met in treatment.  I feel like I would let them down if I went back to drinking.  I really wish I was quitting because I wanted to but that is just not the case.  I've been hospitalized several times and found out I have cirrhosis a few years ago.  Did not stop my drinking.  Last year I had a seizure at a concert, an ambulance was called but I refused treatment and went back to the show.  I did go to my parents house that night because I was too worried to be alone and was hallucinating.  I had more and stopped breathing.  My dad had to do cpr on me while my mom watched and called the paramedics.  I spent the next week in the ER.  They were there the whole time.  I feel pretty guilty about this.  They did not deserve that.  But today I really wanted a drink.  And the only thing keeping me from it was I know when they ask how long it's been I would tell them the truth.  And I don't want them to worry.  Really don't know where I was going with this.  Kind of just typing as I go along.  I guess I really just wish I cared as much about my health as others did.  Because I was fine with the way things were going.  Don't think I really had any questions.  Maybe just needed to get this out there."
420,1,"We have some acreage and whenever we light a yard debris burn pile, it makes me anxious, partly rightly so. I was still anxious about it today but a whole lot less so and very grateful to not be running to the liquor cabinet to soothe myself this time. Not sure why I ever thought having a buzz during that project was a good idea! Also made some beer battered asparagus tonight and easily poured the remaining beer down the drain. Feeling good!"
421,1,"He got a DUI that was so bad he had an ankle bracelet on when we first met. I fell in love with him while he was sober the first three months we were together but as soon as it came off he started drinking. I have so many stories of him getting drunk and blacking out... I don‚Äôt have to see the empty cans now to even know if he‚Äôs been drinking I can just tell. Most of the time he‚Äôs functional and it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôve talked to him time after time again on how ‚Äúit‚Äôs not okay‚Äù ‚Äúhow he needs to be utilizing his therapist‚Äù ‚Äúhow I‚Äôm here to support him and talk to him‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve offered to go sober with him, to read self help books to him..‚Äù he used to limit his drinking for me but he could never really limit it and I suspect he lied and hid his drinking a lot. 

Anyways, the past few days my work hours changed so I come home a few hours after him now. And two days in a row I came home to him having drank 5+ big* 9% alcohol contents beers... and then he just passes out in sleep immediately. I get sad when I see him drink like this. I tried to talk to him on the 2nd morning and he opted to go home because he didn‚Äôt want to talk about his drinking. 

I told him I couldn‚Äôt be with him anymore if he‚Äôs going to keep drinking. 

I keep going back and forth on if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. All my friends say to stay strong. And I know I‚Äôve done everything I can for him...I love him so much, but this isn‚Äôt healthy for either of us, and by staying I feel like I‚Äôm supporting his drinking. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place to post this..."
422,1,"It's crazy to think that at least a year ago I thought there was no way I could make it 30 days without drinking. There were times before that too but a year ago was when it was really bad. This whole not working thing has been stupid hard. I have nothing to do at home and I think so much about drinking.  I've been working on keeping my self busy. The best think I've been doing is rollerblading. Keeps me active in this crazy time and its just a really great fun activity. I hope everyone else who is struggling with all this nonsense is doing okay and finding things to keep you busy and stay strong.

423,1,"We (35 F &amp; M) have been together since Christmas, but I have a feeling that I don‚Äôt know the true version of him without alcohol. I‚Äôm so proud of him! Also scared.

425,1,"Hadn‚Äôt had a drink all year. The stress of COVID plus doing a ton of manual labor (working from home) and that‚Äôs that. I thought I deserved a drink. Especially the beers in my fridge that have been there 4 months (it works better for me). Well it‚Äôs not worth it. I don‚Äôt feel awful about it, but it sucks, 89 days is a pretty damn good start. Stay strong friends!"
426,1,"I'm just under 6 months, like just over a week. I find myself looking at the beer aisle in the grocery store. Been thinking about a local DIPA. The idea usually hits me about my normal drinking time; after work, lazy Sundays..... I know I'm better then this, I know where it will go. I know that life, I know how much I hate my old self. I have learned from my past. But, I hope that it will not repeat itself."
428,1,"So it's been, I think, 90 days for me. Some of it has been stressful. I have been self isolating for 2 weeks and there is alcohol in the house. Unsettling times for sure. My job is a maybe. I am a bit at risk for Covid. Still have managed to stay away from booze. But the hardest damn craving was right after I talked to some of my family. The apocalypse? Apparently no problem. My Brother? Hide everything I am manic. Weird. Triggers and issues."
429,1,"I've been sober for 3 months which is something I never thought possible, however now I feel better than ever and have found the strength to turn down drinks even at my most triggering points and I am currently confident with my sobriety going forward.

There are 2 things I'd like advice with however:

1. Spots!! I am female and 26 years old, never had a problem with them except the occasional one when I am due on my period, now I have them all the time, on my face and I'm starting to get them on my chest and back, I'm literally starting to look like I have chicken pox!

2. I suffer from PTSD from a traumatic childhood, this has got progressively worse but now is also tied to the horrendous, embarrassing and dangerous things I did while struggling with alcohol, it keeps me up at night and it just wont stop.

I had been a heavy daily drinker for the past 7 years. Any advice would be appreciated with how to cope"
430,1,"Today has to be day one. I've known for awhile that I have a problem but didn't think I needed to do anything about it. I thought I can control myself, I just have to drink in moderation. Nope! Moderation does not work  because I have a problem. I woke up this morning and decided today is the day! It has to be the day. I wrote myself a letter to read for when I feel like drinking and made a list of reasons why I should have that drink. My roommate has offered me alcohol twice and I'm going to keep saying no. I'm really motivated to stop drinking and feel like I've done good today. But this is just one day out of many. I'm ready for this journey and thankful for this subreddit.

431,1,"My mom has had a 20 plus long battle with drug and alcohol abuse. I have really distanced myself from her for the last decade because of that. I have seen/called her probably3 or 4 times a year for the past few years my sister has attempted to make amends with her a few times. She left my step dad this past week. She tried to move in with my little sister and we told her she couldn't do that but we would help her if she agreed to get help. (I am 30 years old sister is 26ish her in this condition is basically all we have know of her). We basically had a intervention with her and she agreed to stop drinking and enter a detox clinic tomorrow (we want her to be safe being a multiple decade long alcoholic with some drug abuse.) She said she wants me and my sister back in her life and seems genuine. I have been making sure to call her every day and reinforce that I am here for her. I have arranged a sobriety program once she is finished with detox and found her a place to stay afterwards. What else can I do to see her succeed. What signs should I look for that she is about to back slide. I want to see her healthy and to once again have her in my life.

Basically I want to know how can I be a good support system but not get taken advantage of or become an enabler. What did family members do for you that was helpful and harmful to your sobriety?

I don't know if I am allowed to post here since I don't struggle with addiction myself. If this is against the rules you may remove it but is there another place I can seek help to ensure she gets clean."
432,1,"My life has steadily improved since quitting.  All the things I‚Äôve posted about in the past are getting better, like sleep, mental health, etc. I‚Äôm still seeing a therapist and have lost 70 lbs now (started a diet also, so that‚Äôs not just from quitting booze). None of this is going to happen overnight but it‚Äôs all worth it.

I won‚Äôt lie, I still have to watch myself. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about drinking and drugs lately. I‚Äôve found myself thinking about a couple of bachelor weekends that I know are coming up in the next year, about how nice it will be to get a big bag of blow and a handle of scotch and let it all hang out for a couple of days. But then I think about how it just won‚Äôt be as fun as it used to be and it‚Äôll only lead to me falling off the wagon for month if not years. I know it‚Äôs not worth it but I sometimes wonder if those urges ever completely leave. 

Anyway, good luck to all in these bizarre times."
433,1,"       hello! new here I am 29 years old. long story short 3 years when I met my gf I got thrown into jail for a month due to a DUI ‚Äúhad to detox from 7 years of daily klonopin use &amp;amp; alcohol‚Äù that was the worst experience of my life. So after that I was living the sober life for 7 months which was AMAZING, all my close friends are drug/ alcoholics and talked me into just having a couple beers. due to my kindled brain I had to cut them off completely after that relapse. my gf drank every day but i lived with her so I had to stay strong mentally to continue my sobriety. I dealt with daily anxiety/depression and she always left to go party with them EVERY weekend, I tried so hard to make that relationship work but i kept relapsing due to my addiction. I had to see it filled in the fridge, cabinets..  when she drinks we always fight, if she‚Äôs sober we are a perfect couple. 
       we were crazy in love but as time went by it kept falling apart due to different lifestyles. I lost my job due to depression from drinking, and when I told her we got in a huge fight ‚Äúshe wanted a break‚Äù then one night she left to go party with the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù &amp;amp;  didn‚Äôt come home. she did cocaine with my ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend of 20 years n slept with him. I was devastated.. that type of betrayal is THE worst emotion I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I moved out the day after, she expected me to live with her and sleep in the same bed while she dates him. I‚Äôm still in shock, I now live with my mom &amp;amp; relapsed BAD for the final time two days ago. I am in a very dark place filled with anxiety. this virus is not helping my situation... I‚Äôm praying since all those fake people are out of my life I can finally be the healthy person who I want to be. I‚Äôm just so alone &amp;amp; bored, that‚Äôs all I can think about!!! I just needed to vent, longest I‚Äôve been sober is 9 months.. I know I can do it. cheers to day 2"

I‚Äôve truly got everything to be sober for, but my mind is taking advantage of the way I‚Äôm feeling (down) today, telling me, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of anything if you‚Äôre going to feel like this forever?‚Äù

But I won‚Äôt feel like this forever.  In these 8 days I‚Äôve had truly great days and some not so great.  It seems like every other day is great and every other I‚Äôm not feeling up to tackling it.  I don‚Äôt know when it gets better or even how so.  But I have to have faith and know that it will.  One day, hopefully I will look back and see today as just another stumble on a rock on the side of the mountain I climbed.  

This will pass.  I will not drink with y‚Äôall today."
437,1,"Hi everyone,  
 
I thought I would pass on some advice that still helps me on a daily basis. We are all currently in circumstances (due to quarantine) that may be putting ourselves at risk for relapse. A very simple lesson I was taught by my sponsor at the beginning of my sobriety was to ""play the tape forward"".  
 
So, what does that mean? Well, if you're considering drinking, think about your future. It's both that simple and that complex. Imagine what the next few hours look like after you took that drink. Are you drunk now? Are you unable to keep promises you made, do the things you needed to etc? Take a look at next morning. Boy, I bet that hangover is going to be great isn't it? Those feelings of regret and shame because you let yourself down? It won't stop there. Think a couple weeks in the future, by then you might have had a full blown relapse. What is your life like now. Think of all those things before you take that first drink.  
 
Remember, alcohol is a temporary solution to a permanent problem. Drinking is not going to fix your issues, your problems, it will only make them worse. So, when you're about to take that first drink, just remember to play the tape forward."

Honestly I‚Äôm not sure how many more chances I‚Äôm going to get. My health is deteriorating with every binge. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore and the depression is overwhelming.

450,1,"Hey y'all, just found this sub a couple weeks ago. I'm marking today as day 1 of stopping drinking. I wanted to make this post just for some additional accountability after reading through quite a few other posts. Reading peoples stories is helping motivate me to finally start doing this.

I'm 25 and mainly have a problem drinking beer. I don't drink to get drunk very often but I find myself drinking at least two 24oz beers every day. I hardly ever take a break and when I do it's usually only for a day. Even though I'm not getting shit faced, I can still feel it zapping my productivity and creativity and putting me in this apathetic, low energy state. 

I'm just so tired of it but it's freaking hard. I've quit weed before and I've quit smoking cigarettes but this is a different beast.

Anyways, just wanted to share my experience a bit and hopefully glean some wisdom from this sub.

Thanks for reading"
451,1,"While unpacking books and putting them on the shelf, I noticed that I had marked a passage in *The Kite Runner* by Khaled Hosseini. I was curious, so I flipped to the flagged page and read this line:

""...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night"" (Ch. 25; p. 359 in the Riverhead trade paperback version that I have).

I love this line, because it reminds me that if we let them, pain and negative emotions *will* subside and leave us with a feeling of acceptance. It is a natural progression, a sort of incremental healing, that allows us to make peace with ourselves and with others who may have caused us pain.

I thought I had something more profound to say about this, but still, I hope that the quote resonates with at least one other SDer."

453,1,"Today marks 90-days of sobriety. Today marks a week since my uncle passed away. Three friends had babies in the last 30-days. I‚Äôve lost track of how long I‚Äôve been WFH since our city went into quarantine, and it has been months since the globe has been at war with a virus. How the world has changed in 90-days!

What do these 90-days mean to me? They mean discipline. They mean willpower. They mean an active choice in repeatedly electing to not engage in a specific activity. It means maturity. It means knowing‚Äîor growing to know‚Äîwhat‚Äôs good for me and what isn‚Äôt.

It means listening to myself more closely‚Äîlistening to the thoughts that make me uncomfortable and addressing them face on. It means catching the behaviors I turned into habits and undoing them‚Äîlike a ball of tangled yarn. It means realizing that I am lucky to do this again for another 90-days, and another 90 after that. It means being lucky to have my husband support me, to have him by my side,through another 90 and another 90 after that...

It means knowing that I‚Äôm going to want to drink sometimes and knowing that I‚Äôll just need to sit there with that feeling of want...and actively electing‚Äîagain‚Äîto not engage with that feeling.

I want to say that I am proud of myself, or that I‚Äôve changed in some way, but I don‚Äôt feel that way. Maybe it‚Äôs not so much about changing as an individual, and maybe more about changing my actions. I still want to drink, I‚Äôm just not going to."

457,1,"Not sure my exact date but I helped my friend move in on the extra leap year day 2/29, and know for certain it was prior to that I had my last drink. I have no urges to even try to have one or drink in moderation. Which I‚Äôm sure those may comeback later, but for now I‚Äôm feeling good, getting productive. Been wanting a dog for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt take care of one one for many reasons including my drinking habits. But now with those not being an impediment, extra cash from no longer spending it boos, &amp; other things falling in place; I‚Äôm actively looking to rescue myself a companion and accountability partner that I can spoil with love &amp; attention. Looking for a big fluffy cuddly teddy-bear-esq dog; Pyrenees, Husky, Berner‚Äôs, Keeshonds, etc.

458,1,"It‚Äôs weird because he‚Äôs a genuinely decent human being. We‚Äôve always gotten along well. But lately my no drinking has been bothering him and he keeps telling me that as soon as I hit 1 year and humans can be around each other again he‚Äôll bring alcohol to mine and we‚Äôll drink together. I keep saying I won‚Äôt do that as I‚Äôm quitting for good but he won‚Äôt have it.

Just very frustrating and making me miss the times when I could sit and drink with him. I really wish he would be more supportive.

461,1,"I fell off the wagon due to excuses this weekend. 

I feel better, but also, worse. 

Today we gotta go for provisions. I‚Äôm torn between stocking up and making sure I have nothing so I can‚Äôt at all."
462,1,"What sort of changes in your brain can you expect after giving up drinking? And are these changes still there for someone who was an occasional binge drinker rather than a daily drinker? Most advice seems to be aimed at the latter.

41 days for me today :)"
463,1,"The breaks in my routine, the isolation, the lack of being able to pursue my regular outlets. I have struggled so much over the past week and it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting better. 

I don‚Äôt feel as though I am in danger of actually drinking, but I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel bored, lonely and the hopeless feeling just won‚Äôt go away.

I am finding all of this very difficult. I just wanted to post here because I knew it was one place to find comfort.

I hope you‚Äôre all doing as well as can be."
464,1,"This was not caused by drinking in my case.  I started drinking more and more because ever since the first time, it made me feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Made me actually feel emotion and feel sociable and like I could actually have fun and be fun.  

I‚Äôve always been emotionally numb ever since I can remember.  I cannot even taste or smell very well.  It is like I am in a prison and just little glimpses of emotion or sensory input come through by the window every once in a while just so I know what I‚Äôm missing.

When I have alcohol is the only time I want to do anything and feel any true enjoyment.  It is the only time I feel like a full human being.  I workout a lot.  Probably way too much as a result of this because the temporary endorphins almost cut it for a little while but then they‚Äôre gone and I‚Äôm sore and just want a drink so I can feel.  Anything.  

I‚Äôd like to say I could go the rest of my life without a drink but that would mean going the rest of my life never truly feeling anything or annoying anything.  I‚Äôm tired of faking smiles and feigning a laugh just to appear normal or to not hurt someone‚Äôs feelings.  I want to be real."
465,1,"I feel so much better yet so exhausted. I keep thinking about my detox in the hospital and how crazy withdrawal can get with the hallucinations.  

I‚Äôm very certain that my experience will never cause me to ever drink, again. Shit was scary, but I‚Äôm glad I swallowed my pride and got medical help.

466,1,"I'm on Twitter a lot and there are so many beer ads, beer for delivery, etc. I can't post this on Facebook because no one wants to hear from the sober person, but I want to shout it ... BEER IS NOT YOUR FRIEND, especially in these times! You will make your depression WORSE! You will wake up the next morning and look at all the empty beer cans in your living room, and the day, and your loneliness, will seem colder than ever. Your family might also be mad at you. You lay on the couch ranting, or you went for a stupid, dangerous drive, or you accidentally alienated your neighbor.

Every day that you do not drink, you heal. Every time you get yourself back on that wagon, you learn.

467,1,"I‚Äôm glad I found this sub, you all seem very encouraging. I work in a career where alcoholism is a pretty common problem- (outsiders of the career would never guess this, but teachers tend to have serious rates of alcoholism.) My job is ridiculously stressful, my boyfriend just broke up with me, I‚Äôm quarantined with my parents as an adult... the triggers for drinking go on. 
Last night I had a few more drinks than I should have, just sitting at home. I wasn‚Äôt blackout or anything like that, it‚Äôs just not healthy. I want to stop drinking, because like many of you have posted about, I usually can‚Äôt handle moderation. 
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done any real health damage yet but I really don‚Äôt want it to get there. My family has a history of alcoholism. 
I‚Äôm gonna keep reading this sub for tips, etc. I guess this is more of an accountability post!"
468,1,"I live in the rural midwest in a small town. We have an active home group with five meetings per week (two midday and three at night) ... four out of five of our meetings are smoking so we're pretty popular. Our mix is a good blend of old-timers and newcomers and many of our group don't have smart phones or computers.

The larger community a half hour down the road is having meetings on Zoom but that's beyond the reach of many of our members. So I set up a telephone conference meeting scheduled for 1pm central. I am pretty tech savvy but not all that confident. I keep stressing Tradition 9 --- we ought never be organized.

I'm feeling as nervous as I did chairing my very first meeting so many years ago ---- I better get a quick cup of coffee to make this experience feel even a little bit normal. 

Please don't let technology get in the way of connecting to another alcoholic to stay sober. Back in the 30s, there were sober drunks communicating with each other by written letter and snail mail because long-distance calling was not an option. Surely we can do this if they could do that and stay sober and build a foundation that I still walk upon 80 years later.

I'm gonna miss the hugs and holding hands. I miss my family-of-choice. Please wish us luck or send your prayers or however you tap into the power that is apparently better at running my life than I am. The Language of the Heart in the power of one alcoholic reaching out and helping another alcoholic has been the life-breath of my life for decades, I can't let this damn virus destroy my recovery. Hugs"
469,1,I‚Äôm well onto completing day 10. I had an easier time falling asleep last night so I think that‚Äôs improving. I‚Äôm not sure but I feel like my face is let red. Is that possible already?  I‚Äôm still nervous I‚Äôll slip up but am happy to be as far as I am. Looking forward to seeing double digits.
470,1,"The last couple weeks have been rough.  Locked in house, worrying about COVID, and drinking way too much.  Anxiety has been through the roof. On Friday morning, I decided it was time for this to end.  After drinking for 30 years (more in the last few), I just want to go back to seeing the world as a kid where alcohol wasn't a part of my life.  I told my wife and best friends. Everyone was supportive. 

For fear of withdrawal issues and crowded hospitals, I have been splitting one bottle over these last 3 days.  One more glass tonight.  I just feel like I'm taking medicine. No joy in it.  Want it to be over.  Not giving advice.  This is just the way I've chosen to do it.  Feeling strong now and ready for a life free of this poison."
471,1,"two weeks ago i decided to moderate drinking, within 72 hours of making that decision was back to waking up from a blackout surrounded by empty beer cans and praying i didnt finish off the whiskey the night before to aide with the hangover.  i knew i was on a slippery slope, and where it ends.  i knew if i were to stop soon enough i could avoid what is the detox hell.  i woke yesterday sometime mid afternoon, the place is dirty to a level where i am embarassed to call it my home.  i tried to get some whiskey down after waking up but couldnt keep it down.  i tried hard to get drunk enough to get out of this hang over.  so just like the end of my last three benders, i knew i was headed into withdrawal mode and fast.  fuck.  at least i can try to taper. i can do it from home and dont put stress on ERs at the peak of corona.  i took some zofran and began to toss and turn all night.  didnt sleep a wink, and sometime this morning i think right around 6 am i realized how epically bad my taper attempt went last time.  so i bit the bullet and went in.  normally i would wait until the last possible minute to go but i was having a panic attack and shortness of breath.  really scared i packed an overnight bag, and ran out.  normally i would shower quickly before i go in, but i felt like was gonna sieze out, lose conciousness, or having my breathing worsen.  i havent showered and im sure i smell great coming off this bender i dont remember. ive been trying to be extremely appreciative of my nurses and docs thanking them, and telling them i tried to do withdrawals at home in order to lessen stress of ER work(ers). everyone here has been super nice and professional even though im a frequent flyer in the ER as a drunk, look and smell like shit, and was here literally one month ago for the same reason, tehy were all super nice and proffesional.  usually i just get a scrip for librium and am out of the ER back home within a few hours.  i guess becuase of the time of day, extremely early, there were no other patients i think.  they hook up IVs and get me going, im sweating bullets and shaking as he tries for a vein.  and expecting to be home in a little bit.  aparently i was elevated heart rates when i came in, something they always see when i come in so i wasnt expecting too much from them. then they asked if i was interesting to stay for observation and lowering the heart rate over time.   so im still here, now in my own room. glad i brought my laptop"
472,1,"I'm stuck in the house with the kids under a ""Stay Home"" statewide order, the only thing to do is clean and watch reruns, I'm worried about finances and the future, and the weather is too rainy to even venture out for a walk.............And I've never been happier! Thank you sobriety! 

Take care all!"
473,1,"What‚Äôs up my people ! These last few weeks have been really tough for us but everyday I wake up sober is a good day .  I have experienced a lot of positive changes in the last few months and I‚Äôm glad to say I‚Äôm here and sober af because of you people .  Thanks for posting , thanks for sharing , thanks for asking and giving support.  I‚Äôm seeing a lot of new folks posting for the first time and to you I say be strong and find your support if you have none irl this place is very positive and has helped me though the first few months .  Take care all !! 

I won‚Äôt drink with you today !!"
474,1," After 15 years of pretty hard drinking, I decided I needed to keep my wits about me during this pandemic. I live in SE Asia and the hospitals are overwhelmed, but gabapentin and valium are over the counter. So I prescribed them to myself and took them for three days to avoid DT's and...I have been so distracted by the global madness that I haven't once wanted a drink. I haven't been counting days but it's been roughly two weeks. So odd, as normally the slightest inconvenience leads directly to hard liquor. 


Anyway, I hope the virus goes away soon and this part stays.

Stay safe everyone!"
475,1,"I‚Äôve said it a thousand times, but I‚Äôm sick of hangovers. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I turned 34 two days ago. As the great Murtaugh said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting too old for this s***‚Äù. I was a decent athlete in high school and into college, but 12ish years of heavy drinking has led to 280 pounds of lard. I have four young children that want to play outside (it‚Äôs a beautiful Spring day), but Daddy is stuck on the couch recovering. Luckily, underneath all this blubber I ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like there is still a strong body in there. Starting tomorrow morning, I intend to go running through the neighborhood before the family wakes up, and do it every day. No excuses. I pray that my body, including my liver, will forgive me for my transgressions, and bounce back for one heck of a second act. Thanks for reading!"
477,1,"Thank you SD. I would have never made it without you. Keep sharing your stories, keep making that commitment for today. 

We are watching the movie 300 today (I‚Äôve never seen it) and I am feeling incredibly grateful for this day. 

My life feels like it used to be in black and white, and i was just a passive participant (or an embarrassing or negative character) Now, it is in color, I am active, I am vibrant. It is not always perfect, but my coping mechanisms are continuing to improve and my brain expanding to thinking of all that I could be, all that life can offer, and all of the amazing things to take in (tastes, sights, smells, touch, all unseen while drunk) 

I appreciate every one of you. Thank you for the encouragement, and the positivity this group of internet strangers has for each other. We are all in this together. 

I believe in you, and IWNDWYT.

To 300. No retreat, no surrender."
478,1,"It's been awhile since I've been on this site. I had 9 months of sobriety and I was truly in such a good place. I have no dramatic story, I just slowly started having a glass of wine a night that turned into a bottle a night and so on. Then with all of this craziness going on in the world and my family's business being so heavily effected made me really start drinking extra heavily, I used the pandemic as an excuse as to why I ""needed"" alcohol to relieve my stress. Two days ago I woke up feeling like death and decided it was time to shoot for 9 months again, hopefully much longer this time. Thank you for being here! once again, I will not drink with you today!"
479,1,"So I havn't had a drink in almost 24 hrs and have tried drinking but even smelling the vodka makes me sick so I just I just threw it away, but really I'm so tired of it all. I have not been drinking for too long, a little over a year but recently relapsed after 6 months of sobriety. I'm 23 and usually detox at a hospital but with everything that is going on I don't want to go to the ER and take up a bed someone might really need. I'm scared of the symptoms without the medications they usually give me, so does anybody have any advice on detoxing at home?"
480,1,"My best friend shared this sub with me and I can‚Äôt thank him enough. Seeing and reading people‚Äôs post and comments gives me so much hope and the reason is I know I am not alone anymore. Seeing how so many struggle through the same thing I am, even to the point I am like they took the words right out of my mouth haha. Also to see a community that is so helpful and supportive is amazing. It is crazy times now but there are still amazing people out there. So just wanted to say thanks and here is to another day sober!!"
481,1,"I think I am scared of living the rest of my life without alcohol to escape. There's a decent probability that I still have a lot of life left to live and that is a scary thought with so many unanswerable questions about how it will go.  I know that I have my own actions for how to live my life, but sometimes I just get confused and overwhelmed by living.

I have had many failures related to alcohol. I feel old and pretty tired of it already. I'm at a point now where I can drink once and am naturally deterred from it for a few days to weeks, and can moderate my feelings to suit sobriety. But then the intense desire to drink comes when the stress, self-loathing, loneliness, pain, or anxiety comes hard. When the strong urge to drink comes, it's usually in the evening and I am afraid of laying in bed at night sober and unable to fall asleep. Last night I drank a bottle of wine, then went out on my bike to the gas station for more alcohol.

I am afraid that other young people I'd like to know (friends, lovers) will think I am boring, mentally unstable, or a burden since having to manage sobriety for me requires either releasing/surrendering or overcoming the urge to drink. I know the ""release"" doesn't have to be so solemn, but it kinda is for me right now. And the ""overcoming"" can make me irritable. Neither are feelings I want the people I love to have to go through with me and both make me want to isolate myself from them, which is probably worse than just letting them be a part of my life. 

I don't know. Clarity is fleeting and there's a maze to find it. Does the maze change where I need to adapt to get there? Right now I'm lost and I feel young and inexperienced at getting out of this maze. Sober, but still lost."
482,1,"So my wife and I are on day 3 of our taper.  We have a ways to go, but are doing well.  We normally drink beer and then wine later in the evenings, and not Bud Light, but typically higher ABV craft beer (7% or higher).  So what we decided to eliminate wine and for now, go with nothing greater than 6%, and work downwards from there.  As a result, I feel a ton better this morning, and didn't have the 3am anxiety wake up.

Plus, yesterday, we stayed really busy working on our yard, and talking about what we're doing.  Also got a 4 mile run in.  Feels like we have some momentum, if only in the very early stages.  Today, we're taking the bikes to a trail and will ride and enjoy being outdoors.

Another thing we did was talk to our daughters about what we're doing.  As a father, I don't want to forego this opportunity to teach our daughters.  They're 17 and 14, and both are not really down with booze. They've seen what it can do.  Stupid bickering, grumpiness, and the shame we feel when they ask us ""why are you going to the store.""  Tired of that shit.  No more.

Anyways, happy Sunday everyone."

484,1,"After quitting drinking for a while after reading this naked mind, I had gotten comfortable with drinking every once in while. Add that flexibility to mandatory quarantine, and for me it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster. I‚Äôve overdone it two nights in a row, and I‚Äôm constantly having ‚Äúdrinking dreams‚Äù where I essentially ruin my life while wasted and wake up so relieved it‚Äôs not real. My subconscious is yelling at me to get it together. I‚Äôm definitely home until April 14, so I‚Äôm trying to think of a positive goal to set for myself. Meditating, working out, reading? I want something interesting that drinking will get in the way of. If anyone has any ideas or wants to join the ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù, please let me know! Thanks to this sub for always being there, even when I get lost."
485,1,Last night I had a drinking dream. I was at my old apartment and there was a package store and dive bar literally a 3 minute walk away from my old apartment. I usually only went to the package store as I was more of a stay at home drinker. The only other thing I remember in my dream was walking to the bar. I kinda miss those days. My drinking seemed to be more managed and the hangovers weren't nearly as bad and I would have no withdrawal symptoms.
486,1,"I bought an old boat and am doing it up. I have so much free time and energy its awesome. I have been spending money on quality tools instead of cheap crap so i can spend more on booze. How stupid is rationalizing booze over actual useful things??

I forgot how much i love fixing things. I think my hands are even shaking less.

Im still not exactly saving heaps of money by not smoking and drinking but i have a boat and useful things. I have always wanted a boat but never had money for it cos i spent it all on booze n drugs. Its only a small 16ft and i got it for 250 bucks on a old trailer. Both need work, my friends gonna teach me to weld to fix a few things...

Anyways this isnt a boat support group lol i just wanted to check in and share my little piece of sober life thats giving me joy and to thank this sub for helping me get the sober ball rolling.

Stay safe, stay healthy and stay positive!

Hope you all had a good weekend despite these crazy times, if not, keep positive and stay strong!"

489,1,"I‚Äôm not a drunk. I‚Äôm a moderate drinker. It doesn‚Äôt effect my life, relationships, or work. This makes it hard to stop. I don‚Äôt have a good reason to stop drinking. And I don‚Äôt want to stop drinking. But I do want to get it under control. I don‚Äôt want to end up becoming an alcoholic. A true alcoholic that is. I do in fact drink every day, and have for the last 10 years.  I guess I‚Äôm an alcoholic but not a drunkaholic. There is a difference. My dad has had a beer after work every day for the last 20 years probably. But that‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs never gotten worse. That‚Äôs something I can live with. That said, I would like to have days every week where I don‚Äôt drink at all. With stress being a killer, it‚Äôs actually healthy I think to have a single drink every day. 

But only if you have just the one. I have two or three. Not good. 

All that said, I‚Äôm open to stopping completely for a while. Or stopping completely on weekdays. 

I‚Äôm not at a place with drinking where this should be so hard. I don‚Äôt need to go to AA. I won‚Äôt have withdrawal symptoms. I wouldn‚Äôt be craving it like mad. I did go one day without drinking last month. It wasn‚Äôt hard. 

Yet every day I go for a walk, and I pass the liquor store and grab my usual 2 beers. Sometimes 3. And more on the weekends. 

While I‚Äôm not a problem drinker, and will never hit rock bottom, I also don‚Äôt fall into the ‚Äúhave one drink a day because it‚Äôs healthy‚Äù category. I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle. I have a couple of drinks to deal with work / life stress. I don‚Äôt like that I rely on it for that. I need to learn to cope with stress without substances. 

I used to smoke pot every night. Stopped that years ago. I had a dependency on pain killers. Took care of that. I stopped smoking a few months ago. 

I‚Äôm heading in the right direction. Cutting down on drinking is the final thing on my list to live a healthy life. 

But I‚Äôm finding it hard to let go of this last thing. 

Any advice would be appreciated."
490,1,"My doc gave me some benzos to get though withdrawals (8 days sober!!!)... when I run out of those he gave me Selincro.... which is supposed to block urges? It‚Äôs also used to get people off heroin, so I guess it‚Äôs pretty effective.... any thoughts?"

492,1,"Just wondering. Surprisingly, I have managed to keep my drinking a secret, and my problems as well. I do not think my family would approve of me, and they would likely be more stressed out with the virus, then me and my issues.

I Will Not Drink With You Today


Morpheus: ""It is sometimes a mistake to climb. It is always a mistake never even to make the attempt... If you do not climb you will not fall. This is true. But is it that bad to fall, that hard to fall? Sometimes you wake, and sometimes, yes, you die. But there is a third alternative.""

Honour for sure! Common shoot me good Brandon aim and fire we will be parents before we are 26 I hope! It would give me no choice and I‚Äôd have a beautiful man to help me raise them.
